| 10 | Coming to America | 1988 | Jan 15 | I had low expectations, but it was better than I thought it would be. Ma would like it! | 3.5 |
| 11 | MIB International | 2019 | Jan 15 | Kind of predictable | 3 |

| 13 | 6 Underground | 2019 | Jan 17 | The editing and scene transitions were all over the place. A very Michael Bay film. | 3.5 |
| 14 | The Wolf of Wall Street | 2013 | Jan 18 | This movie does nothing to improve my opinion of modern capitalism. | 4.5 |
| 15 | Parasite | 2019 | Jan 19 | Really good, but IDK how to begin to describe it. Worth overcoming the 1 inch subtitle barrier for. | 5 |
| 16 | Kiki's Delivery Service | 1989 | Feb 04 | Very light-hearted and idyllic. At first it felt a bit boring, but it had me smiling by the end. | 5 |
