**Roy Tang** Programmer, engineer, scientist, critic, gamer, dreamer, and kid-at-heart. [Magic][1] player on weekends. Frustrated writer and sketch artist. Student of life and all-around good guy. On a never-ending quest for awesomeness.

I'm a software developer by profession, currently working for [Maroon Studios][2]. I'm not averse to freelance consulting, if you have something interesting for me. I like Python and JavaScript, but I'm always willing to learn new things. Here's [my profile on LinkedIn][3].

For more frequent short bursts of my nonsense, follow [me on Twitter.][4] For sketches and other stuff, follow [me on Instagram][5].

This site is hosted on [Webfaction][6]. If you are interested in web hosting services, kindly support me by using [my affiliate link][6].

Best way to contact me is Twitter, DMs are open. You can also reach me at <awesome@roytang.net>
