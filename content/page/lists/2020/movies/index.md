|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Sicario | 2015 | Jan 05 | Great thriller movie, but the lesson here is so bleak | 5 |
| 2 | Paprika | 2006 | Jan 08 | Colorful, vivid and great animation but so so bizaare | 4 |
| 3 | Birdman | 2014 | Jan 08 | Insanely good, I can see why it won best picture | 5 |
| 4 | Looper | 2012 | Jan 09 | Entertaining enough, but raises so many time travel questions | 4 |
| 5 | John Wick 2 | 2017 | Jan 12 | Better than I expected | 5 |
| 6 | Ad Astra | 2019 | Jan 13 | Kinda draggy | 3.5 |
| 7 | Klaus | 2019 | Jan 13 | Surprisingly good. Fantastic animation | 5 |
| 8 | Marriage Story | 2019 | Jan 14 | Great performances. Ma didn't like the ending. | 5 |
| 9 | Fist of Fury | 1972 | Jan 14 | Great fight scenes. Actually a bit more plot than I expected | 5 |
| 10 | Coming to America | 1988 | Jan 15 | I had low expectations, but it was better than I thought it would be. Ma would like it! | 3.5 |
| 11 | MIB International | 2019 | Jan 15 | Kind of predictable | 3 |
| 12 | Batman vs TMNT | 2019 | Jan 16 | Ridiculous, but fun. Good for kids. | 4 |
| 13 | 6 Underground | 2019 | Jan 17 | The editing and scene transitions were all over the place. A very Michael Bay film. | 3.5 |
| 14 | The Wolf of Wall Street | 2013 | Jan 18 | This movie does nothing to improve my opinion of modern capitalism. | 4.5 |
| 15 | Parasite | 2019 | Jan 19 | Really good, but IDK how to begin to describe it. Worth overcoming the 1 inch subtitle barrier for. | 5 |
| 16 | Kiki's Delivery Service | 1989 | Feb 04 | Very light-hearted and idyllic. At first it felt a bit boring, but it had me smiling by the end. | 5 |
| 17 | Uncut Gems | 2019 | Feb 07 | Sandler gave a good performance, but I struggled to get through the early parts of the movies because his character and situation are so unrelatable to me personally. | 4 |
| 18 | Knives Out | 2019 | Feb 09 | A fantastic murder mystery, maybe the best I've ever seen, great performances all around. | 5 |
| 19 | Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World | 2003 | Feb 10 | Watched this because a redditor said ROTK robbed it of best picture in 2003. This is a great war movie, but he was wrong | 5 |
| 20 | Jojo Rabbit | 2019 | Feb 11 | Best movie about a Nazi ever. Most colorful depiction of Nazi Germany. Fantastic movie. | 5 |
| 21 | Superman: Red Son | 2020 | Feb 27 | An acceptable adaptation of one of my favorite Superman stories. Minus points for not including the "House of L" epilogue. | 4 |
| 22 | Coach Carter | 2005 | Feb 27 | I watched this because I saw it in a "top inspirational speeches" YT video. Pretty good sports movie. | 4 |
