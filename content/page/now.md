## What Am I Doing These Days?

### Summary:

- exploring various personal projects and things I'd like to be doing. Work/employment is not a priority.
  
### Current Location:
- still living in Quezon City, Philippines. 

### Work

- I still work part-time as a software developer/technical lead/system architect consultant, with the emphasis on part-time. I am very picky with taking on new work, and I usually have very few hours I'm willing to dedicate to any one client, and will usually prefer interesting work. I don't consider work nor full-time employment to be an important part of my identity and it is definitely not a priority. Still, feel free to contact me to discuss any work opportunities, maybe we'll get lucky.

### Others

- I'm working on multiple personal projects, most of which I don't want to talk about. The only public one is this website/blog. I write as often as I can and am constantly trying to update this site to make it better or more to my liking.
- I try not to go out and about Metro Manila too much, as I hate the traffic
- I watch a [lot of TV and movies](/tags/watching-lately)
- I still do [quiz nights](/2013/03/scenes-from-a-quiz-night/), a few times a month
