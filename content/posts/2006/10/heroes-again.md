This series is simple awesome. The writing is excellent, and the fact they&#8217;re using a lot of precognition implies how well the entire series should tie together.

Hiro continues to be the shining star here. Future Hiro&#8217;s appearance promises us several things, namely:

* Hiro will eventually stop being so dorky. And he&#8217;ll get a sword!

* Hiro will eventually learn to speak English well

* Peter will eventually get a scar

* In some future episode, they have to show us what happened to prompt Future Hiro&#8217;s sojourn to the past

TV just keeps getting better. Between Heroes and other series like 24, TV is a lot better to watch than movies now. (Not that I watch the series on TV mind you.)
