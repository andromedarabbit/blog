Mario Kart &#8211; it&'s Mario Kart! Yay! Although we now have six DS owners at the office, we haven&'t yet had time to pull off a six-player race. I&'m pretty sure it will be insane though.

Brain Age &#8211; mildly nerdy, strngely addictive. It&'s not so much a game, more of a series of mental training exercises. Too bad the speaking portion doesn&'t easily recognize my voice (and/or my accent)

Pac Pix &#8211; the sort of innovative game we should be expecting from Nintendo. Draw Pac-man using a stylus to catch the Ghosts. The sort of thing you wouldn&'t be able find on other platforms

Bomberman &#8211; another classic multiplayer game

New Super Mario Bros. &#8211; haven&'t played the main game much, but has a bunch of cool minigames that are especially fun multiplayer

Mario and Luigi, Partners in Time &#8211; this is the one I&'m currently playing regularly. Nice Mario-style adventure-RPG. I&'m told it&'s a sequel of sorts to their GBA adventure, but I wouldn&'t know. As far as I can tell, the only action in the game is &#8220;jump&#8221;!
