A friend of mine at work once commented to me that I ask the silliest questions.

When I&#8217;m a bit bored at the office, I will sometimes throw random meaning-of-life questions at them. things like:

&#8220;If you had a time machine, what would you do with it?&#8221;

&#8220;IF you were president, what would you do about [thing]?&#8221;

&#8220;What&#8217;s your most impossible dream?&#8221;

&#8220;If you could vanish right now, where would you go?&#8221;

&#8220;What kind of superpower would you want to have?&#8221;

I wonder if I really am silly. But these are the sort of things I think about when my mind starts to wander. Are these not things ordinary working people think about? Or is it confined to that small percentage of adults that still have a bit of that childlike dreamer inside their souls?

Well, I really am silly.
