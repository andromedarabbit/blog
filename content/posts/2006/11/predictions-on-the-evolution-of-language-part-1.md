I predict that eventually, &#8220;don&#8217;t&#8221;, &#8220;won&#8217;t&#8221;, &#8220;can&#8217;t&#8221; and the like will eventually become their own words, dropping that weird apostrophe they have.

A few decades after this happens, some people will wonder what &#8220;wan&#8217;t&#8221; used to stand for.
