I think I&#8217;m starting to get the hang of this :p

This whole thing with Kubuntu, where I have to use Adept to install stuff is really weirding out my Windows-geek tendencies.

For today, all I wanted was to get some mp3s playing on Kubuntu. Unfortunately, the default included players (Kaffeine and Amarok) were giving me trouble, claiming they could not play mp3s! I asked around for some help, and read some FAQs, but I kept getting errors trying to download and install gstreamer-mad 0.8.

After a while I gave up and started mucking around in Adept to find an alternative program. I finally settled on installing Beep Mp3 Player, which proceeded to play my mp3 files ðŸ˜€ Yay! I can install stuff! BMP is a bit like Winamp2, so at least I&#8217;m familiar with it. I wonder if there are global hotkeys for it?

Also, now that I was a bit more familiar with Adept, I used it to install Firefox. But the repository only had Firefox 1.0.7! Wazzup with that?

For next time:

&#8211; install Firefox 1.5.x

&#8211; get my screen resolution above 1028&#215;768 (Edit, 20 mins. later: I couldn&#8217;t sleep, so I went ahead and did this. I will probably be late tomorrow. I feel extra geeky now =/)

&#8211; find more stuff to do

I am more of a GNOME person ðŸ˜›

Yeah, you need some plugins.

XMMS is the closest thing you could get to Winamp, btw. You could even use the
  
old skins of WinAmp (Classic skins is the name&#8230; If they have .wsz at the
  
name, rename it to .zip and it would work ðŸ˜‰ Real neat huh?)

Beep and XMMS have no problems playing mp3s out of the box.

I don't really use the GUIfied stuff to play media. mplayer is still the way
  
to go, as far as I am concerned, or EMMS in Emacs ðŸ˜‰ (Which calls other
  
command line tools like mplayer, mpg321, ogg123)

Is that the one you checked? Hmm. What errors have you been getting? You could
  
always log on to #ubuntu or #ubuntu-ph using GAIM or X-chat and ask for help
  
ðŸ˜‰

It's weird that FF1.5 isn't in the universe :(

Update your Ubuntu ok? There's something weird with \[the password thingy\]\[1\].

Enjoy Kubuntu!

I was looking at the screens, and I seemed to like KDE better, don't know why.
  
Hmm&#8230;can I have both, and switch on the fly or something?

I got Amarok to work after awhile&#8230;turned out I was doing something wrong
  
with updating the gstreamer update.

I'll check out XMMS, but I'm really quite impressed with Amarok so far&#8230;it's
  
got some things going for it that Winamp doesn't.

Thanks for the heads up&#8230;luckily, since I'm still just toying around with the
  
ubuntu install, I don't care much if anyone hijacks root or whatnot =p

Whenever I boot into kubuntu, I'm on #kubuntu on freenode&#8230;although #ubuntu-
  
ph sounds better, para Pinoy hehe

Pinoy nga yung #ubuntu-ph. it's the loco channel ðŸ˜‰

Amarok is impressive. I tried it when Mandrake 10.1 OR came out. Astig! May
  
live cd pa nga na basically Amarok talaga yung ffeature ðŸ˜‰ Check it out on
  
distrowatch ðŸ˜€

As for desktop environments. you could opt for which one everytime you login.
  
Everything is just a sudo apt-get install away. I personally recommend XFCE ðŸ˜‰
  
Looks sleek and it's light ðŸ˜€
