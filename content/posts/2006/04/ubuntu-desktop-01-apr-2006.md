I&'m getting a lot more comfortable with Ubuntu&#8230;I spent about half an hour today customizing the environment and setting up some stuff. I can do my downloading in Ubuntu now; I just need to set up some sort of shared FAT32 partition that both WinXP and Ubuntu can access for easy transfer between the two OS. (Currently, Ubuntu only has read-only access to the NTFS file system)

In fact, most of my home PC usage can be done in Ubuntu now, except for one important thing: gaming. I swear, games are the only thing keeping Linux from becoming mainstream; The whole shebang about Linux being hard to use for ordinary folk really isn&'t much when you consider that a lot of ordinary folk ask for help even when using Windows anyway. The default installation of distros like Ubuntu might very well be enough for &#8220;ordinary folk&#8221;&#8230;

But for gamers like me, (even though I&'m not \*that\* hardcore a gamer anymore), unless we&'re willing to satisfy ourselves with a windows emulation layer, we&'ll still need Windows&#8230;
