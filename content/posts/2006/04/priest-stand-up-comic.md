Usually, whenever a Catholic priest gives a homily during Mass, he stands behind a pulpit and generally act like they&#8217;re making a speech.

At the place where I go to Mass, the priests prefer to stand in front of the altar, closer to the audience, holding a microphone in their hands and pacing around a bit during the homily.

I remarked to my brother during the Easter Sunday mass: &#8220;I bet priests would make great stand-up comics.&#8221;

His response: &#8220;That would make an awesome sitcom.&#8221;

Imagine, if you will, a priest at a small parish, occasionally bored with what is surely his life&#8217;s calling. Every so often, he sneaks out to his local comedy club and performs as a stand-up comic. Hilarity ensues.

Too bad it wouldn&#8217;t work in a Philippine setting. (No comedy clubs here&#8230;)

Remember, you read it here first! If it comes out on any network, they&#8217;re surely ripping me off.
