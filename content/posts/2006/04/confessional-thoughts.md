I wonder if the Catholic Church considers piracy as a sin&#8230;at least one that I should be confessing to a priest during er&#8230;confession. If so, I suppose I have more than ten years&#8217; worth of piracy-related sins to confess.

Yeah, I go to confession. Once a year, around the Holy Week period usually. Once a year is the minimum frequency required by the Catholic Church, but I wonder how many observe it?

Many parishes in busy Metro Manila hold a &#8220;Kumpisalang Bayan&#8221; (er&#8230;I&#8217;d say &#8220;Mass Confessional&#8221;, Mass as in lots of people, would be a reasonable translation) around the Holy Week period, where several priests receive confessions from any and all comers. Problem is that there&#8217;s always a queue for each priest. Here&#8217;s a tip: Choose the queue with the least number of old people, especially old women. Old women seem to take the longest time for some reason.

If I were writing a webcomic, one of the characters would go to confession, and the priest would give him an unreasonable penance, something like &#8220;Recite the Our Father ten thousand times&#8221;, and the guy would go like

> <% for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) { %>
  
> Our Father who art in heaven&#8230;&#8221;
  
> <% } %>
