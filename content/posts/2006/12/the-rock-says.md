I was going through the bookstores at yesterday&#8217;s sale day at SM North, hoping to find some bargains. I found a copy of [The Rock][1]&#8216;s book, _The Rock Says _going for the bargain basement price of 50 pesos (roughly 1 US dollar). What a steal!

In case you&#8217;ve been living under, well, a rock, you&#8217;re probably aware that The Rock was one of the most popular, most electrifying men in professional wrestling, lovingly termed &#8220;sports entertainment.&#8221; As a wrestling fan, such a book is a real page-turner for me. It details the story of Rock&#8217;s childhood, his football days in Miami up to his days in the WWE leading up to his historic Wrestlemania XV match with the Rattlesnake, &#8220;Stone Cold&#8221; Steve Austin. As a fan whose view of the wrestling industry has been limited to what I&#8217;ve seen on television, the book gives a good look into the inner workings of the industry. The history, the way things are, the pitfalls, the demons of the wrestling biz are explored by The Rock&#8217;s stories, especially his days of growing up to become a third-generation wrestler.

There are people in the world who don&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; professional wrestling, wondering why others like to watch it when it&#8217;s &#8220;so obviously fake.&#8221; Those people miss the point entirely, and reading &#8220;The Rock Says&#8221; might do give them some insight as to why it&#8217;s called &#8220;Sports Entertainment&#8221; these days. But for wrestling fans, especially those who grew up watching the trade blows with the likes of Mankind and Steve Austin, the book is just one hell of a ride.
