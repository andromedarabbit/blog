Awesome article in The Escapist titled
   
[
    
The Rise and Fall of Troika
   
][1] 
   
, which gives a good view of the problems facing game development studios with regards to production/publisher issues.

I got the link from the
   
[
    
blog at rampantgames.com

which I&#8217;ve been following for a while now. I find the articles about the indie gaming field very enlightening, and I have to say going the route of an indie game developer is much more appealling to me especially after reading about all the issues game dev studios have with big-time publishers.

Am I still thinking about getting into game development? Maybe, but not as much as before. I&#8217;ve come to realize that one of the important reasons I want to make games is because I love

playing

games. So actually, as long as there are good games coming out, I don&#8217;t think about it much. And I suppose I&#8217;m not yet brave enough to embark on such a risky venture for myself, but maybe someday&#8230;
