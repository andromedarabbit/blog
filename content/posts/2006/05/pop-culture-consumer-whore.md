Sometimes it&#8217;s frightening to consider the existent of how much popular culture consumes our time. Most weekends I usually manage to reserve some time for some sort of learning, but over the last 48 hours, aside from work, my time has been swallowed by:

  * Lords and Ladies by Terry Pratchett
  * Episode 21 of Smallville Season 5
  * Episodes 18 and 19 of Simpsons Season 17
  * 8 hours of Suikoden V gameplay
  * &#8230;and probably 2-3 odd hours of watching random cartoons or wrestling on TV

Hmm&#8230;I forgot to watch a movie though. At least I&#8217;m not a complete TV zombie&#8230;I&#8217;m usually either a PC zombie or a PS2 zombie :p
