Previously][1]: I installed Kubuntu, but failed to get the internet working.

But now, since we got a router to service our home network (whereas previously we were using a cross-cable directly connecting two computers), I decided to give it another shot. Apparently, if I have a router between my PC and the DSL line, I can use something called DHCP to automatically configure my ethernet connection. And I did that! Woohoo, and now I&#8217;m posting from Linux!

Now, the question is, what next? I seem to be a total newbie at this Linux thing, I even downloaded Firefox but couldn&#8217;t figure out how to get it running. Oh well, at least there was progress made.
