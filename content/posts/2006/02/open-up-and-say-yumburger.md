Awesome, awesome blog post about some &#8220;Ugly Americans&#8221; and their um&#8230;&#8221;unique&#8221; experience dining at Jollibee. Highlights the world of difference between the American palette and the Filipino one. While they make a good point that Jollibee is the &#8220;crappy burger joint food&#8221; of the Philippines as compared to McDonald&#8217;s which is the &#8220;crappy burger joint food&#8221; of the US, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever heard any Filipino reference Jollibee food in any such disparaging manner.

Of course, I like Jollibee too, which is proof that I am a Filipino. :p I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve eaten McDonald&#8217;s food in more than a year. While there are probably a good number of Americans who hate McDonald&#8217;s food, Jollibee seems to be universally loved, or at least tolerated, by Filipinos.

Whether that says something about the Filipino taste buds, the quality of Jollibee food vis-a-vis McDonald&#8217;s food, or how well the Jollibee marketers understand the patterns of rampant Filipino consumerism is another matter entirely.

Anyway, to paraphrase the best forum response to their post was this: Jollibee is not for you (Americans), it&#8217;s for us (Filipinos).
