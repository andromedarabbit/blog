One of the first things I assume when I have headaches is that, &#8220;Maybe I&#8217;m developing telepathic powers.&#8221; At least, I would assume that people developing telepathic powers have some sort of growing pains that could be misconstrued as headaches. Unfortunately, I still don&#8217;t seem to have such powers and the head pains and dizziness I&#8217;ve been experiencing since Friday were just a sympton of something far more common &#8211; seems I got the flu, known in local parlance asÂ _trangkaso_.

This has not been a particularly good weekend anyway. Since Saturday morning, this computer I have in my room has been flaky, occasionally refusing to boot into either Linux or Windows, and occasionally not even turning on at all. My brother and I suspect a loose video card, and if were just a little less lazier we could easily confirm it by swapping the video card here with the PC in the other room. I threatened to nuke the installation completely and reinstall XP, but once I put the XP installer in the drive, it started working again, imagine that.

Anyway, since I&#8217;m not inclined to waste more time checking it out. If it acts up again, I&#8217;ll probably ask my brother to bring it to a shop. I just wish there were some really good specialist shops that maintain your computer hardware for you. The sort of shop where each customer has a personal file, and when you bring in your machine the guy behind the counter would recognize you and say, &#8220;Hey Mr. Tang, how&#8217;s that new DVD-ROM drive working? Hmm? Faulty memory? Let me take a look&#8230;&#8221; And you&#8217;d know your machine would be in good hands with someone you can trust, a professional who does this sort of thing for a living and not just some anonymous college undergrad trying to make a few bucks.

I still haven&#8217;t seen Superman Returns. I haven&#8217;t been posting lately because of Civ IV&#8230;that game is addictive, and I hear an expansion is coming out. I&#8217;ve beaten Prince level now, yay!
