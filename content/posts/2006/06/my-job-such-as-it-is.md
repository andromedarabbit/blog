Nice post onÂ [Salary Averages Comparison][1] over at the Pinoy Tech Blog. It got me thinking about my own job. I work at a foreign-based software development company that caters to clients outside the country. These days, I work mostly on JSP-based web projects. My starting salary, three and a half years ago, was higher than the average presented in this graph. Obviously, I&#8217;m earning a lot more than that now. I always assumed I was earning more than average; it feels nice to have it confirmed by some data, even if from across the internets.

Before I started out in the current job, I wouldn&#8217;t have thought it likely that I would stay as long as have. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I enjoy what I do as a software developer; I&#8217;ve never been close to humble, so I don&#8217;t mind saying I&#8217;m pretty good at what I do as well. But I&#8217;m the sort of guy who always dreams of walking his own way, not just being a regular joe employee like everyone else. Such that every so often I get this craving to jump ship and search for a different fortune.

Not that it&#8217;s a bad job mind you. Just the opposite in fact, above average pay and work I enjoy doing (most of the time). Sure, it gets stressful at times; especially since I&#8217;m currently serving as technical lead on one of the larger projects, such that I often get overwhelmed by technical requests. But somehow I&#8217;ve grown used to it here. For lack of a better term, I&#8217;ve grown some roots.

And yesterday, I was promoted. I haven&#8217;t been briefed on the details yet, but I know from others that it&#8217;s not a salary increase thing, more of additional benefits. Still, it&#8217;s good to be recognized, even if I was expecting it (people were kidding me for months that I was already past due for it&#8230;) Even though I was expecting it, I still failed to gather my usual wordiness and basically stammered a couple of thank you&#8217;s as my speech. Hey, I didn&#8217;t expect to have to talk to two hundred people!

Man, now it&#8217;s gonna be even harder to resign&#8230;
