As a developer who regularly talks with users, I believe it is our
  
responsibility to help users express what they want. This is not just about
  
writing specs and having them sign it.

It is also an issue of expections. Developers sometimes (or oftentimes?)
  
assume that users know the capabilities and limitations of a program and that
  
these things should not be discussed with the users.

We also need to be creative in helping users understand what we are trying to
  
build. Instead of writing a spec, use screen prototypes. Instead of using
  
PowerPoint to describe what the application can do, conduct a demo. Let the
  
users play with the program and observe them.
