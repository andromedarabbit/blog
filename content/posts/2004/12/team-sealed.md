Team Sealed a couple of weekends back. For the uninitiated, ChK is a Magic:the Gathering set, and Team Sealed is our favorite limited format! I think it&#8217;s mostly because if we lose, I can blame my teammates for screwing up, unlike in regular tournaments where it really is my fault. :p And if we win? Free cards!

Of course, we didn&#8217;t win. I&#8217;d like to say it was primarily because of a bad set of cards we got (I think we were the only team that didn&#8217;t get a Honden or two&#8230;), but we really made a lot of mistakes. Of well, it was a learning experience. An expensive one.
