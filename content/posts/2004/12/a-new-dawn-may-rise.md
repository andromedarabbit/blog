A new hand has been dealt, the game has changed but the stakes remain the same. Fate tempts me with its&' winds of change, and what once was thought lost forever may once again be within reach. This time I tread carefully however, as my recklessness may once again be the bane of my quest. Hold my hands close to my chest, bide my time, and see what the fates have in store for our hero&#8230;

but I'm hoping that's good news.
