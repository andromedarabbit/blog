I suppose everyone and their mother has had a chance to voice their opinions on Spiderman 2 by now, so here&#8217;s mine: Some parts are hokey, some parts are cheesy, some parts are gratuitous Hollywood crap, it has quite a few inconsistencies and plot holes but overall, it&#8217;s a hell of a ride, and I found it considerably more &#8216;fun&#8217; than the first one. That being said, I&#8217;m not entirely excited about the Goblin making an obvious comeback in Spiderman 3, but the only other Spidey nemesis worthy of being in a movie would be Venom&#8230;and bringing alien symbiotes in the equation would completely change the feel of the movies.
