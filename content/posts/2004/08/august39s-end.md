It's been a while, I got a lot to say, some personal things, some random stuff from the internet. Let's start with the easy stuff, random linkage:

  * First up, the [Kingdom of Loathing][1], it's an online Stickman RPG! It's MMO (well, not really massive), it's wacky, and you can be a pastamancer! It currently amuses me&#8230;and I hate waiting to get more turns! My account there is &#8220;hungry roy&#8221;
  * It's [Quentin Tarantino's diary][2]! Or is it? You be the judge!
  * I was bored, and wanted something to happen with this blog, so I decided to submit it to [Rice Bowl Journals][3]&#8230;it's some sort of community for webloggers of Asian descent. I'm of Asian descent, right?
  * I have some gmail invites. Ask me for one if you're interested, even if I don't know you, for some reason (maybe I'll talk about it in the next post, even), I feel like making friends. (Where to ask? Try the comments.)
