&#8220;Life-changing events&#8221;&#8230;one would think I&#8217;m about to speak of something like a natural disaster, getting married or quitting my job, something that would create a profound change in my life.

No, I&#8217;m going to talk about something a bit less dramatic, but it has had a profound effect on me nonetheless. I don&#8217;t talk about these things that often, but hey, what use is a blog if you can&#8217;t use it as an outlet, right?

I&#8217;m in love. Yup, I am. Whereas I previously considered myself as someone strong enough to be emotionally independent from other people, I find myself now thinking about a certain person constantly, worried about how she is, having my mood depend on how she interacts with me, and generally acting quite nervously around her. I won&#8217;t mention her name, but I will say I&#8217;ve known her for a bit of time now, and it took me a while to reconcile the desires of my heart and the objections of my mind; but today I am sure: I love her.

This sort of thing is really not my style, I normally don&#8217;t like to speak of romantic ideals or anything, so I&#8217;ll cut to the chase. She knows, I told her. And her response? Well, it was less than what I wanted, but more than I expected. In her own words: &#8220;I&#8217;m not closing any doors on you, but I&#8217;m not leaving any windows open either.&#8221; She wants us to be friends, she doesn&#8217;t want me to court her, she says if she feels something for me somewhere along the way, then that&#8217;s it; if not, then too bad.

Now, I&#8217;m generally stupid about this sort of thing myself, so to be honest, I have no idea how to proceed. I want to pursue something with her, but for now, I really have no choice but to settle for building a friendship and hope that fate gives me a chance some day. (It seems I have a tendency to rely on fate for such things&#8230;)

I guess the main reason I&#8217;m blogging this is that I realize it&#8217;s brought about a change in my life&#8230;and I want to remember it. I want to remember that this is the time I changed, and that she was the reason why.

How did I change? For one thing, I seem to have gotten back a whole lot friendlier, and also a whole lot moodier. She brought out my gloomy side again &#8211; the side of me that&#8217;s logical and analytical. He seldom needs to come out because I can usually rely on my normal self to handle things. But this whole issue with her &#8212; I have no idea how to handle it, so gloomy side comes out. Except he has no idea what to do either. It isn&#8217;t exactly a problem well-suited to logical analysis, and it frustrates me so much that something I feel so strongly about could be so out of my control.

Two things have happened as a result of this, basically: one, I&#8217;m more open to people now; and two, I spent some time thinking about love and life, and my life in general, where I want to go and what I want to do. I think I learned a lot about myself; maybe I&#8217;ll write about it one of these days.

For now, I just want to remember that she is the reason I&#8217;m feeling this way&#8230;
