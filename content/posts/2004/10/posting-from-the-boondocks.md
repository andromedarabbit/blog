Well, not really, seeing as how there aren&#8217;t really any mountains anywhere near here. I&#8217;m in Daet, Camarines Norte, if that means anything to you. It&#8217;s great to be back here &#8212; apparently the last time I was here was in 1996.

Some things have changed, but mostly things are still the same. There&#8217;s some sort of minimall now, and a Shakey&#8217;s, and a Jollibee. ðŸ˜› And there&#8217;s internet! I&#8217;m posting right now from a dingy internet cafe near my grandmother&#8217;s house. The mouse is horrible, and I had to put up with using IE for a while. I got fed up quickly though, and just went ahead and downloaded and installedÂ [FirefoxÂ ][1]on two of their machines. Hehe, I&#8217;ll leave them open when I leave, hopefully I can convert someone. ðŸ˜€

I&#8217;m actually here out of necessity &#8211; work necessity that is. I forgot to pass a couple of fspecs before I had to run for the bus yesterday, so I whipped up some quick specs here and sent em over to China. That&#8217;s the beauty of the internet age, I guess. I can pick up my work whenever I want, and be working with people from 3 different countries while waking up late in some desolate corner of a third-world country. ðŸ˜€

I like it here in Daet, despite the lack of some modern conveniences. (The toilet here does not flush&#8230;I have to get a bucket of water and flush stuff myself.) Ironically, I was just lying around sleeping and reading the Cryptonomicon the whole morning. Ironic, because when I was a kid, I seem to recall that I didn&#8217;t particularly like coming here, &#8216;coz I&#8217;d be all bored out of my wits. This time though, I actually did come here to bum around. ðŸ˜€
