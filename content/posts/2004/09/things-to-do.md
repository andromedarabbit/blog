In order of priority:
 
  


  * **
     
    Study for the JITSE
    
** 
    
    &#8211; I&#8217;m terrible at this. Frankly, it&#8217;s quite boring to study, and it reminds me why I&#8217;m not taking any post-graduate studies. By all accounts, I&#8217;ll probably be cramming those last few days before the exam, as usual. It doesn&#8217;t help that some of my coworkers convinced me to tag along for a trip to Fontana 7 days before the exam proper. I may have to rely on SHEER GENIUS again.

    Study PHP, build a new website
    
** 
    
    &#8211; I&#8217;ve been making websites for years now, but now I want to try my hand at starting and maintaining a dynamic data-driven website. I&#8217;d use JSP (since that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m familar with from work), but it seems that PHP is the popular thing on web hosts, so I&#8217;ll just spend some time to learn it. (Just keep on learning, heh)

    Master Street Fighter III: Third Strike
    
** 
    
    &#8211; well, not quite master, since I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever be able to master 360s/720s, but at least to know the game as well as I knew SFA3 and CVS2. I think it&#8217;s an important indication of my priorities in life that a video game ranks third, next to learning. ðŸ˜›

    Get Cheese fixed
    
** 
    
    &#8211; Cheese is, of course, the other computer, that&#8217;s been busted for months now. &#8220;System failed memory check&#8221;, apparently. I know, I should just buy some new RAM and try it out, but I&#8217;ve burnt so much money replacing parts for that PC that I&#8217;m uber-cautious; I want to be sure what&#8217;s wrong with it before doing anything. I need to find some free time to take the thing to a shop. 
  * **
     
    Buy a cellphone
    
** 
    
    &#8211; Apparently, I am now the last Filipino to not have a cellphone; the main problem is that I want a phone that I won&#8217;t be bored with in a few days, so I&#8217;ll probably need a smartphone of some sort, but that conflicts with the other problem: I&#8217;m hella cheap.

    Catch up on Reading
    
** 
    
    &#8211; currently: Cryptonomicon. Enqueued: The Alchemist, American Gods. I have a feeling I won&#8217;t be doing much reading &#8217;til after the JITSE though. 


   
Hmm&#8230;that&#8217;s it for now.
