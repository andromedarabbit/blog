Something random found today:
  
[
  
Some guy&'s gallery of comic-book (and other genre) characters as lego people

And, for those three people who haven&'t seen this before:

The Fight Crime!
  
][2] 

The guy who made the above javascript thingy (website: [black-ink.org][3]) had a link to some sort of [online &#8216;zine about comics][4]. I don&'t follow comics much anymore, but apparently, [Peter David is writing something X-Factor again.
  
][5] 
  
And according to a friend of mine, he&'s also writing Hulk again! Now if only I had the money and patience to start collecting comics again&#8230;
