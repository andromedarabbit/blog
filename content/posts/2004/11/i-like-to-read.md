Really. I&#8217;ll read most anything. Books, comics, magazines, newspapers, leaflets, articles, essays. Well, anything well-written at least. When I first got access to the Internet, I was overjoyed. &#8220;Wow! Lots of stuff to read!&#8221; And I read a lot online. I started mostly with anime fanfiction, but pretty soon I enjoyed reading discussions on mailing-lists, message boards, news sites, etc. The internet is a treasure trove for one who always strives for information. But I digress, this post is not about the wondrous internet.

It&#8217;s about the fact that I like to read. In particular, I like to read books. In fact, I thought about posting something like this because I was looking for a particular book. Specifically, _the Wastelands_, third book of Stephen King&#8217;s Dark Tower series. And I don&#8217;t want just any copy, I want a copy in the same series as the first two books I already have. I&#8217;ve looked through several National Bookstore branches already, but have yet to find one. I know they used to have a copy at the SM North Edsa branch, since that&#8217;s where I bought the second book _Drawing of the Three_. However, I can&#8217;t find it there; it seems that branch is under renovation, maybe I&#8217;m just too confused at the change in layout. The salespeople don&#8217;t seem to be much help either. &#8220;Stephen King? Try the horror section.&#8221; That would be great except Dark Tower is not a horror series!

But I digress again. Back to the topic. I like to read. I like to read books. The internet sort of changed that. After I first got internet access, I seldom read books for a period of time, meaning most of my college years. In fact, I think the only series of books I was able to follow during my college years was Robert Jordan&#8217;s Wheel of Time series. (Short review? Started out okay, then got silly, then got annoying. Serious milking cow.)

After I started working, I had a source of income. (Wow, what a deep and non-obvious statement!) Given this, I was able to start reading again, not only by borrowing from friends (Hi Dave, Mike!), but this time I was able to buy the occasional book myself. So I&#8217;ve been trying to catch up. Sadly, I think the years of reading lots of stuff online has tarnished my reading skills. I still read far, far quicker than most people, but it takes me ages to finish a single book. nowadays. I&#8217;m currently reading Neil Gaiman&#8217;s American Gods; I started about a week agao, but I&#8217;m not even a fifth of the way in! It&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s a bad book, it&#8217;s okay, in Gaiman&#8217;s usual way, but I think it&#8217;s because there are a lot more distractions in my life nowadays (work, love or lack of it, video games, blogging); When I was young I was able to read a lot because whenever I had free time I would curl up with a good book. These days however, I find that whatever free time I have, I prefer to spend it in quiet _muni-muni _instead of having to use my brainpower to go through a potentially difficult book (thanks, Cryptonomicon!)

I also want to read more non-fiction, autobiographies and stuff. But I find that such books are usually more expensive than normal paperback novels, and I don&#8217;t know who I can borrow such from.

Anyway, what&#8217;s the point of this post? I like to read. And I want to read more. That is all.
