Literally translated as &#8220;I dare you to touch his ear&#8221;, the phrase is commonly used by elementary school boys prior to starting a fight. It&#8217;s similar to the more well-known Western scenario where one boy draws a line across the sand and goes &#8220;I dare you to cross this line&#8221; This phrase came to me today because we were talking to two girls (well okay, ladies) at work today and they weren&#8217;t familiar with the phrase or it&#8217;s usage. I of course proceeded to demonstrate by flicking my co-worker&#8217;s ear. After which, all hell broke loose. Or not.
