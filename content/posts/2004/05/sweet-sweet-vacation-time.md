God, it feels good to be goofing off. After having to spend six days in HK (well, more like five-and-a-half, more on that later) and then proceeding to conduct SQL training sessions for the latest batch of recruits, I was kinda tired and stressed out from work. Good thing I had the common sense to file for two days leave after the elections last Monday; don&#8217;t have to come in &#8217;til tomorrow.

Not that I&#8217;m using the free time for anything sensible mind you. In fact, most people would probably consider it a serious waste of vacation leave. But hey, I like to goof off! In between [Warcraft III ][1]sessions, random internet surfing, constant reloading of the [Inquirer website ][2](to see the latest Namfrel quick-count figures of course), and reading through a couple of CDs worth of comics copied from Mon last Monday, I did manage to clean up my room somewhat.

I really only wanted to clean up &#8216;coz I wanted to read the Street Fighter comics and couldn&#8217;t find them. I was only able to find the two most recent issues though. One other thing I wanted to do was to seriously clean up the crap on this computer. We&#8217;re quite low on disk space, and more than half of my desktop is cluttered with icons, and Alvin tells me we have far too many MP3s on disk.

I&#8217;ve downloaded some Java code that will help me extract ID3 data from MP3 files. I&#8217;m hoping to use it to properly catalog all the MP3s on disk, assuming I get unlazy enough.

Heh, while I was Mon&#8217;s place, he made the brilliant observation that practically everything we do is fueled by how lazy (or unlazy) we are at any time&#8230;
