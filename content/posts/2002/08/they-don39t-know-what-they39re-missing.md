I&#8217;m pissed off.

Today I went to Ortigas for a job interview with a nameless IT company where my cousin Rachel works. I was quite optimistic too &#8212; the position was for a &#8220;Java Trainee.&#8221; I was more than willing to be trained, and a trainee position meant you didn&#8217;t have to be proficient in Java right? Turns out I was wrong. =( Apparently they needed someone with some experience in Java, preferably with a project or two under his belt. I tried to convince the interviewer that I had a lot of raw talent and learn pretty fast anyway, but I haven&#8217;t got any high hopes. That pissed me off.

Even worse, I had gone to Ortigas with just enough cash to make the trip back and forth. I had left a good two hundred bucks at home &#8216;coz I forgot to pick &#8217;em up and put &#8217;em in my wallet. I was thinking of trying out the arcade version of Capcom vs SNK 2, maybe buying a CD or two. But no! Now I couldn&#8217;t even grab a bite on the way home. That pissed me off.

Later that night, my mother was watching &#8220;While You Were Sleeping&#8221;, and I was feeling so depressed I was wondering what would happen if I ended up like Sandra Bullock at the start of the movie &#8212; alone, and working a dead end job as a ticket seller. Sigh

It&#8217;s not just the fact that I&#8217;m still unemployed &#8212; it&#8217;s been a good nine months now and I&#8217;ve kinda gotten used to that. It&#8217;s the realization that despite whatever work I&#8217;ve done in school, I can&#8217;t get a job. It&#8217;s as if everything I learned in college was useless.

When I was finishing up in UP, everything seemed simple &#8212; I&#8217;d graduate and all my troubles would be over. I&#8217;d get a job at maybe Canon or Intel, save a bit, buy a new computer and a PS2, et cetera. To tell the truth I was probably spoiled by those teachers that kept telling us that simply being graduates of the State University was good enough to land a job. I ought to sue those teachers for mental anguish or something. I graduated from one of the hardest course at one of the best universities in the country, and I can&#8217;t land a job. Gosh darn it all.

After thinking about this, I thought I&#8217;d evaluate my own skills to see what could be done. Lemme see, I can do:

  * Embedded software. Since I did two thesis-level projects involving embedded software, I reckon I&#8217;m fairly good at this. The problem is that I&#8217;ve only come across one job opportunity where this skill would be useful, and I never got a callback (and
  
    I thought it was a pretty good job for me too.)
  * Programming. This would be great, until I acknowledge that while I&#8217;m a programming genius, I don&#8217;t actually have any application-level programming experience under my belt. I&#8217;m good a coding, optimizing programs, finding solutions to tough problems, but I&#8217;ve never been part of a large-scale software project, even though I could probably do it all myself, in theory.
  * Web Development. I know HTML and various scripting languages, can use Macromedia Dreamweaver and Flash, what can&#8217;t I do? The problem comes up again: I know it all in theory, but lack the experience. It&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m churning out webpages at a dime a
  
    dozen, and most places looking for web developers ask for some level of experience. Curses.
  * Write. Or at least I like to think I can. But it doesn&#8217;t sound very profitable to be writing for a living&#8230;

Sigh, that&#8217;s it. Pretty sad, huh? The main problem seems to be most of what I can do is self-taught and relies on my raw talent instead of actual experience. What is it with the world? Why can&#8217;t they just recognize my genius and overlook my lack of experience? I learn impossibly fast anyway, anything I don&#8217;t know I can pick up quickly. Argh.

Oh well, at least now I feel better, having put my thoughts into words. This journal thing is probably really healthy for me. I get to whine without burdening anyone with my problems.

There&#8217;s still some hope, at least. Sir Louie, the ECE guy Tito Ferry set me up with, said he&#8217;d ask around, although he did recommend I learn a few more skills by taking some short courses at APC, an IT school near SM North. I&#8217;m a bit hesistant about that though &#8212; short courses will undoubtedly cost money, and I don&#8217;t want to bother my parents about cash any more than I have to. It&#8217;s bad enough I can&#8217;t help them make ends meet&#8230;

Anything else? Lately we&#8217;ve been watching Excel Saga (ridiculosuly funny! Pedro!!!) and Scryed. AXN is showing two new anime series: Ayashi no Ceres and Gensomaden Saiyuki. And they brought back Monday night anime, so more anime all around. Oh yeah, the A/V cable for our PSX is apparently busted. Which probably explains why I got rather pissed off today. Just when I was gonna get adult Rei back into the party! Without the PSX to distract me, I had no choice but to face my real-world problems

=(

In any case, I guess I have no choice but to keep going and hope for the best. I got a nice quote today from _Castaway_, from Tom Hanks of all people:

Hi I'm pika. I'm searching the web when I stumble to this blog thing you have
  
here and your article seems to be quite intriguing. Because when I get to read
  
this, I felt that history repeats its self. It is not that exact though but we
  
have quite a similar case.

If you have time, kindly reply to my email <pikapika2501@yahoo.com> because I
  
have alot of questions and I wanted to share my experience to you.

And one of my question would be, what's your job right now and how are you?
  
LOL, I wanted to know what happen to people having this pissing off
  
experience.

Thank you very much.
