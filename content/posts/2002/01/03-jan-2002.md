Changed the layout even more! Added a start page containing the menu only, so that visitors wouldn&#8217;t have to listen to me ranting all the time. Uploaded some stuff, since my COMPUTER IS PROBABLY GOING TO DIE SOON! It&#8217;s on its last legs&#8230;I can feel it. Over the next couple of days I&#8217;ll probably be uploading stuff that I don&#8217;t have backed up elsewhere. For now the only new upload is a bunch of high school pics. See the Files section for more.

Towards my resolutions:

* I went on over to FF.net to see if the last fic ([Nobody Wants to Live Forever][1]) got any reviews. Whee! Got some positive ones. I&#8217;ll try to write more soon.

* I downloaded a free Win32 C++ compiler+GUI. It&#8217;s Dev-C++, available at [
  
Bloodshed Software][2]. Also, I downloaded some of the old Win32 programming lessons from ReliSoft. I&#8217;ll probably redo all the work since my previous trials had been lost in an HD formatting a while back. The sad thing is that the DirectX SDKs are unbelievably huge, 100+ Megs, even the older DX5.0, so I probably won&#8217;t be doing any DX programming &#8217;til I get a new computer.

* Learning Japanese? Well&#8230;I&#8217;m working on it I guess. I checked out some lessons at [Japanese-Online.com][3]. I&#8217;ve gone through them before, but I didn&#8217;t really follow through so I forgot. =)

Anything else? Okay:

* Turns out another Square SNES game has been gifted with a translation patch! The game is Live-a-Live, a strange sort of RPG. I tried it out a bit, but now I&#8217;m stuck. =( It&#8217;s really weird. Hulk Hogan appears in it! Except that he&#8217;s named MaxBomber or something.
