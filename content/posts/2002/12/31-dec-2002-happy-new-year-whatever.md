  * Well, trying to make this a weekly format thing obviously fizzled out.
  
    What with me starting work on Friday, I just give up. I&#8217;ll keep this site
  
    up and put up stuff of interest whenever I feel like it, just like before. 
  * So what&#8217;s new? As I said, work starts Friday. I went to an orientation
  
    for the job last Friday and it seems like a tough and demanding job, but
  
    I rise to the challenge in any case. What I&#8217;m worried about is that the
  
    hour and a half commute might sap my energy too much. Maybe I should carry
  
    chcocolates to work. ðŸ˜›
  * We got a PS2&#8230;in fact most of my free time these past couple of weeks
  
    have been sapped by two huge beasts named Suikoden III and Fallout 2.
  
    Actually, I haven&#8217;t touched Fallout 2 in a week or so because of Suiko3.
  * For the New Year I resolve to give up on resolutions, they never work
  
    anyway.
  * Later.
