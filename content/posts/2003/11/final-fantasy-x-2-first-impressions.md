I&#8221;m about two or three hours into it. I like it. But then again, I like anything with a job system and learnable abilities. I find myself excited at the prospect of learning abilities with weird names such as &#8220;Cheap Shot&#8221;, &#8220;Initiative&#8221;, &#8220;Flametongue&#8221; and &#8220;Silent Samba&#8221;!

The game itself has a very &#8220;happy&#8221; feel&#8230;the battles are fast-paced and the general mood is upbeat. If you came in looking for a Final Fantasy game, you&#8217;re gonna be disappointed. The Final Fantasy victory music isn&#8217;t even there; Yuna jumps across chasms and climbs up ledges at the touch of a button.

The battles can be somewhat confusing, given how fast the ATB goes. And between the third and fourth missions (Besaid and Zanarkand), the difficulty seemed to jump up quite a bit. (I actually ran out of MP in Zanarkand and had to skip back to the save point for a refill.). Hopefully it means the rest of the game won&#8217;t be a walk in the park like some other Final Fantasy games \*\*coughcoughFF8coughcough\*\*

It was nice seeing Wakka and Lulu, but I was really glad to see the Besaid Aurochs again.! ðŸ˜› I remember people complaining about the skimpy clothing and how Rikku is portrayed as a sex object. I don&#8217;t get that feeling, in fact I don&#8217;t particularly like the Rikku look, but Yuna looks pretty good.

About the jumping and climbing part&#8230;it&#8217;s kinda weird seeing it in a Final Fantasy game, but I hope they find some clever gameplay uses for it (none so far) The garment grid/dresssphere thing seemed kind of lame, and I&#8217;m not particularly fond of the Sailormoon-type costume changing thing, but it&#8217;s okay, I suppose. I&#8217;d turn off the long animations in the options, but I suppose I have to see each change once&#8230;

And for those who were worried about Yuna being a pop star&#8230;she&#8217;s not. ^_^
