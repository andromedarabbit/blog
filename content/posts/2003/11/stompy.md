I&'m alive, I think.

Last Saturday, I helped an old man cross a very dangerous street! This may seem a weird thing to report, but it felt unusual enough to be helping a complete stranger. I&'m not saying I don&'t normally help complete strangers, but I rarely see people helping old people cross the street!

I&'m thinking of getting a domain name and paid webhosting&#8230;there&'sÂ [
  
this host that&'s cheap and local][1]&#8230;. The main reason is I want to learn a web-based scripting language, maybe PHP. This is actually a no-brainer, as it&'s the cheapest of the things I&'m thinking of getting&#8230;(new TV, new PC, DSL, new cellphone&#8230;), but not yet, maybe by January&#8230;

_All that is gold does not glitter</p> 

Not all those who wander are lost

The old that is strong does not wither

Deep roots are not touched by the frost

From the shadows a light shall be woken

From the ashes a fire shall spring

Renewed shall be blade that was broken

The crownless again shall be king

&#8212; Strider, Lord of the Rings
