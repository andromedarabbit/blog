I got it same time as FFX-2. However, I can&#8217;t get it to run&#8230;when I choose &#8220;Game&#8221; from the launcher, I just get the little spinning disc cursor for a while, then nothing. I&#8217;ve tried most of the stuff found in the accompanying troubleshooting doc, and I&#8217;ve sent Lucasarts a plea for help, but no response so far. Any help?

Actually I had the same problem with Neverwinter Nights when I first got it, and I was able to work that out by downloading the most recent patch. I&#8217;m guessing I&#8217;ll need to wait for a KOTOR patch before I can play it. Oh well, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m running out of things to play&#8230;
