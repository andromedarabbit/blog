Whee&#8230;holiday. For those not from the Philippines, All Saints Day and All Souls Day are non-working holidays for us, and the roads are generally jammed anywhere near cemeteries as Filipinos flock to the graveyards to remember their deceased loved ones. Sadly, since my folks are out of town, and I have no idea how to get to the resting place of my grandparents without them, all I can do is say a prayer for them right here. \*says a silent prayer\*

Anyway, I bought Temple of Elemental Evil today. I hear it&#8217;s quite buggy though &#8212; I&#8217;ll wait for a patch before actually playing it. But installing the game allowed me to make a discovery&#8230;I&#8217;m low on hard disk space! I&#8217;m not sure how it happened, since I believe that a week ago I still had some 15 or more gigs of space available, but earlier I was down to 2 Gb. A quick scan told me that there was no disk error involved &#8212; so I decided to chuck some stuff from the PC. Out went Baldur&#8217;s Gate (I like the game, but I really can&#8217;t seem to get myself to play it very often) and Neverwinter Nights (yes, it&#8217;s infinitely replayable given the available modules, but why play mods when there are new full-length games like ToEE available?) After uninstalling these games and getting rid of some old Naruto eps, I was back up to a still-tight-but-healthy 6 gigs.

Well, checking out the disk space led to other stuff, so now I&#8217;m resigned to spending the rest of the night cleaning up the stuff on the computer, installing new programs, getting rid of old ones, and lots of other general maintenance work.

Chances are I&#8217;ll be goofing again in a while though. Just like now&#8230;
