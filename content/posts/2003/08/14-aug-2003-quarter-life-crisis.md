* Well, not exactly. But I am now 25, in any case. Looking back, there are many
  
    things I might have regretted, but my life philosphy tells me that there can be
  
    no regrets. The past is past, and the future is yet to come. Somehow, I&#8217;m only
  
    a few steps closer towards achieving my lifetime goals, but my gut tells me to
  
    keep on dreaming. Such is the folly of a dreamer.
  * In case you&#8217;re wondering, my lifetime goals include becoming an accomplished
  
    indie game developer, and world domination. There are more, but these are the
  
    ones that are most constant. Yes, I&#8217;m serious about the world domination part!
  * Anyway, I&#8217;m glad I finally got some free time. Work&#8217;s been a bitch lately,
  
    but I had to call in sick today due to an unfortunate (or fortunate?) case of LBM.
  
    Filipinos in the audience know what I&#8217;m talking about. Truth be told I would&#8217;ve
  
    taken the slightest excuse to get off work. It&#8217;s better to be absent
  
    today since the workload is rather light while we&#8217;re waiting for the UAT results,
  
    rather than being absent when we have to cram for deadlines. Gee, I wonder if my
  
    officemates are reading this. ^_^
