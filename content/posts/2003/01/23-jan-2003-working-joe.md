How&#8217;s work you ask? It&#8217;s going pretty well actually. Everything&#8217;s still easy-peasy for me as I&#8217;m undergoing some training and stuff. I&#8217;m a bit worried about what happens after the training though, from the looks of it people put in a lot of overtime here. üôÅ The best thing about the job is that I&#8217;m learning a lot of stuff. In two weeks I learned SQL, PL/SQL and Delphi. Starting tomorrow I&#8217;m gonna be training on Oracle Developer. The work itself looks easy enough &#8212; nothing I can&#8217;t handle. Since most of the coding is done using high-level RAD Tools, I should be fine. On a side note, it&#8217;s a weird feeling actually having access to money. It&#8217;s like everything looks different because there&#8217;s always the possibility of buying stuff. On another side note, I&#8217;m paying a lot in taxes. My annual salary is like a couple of ten thousand above the minimum for my bracket. It&#8217;s irritating.
