* I installed Civilization III, and told myself, &#8220;Gee, I guess
  
    I&#8217;ll try it out for an hour or so.&#8221; I didn&#8217;t stop for six hours.
  
    So much for getting anything done over the weekend.
  * Luckily (or not), my being awake those six hours of early morning
  
    allowed me to catch some late-breaking news. Apparently, disgruntled
  
    young officers of the not-so-prestigious Armed Forces of the Philippines
  
    had taken control of some building in Makati, laying bombs and stuff
  
    around and with snipers on the roof and all. Not sure, what&#8217;s going
  
    on, but hey, at least it&#8217;s never boring in good old RP.
  * There seem to be quite a number of broken links around here.
  
    I&#8217;ll get around to fixing them soon. Maybe.
  * Curses, I ate up my quota of email bandwidth from
  
    [Softhome][1] again. Now I have to wait
  
    &#8217;til August before I can check that address again.
  * Apparently, this website is now named &#8220;roywantsmeat&#8221;, after my
  
    battle.net account. If I ever get a domain name, that&#8217;s what I would
  
    use. [roywantsmeat.com][2]!
