Yesterday, at around 6 PM, as I was winding up the day&'s work, we received a request from the user that they wanted some maintenance work done on one of the more obscure programs. And they needed it the next day! And we still had to have a meeting (we had originally scheduled the meeting for 3:00PM but had to keep pushing it due to stuff coming up) I wanted to reach out across the internet and slap whoever made the maintenance request on the head. End result: Most of us went home a bit before 12, the meeting never pushed through, and I called in for half-day sick leave today because of a freakin&' headache.
