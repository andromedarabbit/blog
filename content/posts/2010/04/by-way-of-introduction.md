I&#8217;m a long-time Magic player from the Philippines. I used to blog at [my personal website][1], but I had this domain so I just decided to use it.

My magic blogging used to consist mostly of tournament reports (I like to play both limited and constructed). For this blog, I&#8217;d like to write more design/card analysis and about events in the Magic community. Most of online Magic community writing is geared towards an American/western audience, so I&#8217;d also like to write stuff relevant to the Asian magic scene if I get the chance.

Enjoy!
