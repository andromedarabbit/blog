For President, I&#8217;m voting **Dick Gordon**, because I believe that the Philippines should be a meritocracy where people are chosen as leaders based on the strength of their accomplishments and qualifications.

For Vice President, I&#8217;m voting for **Mar Roxas**, as he&#8217;s simply the most qualified and with the strongest history of government service. The E-VAT thing is actually a plus for him, as it shows he has the capacity to make difficult decisions if needed.

For Senators:

**Sonia Roco:** I believe she will live up to the advocacies espoused by her husband the late Raul Roco (whom I voted for in 2004). Focus: Education.

**Risa Hontiveros:** A solid history of advocacy and support for pro-people legislation during her two terms as AKBAYAN party-list representative. Focus: Healthcare, Women&#8217;s Rights

**Neric Acosta:** Former teacher and three-term congressman of Bukidon, with legislative history focusing on environmental concerns. Focus: Environment

**Martin Bautista:** A successful doctor in the US, decided to come back to the Philippines to offer to serve the country. Focus: Healthcare, including reproductive health

**Alex Lacson:** I have to admit, I&#8217;m only voting for him because of his book &#8220;12 Little Things A Pinoy Can Do To Help His Country.&#8221; I&#8217;m a sucker for anyone who is able to point out to Filipinos that change has to start with ourselves, even with little things. It&#8217;s good to have new faces in the Senate instead of just the same old trapos. Focus: education, employment.

**Adel Tamano:** Originally I wanted to avoid voting for any NP candidates, given how ticked off I am by MV. But unlike the presidential race which is all-or-nothing, I prefer giving other parties some space in the senatorial race so that the Senate won&#8217;t be a rubber stamp of the administration. Tamano is a good choice, he&#8217;s another former educator (was head of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila) and adds representation for Mindanao

**Pia Cayetano:** The only other NP senator I&#8217;m voting for. Her advocacies include health, education, environment, youth and women&#8217;s empowerment.

**Miriam Santiago:** A lot of people don&#8217;t like Miriam for various reasons (_luka-luka, madaldal_ were some of the reasons people cited), but I&#8217;m not the sort of person to dismiss someone just because she doesn&#8217;t follow social conventions. Miriam has been around a while and doesn&#8217;t take any BS from anybody. Her presence in the Senate will keep people honest because she likes to call a spade a spade. At the very least, it will keep the Senate interesting. Focus: ???

I&#8217;m stopping at eight senators for now. None of the others particularly appeal to me.

For Mayor/Vice Mayor of Quezon City, I&#8217;m going with **Bautista/Belmonte**, mostly because I trust that Sonny Belmonte wouldn&#8217;t choose idiots to take over after his well-respected term as mayor.

For Congressman and District councilors, I&#8217;m abstaining. I don&#8217;t know who the candidates are, and even worse, I&#8217;m voting in a different district than where I&#8217;m currently residing, I have no right to decide the fate of district 3.

For party-list, I choose **AGHAM** party list (same one I voted for last time). It&#8217;s sad that they are supporting Villar, but I&#8217;ll just overlook that since I&#8217;m strongly leaning towards their Science and Technology advocacy. S&T; isn&#8217;t usually a concern of ordinary Filipinos, but that&#8217;s something that has to change as it&#8217;s one of the ways we can climb out of where we are now and attempt to become an industrialized country.

Whew, composing this post took a while. I have to admit some of my choices were rushed (particularly for Senator), as most of my decision-making energy was spent researching the Presidentiables. Although things can still change between now and Monday, this will probably be close to my final ballot.

What is your opinion on straight-ticket voting? You don&#8217;t think that it would help your president in getting things done or that it would lessen the chances of clashing political agenda?

Straight-ticket voting is a lot like block voting &#8211; it&#8217;s great for the voter who doesn&#8217;t want to think too hard.

I&#8217;m not inclined to give any one President absolute power; and dominating both the Senate and the House is as close to absolute power as one can legally get within our system.

Well, what roytang says is true, but you have to realize that that option DOES help get things done. Even in a dictatorship that is focused on enriching / empowering only select individuals, whatever mandate the dictator wills is still expeditiously performed. 

I sincerely believe that the Checks and Balances mechanics of a Democracy are intended to stabilize an already secure country, with change happening only if majority or all sides agree on said change (on the notion that, clearly, it must be for the better for most / all the people, since they all want it). 

I&#8217;m inclined to do straight-ticket voting, because I do believe drastic change needs to be done to get the ball rolling. 

But this will only work for sure at the onset. Politics is politics, and no one stays allied for too long. 

Chry, I think what you actually want is then to get are leaders, who, regardless of different political backgrounds, aim for the same platform. Just because they&#8217;re enemies, doesn&#8217;t mean that healthcare enthusiasts will not want healthcare related issues solved (though, leaders will always surprise you).
