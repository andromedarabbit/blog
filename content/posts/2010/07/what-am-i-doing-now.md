I get asked this a lot since I&#8217;m not currently working. I never get to answer clearly, so here&#8217;s an attempt.

The short answer is: **Whatever I want**

The long answer:

1. Yes, I spend a lot of time goofing around &#8211; watching TV series, movies and playing video games. In fact I think for most of the first two months of my hiatus, this was what I did. Now there&#8217;s a lot less of that &#8211; I&#8217;ve caught up with all the series I wanted to catch up with, and I don&#8217;t have any significant video games I want to finish. (That may change next week with the release of Starcraft 2 :p). I don&#8217;t actually watch stuff on television unless I&#8217;m having a meal though.

2. I read a lot. Mostly online reading (so having an IPad would be nice, hah!). A lot of articles about a variety of topics such as entrepreneurship, new technologies, mobile application development, casual gaming development. [Hacker News][1] is a fair approximation of my usual reading material. I probably spend 2-3 hours each day on reading.

3. I&#8217;m working on some small projects. Not work stuff, not freelancing or anything like that. Just some tools/apps, many of them for my own usage (&#8216;to scratch an itch&#8221;, as the saying goes). Often I will start building an app just to try out a certain API or technology. In the past 2 weeks I&#8217;ve looked at: Scala, Ruby, the Android SDK, Google App Engine, the Facebook Graph API, the Twitter API, the Plurk API, Git and Mercurial. It&#8217;s only recently that I&#8217;m getting back into the swing of coding (and seeing my own terrible bugs :p), and I hope to scale that up in the coming months. I want to write more apps that I can release for public consumption.

4. Something people who&#8217;ve been employed all the time don&#8217;t realize: even if I have a lot of free time, I&#8217;m still lazy. :p So there are a lot of backlog tasks I&#8217;ve been meaning to do since forever that I need to get around to. Mostly involves organizing stuff, getting rid of unneeded stuff, returning stuff. Stuff has a maintenance cost, so we should have a lot less of it!

5. I&#8217;m currently not earning any money and am still considering future plans. It&#8217;s fine, I can still survive for a while. There are a lot of options, and getting back into a regular employment scenario is only one of them. The more conventional options are getting a job again and/or working abroad (probably Singapore). My brothers and I talk constantly about starting our own company: consulting/software dev (need to find clients), or product development (IPhone/Android&#8230;but we&#8217;re still balking on the high price of entry to the IPhone market, i.e. need a macbook!). A friend of mine keeps telling me we should start working on a casual game, our own Plants vs Zombies as it were. I&#8217;m inclined to look into some sort of product development myself, in fact I already have a few design ideas for a casual/social MMO (similar to Castle Age&#8230;I like to claim I&#8217;m doing research when I play it).

So that&#8217;s the current status. I&#8217;m still not sure exactly the direction I should be going &#8211; it&#8217;s always been one of my weaknesses that when there are a lot of options available I have difficulty making a decision promptly. Getting a job again is the safe yet boring choice; at the same time I&#8217;m not sure if I&#8217;m equipped with the necessary discipline to handle the more challenging options such as starting my own company.

In any case I&#8217;m not really in a hurry. The whole point of the hiatus was figuring out what I want to be doing. I&#8217;m not sure yet, so hiatus is not yet over. ðŸ˜€
