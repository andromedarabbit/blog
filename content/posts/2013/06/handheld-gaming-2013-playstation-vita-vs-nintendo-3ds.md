I wrote some stuff about Vita vs 3DS in a Reddit post, I thought I&#8217;d expand on it here.

I have access to both a first-generation 3DS with ambassador status (this is actually my brother&#8217;s but he doesn&#8217;t use it much) and a PS Vita which is only a couple of months old.Â I use the Vita a lot more because reasons:

  1. The screen is very very nice, especially compared to the 3DS screens. My eyes hurt a bit after a while of using the 3DS (even with 3D off). The Vita games also look a lot better compared to 3DS ones. The visuals are more crisp and colorful, especially for games like Persona 4 Golden or Disgaea 3.
  2. I&#8217;m a Playstation Plus subscriber (and I have a PS3), which means my available Vita library gets bigger every month without me spending additional money. And with the PS4 support coming, it&#8217;s even better.
  3. No online account for the 3DS means I&#8217;m not going to make digital purchases off the eShop, which limits my available library. I&#8217;m not interested in making eShop purchases that are tied to the machine; I&#8217;m worried about losing or breaking the system and losing access to all my purchases. This is a severe limitation of the 3DS in this age of digital downloads.
  4. I just find that I like more games on the Vita. I like Mario and Zelda on the 3DS (I&#8217;ve finished NSMB, Mario 3D Land and Ocarina of Time; the new Legend of Zelda will probably be the next game I play on 3DS), but aside from that most of the library is meh for me. I played Tales of the Abyss and Paper Mario Sticker Star on the 3ds but both got boring for me after a while (I&#8217;m probably at around 80% of ToA and gave up on Sticker Star at the first boss). I might try out Fire Emblem, and if there&#8217;s a new Advance Wars I&#8217;d jump on that. Etrian Odyssey looks interesting but there are dungeon crawlers on the Vita too. On the Vita so far I&#8217;ve been playing P4G, Disgaea 3 and Gravity Rush, with some Street Fighter x Tekken thrown in every so often. As soon as I get a bigger memory card, I&#8217;m going to get into Blazblue Continuum Shift; Â then there&#8217;s Uncharted and Final Fantasy Tactics and I heard Zero Escape was good, and I want to try Guacamelee, and one of these days I&#8217;m going to give in to impulse buying urges and get Xenogears off the store, oh and if LBP Vita went on sale I&#8217;d get that, etc.Â People who say the Vita doesn&#8217;t have games might just be uninformed; in terms of the number of games I&#8217;m interested the Vita is slightly ahead, and that whole PS1 classic back library puts it leagues ahead.
  5. Achievements/Trophies. I realize a lot of people don&#8217;t care for them and don&#8217;t &#8220;get&#8221; people who like them and that&#8217;s fine, more power to you. But I do like them, though I&#8217;m not like a platinum hunter or anything like that.

The only real downside of the Vita as far as I can tell is that the memory cards are helluva expensive; but maybe that will change this week.

And&#8230;that&#8217;s it. Just thought I&#8217;d write some gaming stuff since E3 is happening in a few hours. ðŸ˜€
