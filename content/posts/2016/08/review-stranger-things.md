So, Stranger Things

It&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s great. I thought it might be overhyped, but it&#8217;s not. And I can see why people find it hard to explain without spoiling things.

It&#8217;s about strange things happening in a small town. Creepy things. It&#8217;s a mystery. It&#8217;s suspense. It&#8217;s not a jump-scare sort of thing if you&#8217;re not into that. Well, there&#8217;s maybe a little bit of jump scares. The best description I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s about as scary as an X-Files or Doctor Who episode. So if that&#8217;s not too scary for you, you&#8217;ll be fine

It&#8217;s about a child who goes missing in a small town (not a spoiler) and the succeeding events. It&#8217;s about the mother searching for her son. It&#8217;s about a group of kids trying to solve a mystery. It&#8217;s about a small-town police chief in over his head. It&#8217;s about the 80s. It&#8217;s about kids in the 80s, music in the 80s, school in the 80s, small American towns in the 80s. It&#8217;s about outcasts and bullies and first times and trying to fit in and how they all deal with these stranger things

It&#8217;s like Stephen King wrote an episode of X-Files and it was directed by Stephen Spielberg starring the cast of Stand By Me. The acting is great too, especially the kids

Maybe minor spoilers follow

It&#8217;s kind of told in that weird True Detective way, with perspectives jumping around a lot among the ensemble cast. Past and present scenes are interspersed with only context to rely on

It keeps you hooked. I wanted to watch only a couple of episodes at first but ended up awake past three AM at episode six. I finished it the net morning

I love how the mystery unfolds to different parties and separately they uncover parts of it and they all come together in the end to force a resolution. I love how the characters overcome their horror-movie tropes. I love all the 80s references and the geeky references

I was satisfied with how it ended and all came together. I&#8217;m not sure what to expect for a second season though
