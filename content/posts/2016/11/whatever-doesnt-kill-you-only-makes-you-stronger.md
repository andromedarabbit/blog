There&#8217;s a very rare, privileged group of people for whom everything in life goes well and they experience great success all the time.

You and I are not part of that group (most likely). Like the vast majority of other people, sometimes our lives are good and sometimes our lives are bad.

Sometimes life can feel cruel or unfair or exhausting. In those times it&#8217;s easy to forget the times when life was good and to wallow in your misery. And I guess to some extent humans need a bit of that wallowing time, but try not to linger there too long.

You have to take the good and the bad life gives you and make what you can of it. Whatever failures or trials you suffer, learn from them and move on. Let the low points forge you into a sharper sword. Whatever doesn&#8217;t kill you only makes you stronger
