The last two entries ([here][1] and [here][2]) took too long to write, and there&#8217;s a helluva lot of other titles to go through. And many of them don&#8217;t deserve much comments, so I&#8217;ll just go through the rest quickly or I might never finish.

_Action Comics_ &#8211; the younger Superman stories are interesting, but occasionally Morrison goes off on one of his weird tangent stories. Superman&#8217;s early years are largely re-written, and that&#8217;s understandable, he&#8217;s never had particularly interesting events in his history anyway
  
_Superman_ &#8211; meh, needs more spice
  
_Superboy_ &#8211; interesting, but the character has yet to find a status quo
  
_Supergirl_ &#8211; interesting, but the character has yet to find a status quo

_Green Lantern_ &#8211; interesting, though it implies Hal is currently a GL in the league with a &#8220;fake&#8221; power ring. Most of the GL history seems to be intact, and the GL books are all leading towards some sort of &#8220;third army&#8221; event, I hope it happens soon.
  
_Green Lantern Corps_ &#8211; interesting enough for me to want to read it before AvX #6 this week
  
_Green Lantern: New Guardians_ &#8211; interesting, but I don&#8217;t see where this is going. Is it possible for Raynier&#8217;s &#8220;Rainbow Guardians&#8221; to become a real team?
  
_Red Lanterns_ &#8211; mildly interesting, but I don&#8217;t see where this is going. I&#8217;m not convinced the Reds were the best corps to give their own series

_Teen Titans_ &#8211; interesting for me, but only because Red Robin is here. The team&#8217;s &#8220;coming together adventure&#8221; has been going on for far too long and they need to reach some sort of status quo
  
_Blue Beetle_ &#8211; interesting, but the character has yet to find a status quo
  
_Legion of Super-Heroes_ &#8211; interesting storylines, but way too many characters, not very accessible
  
_Legion Lost_ &#8211; interesting, but they can&#8217;t get back to their own time without changing the book title, so it kinda limits what&#8217;s going to happen and makes them always on the run

_All-Star Western_ &#8211; interesting, but weird. Not really a superhero book, though it has ties to Gotham City. I&#8217;m not particularly interested in the backup stories though
  
_Deathstroke_ &#8211; not interesting, seems to be mostly just Slade killing a bunch of guys for one reason or another. I&#8217;m not confident about it with Liefeld coming on, but I&#8217;ll probably still read it for a while since I can&#8217;t resist a Â train wreck
  
_Suicide Squad_ &#8211; meh, the squad composition at the moment isn&#8217;t very interesting, the only real personalities there are Deadshot and Harley (at least they&#8217;re giving her something to do aside from being a Joker fangirl)
  
_Stormwatch_ &#8211; mildly interesting, if only because they&#8217;re going to need to be fighting the JL at some point. Some of their science-y explanations are ridiculous though
  
_Grifter_ &#8211; meh, doesn&#8217;t seem to be going anywhere serious.
  
_Voodoo_ &#8211; meh, not sure where it&#8217;s going. Also, with all this Daemonite activity going on, how is it Stormwatch isn&#8217;t seriously cracking down on them?
  
_Resurrection Man_ &#8211; I like the concept, but the storyline seems to be going nowhere serious
  
_Man O War_ &#8211; I tried to bear with this, but it just bored me. I only managed to read up to issue 7

_Justice League Dark_ &#8211; interesting, though they&#8217;re not really a real &#8220;team&#8221; at the moment. But the team composition is solid, especially they dropped Shade who wasn&#8217;t really doing anything for the book. Andrew Bennet seems a better fit
  
_Swamp Thing_ &#8211; interesting, but might be a bit too weird for some, since a lot of the book feels like Alec Holland being on an acid trip of some sort. Feels very Vertigo.
  
_Animal Man_ &#8211; see Swamp Thing. Art is pretty good, but still weird.
  
_Frankenstein, Agent of SHADE_ &#8211; interesting enough. Art is&#8230; unique.
  
_I, Vampire_ &#8211; surprisingly interesting, even if I&#8217;m already reading another Vampire series (American Vampire). Curious to see where it goes.
  
_Demon Knights_ &#8211; surprisingly interesting, the team composition is nice and varied (Vandal Savage, wut) and the storylines are a fresh reprieve from superhero stuff

_DC Comics Presents_ &#8211; Deadman was ok, Challengers less interesting for me. Good series for them to keep around and showcase lesser-known characters

And the second wave of the New 52, of which we are only one or two issues in:
  
_Batman Incorporated_ &#8211; looking good, easily better than both Detective and Dark Knight
  
_Earth 2_ &#8211; the second issue was a bit slow, but it looks interesting enough
  
_Worlds&#8217; Finest_ &#8211; the first issue wasn&#8217;t the best, but I like the idea of this comic so I&#8217;ll keep reading it
  
_Dial H_ &#8211; off to a good start, but I can&#8217;t help but wonder whether they&#8217;ll be running out of hero ideas at some point. Also, Pelican Army!
  
_GI Combat_ &#8211; okay, I didn&#8217;t like the last war book, I&#8217;m not gonna bother with this one.
  
_The Ravagers_ &#8211; giving this a shot, although at the moment it just seems like another &#8220;bunch of super teens on the run from evil forces&#8221; kinda deal, and that&#8217;s already what Teen Titans is doing at the moment.

I&#8217;m probably going to keep on reading a good 70-80% of the books going forward, I don&#8217;t feel compelled to read every single one of them any more. It&#8217;s still a good chunk of books to read, and makes me look forward to the new releases every week.
