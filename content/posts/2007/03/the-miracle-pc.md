My computer died last night, refusing to boot. Ubuntu would complain of being unable to read the root filesystem. Windows XP would say that there&#8217;s a corrupted DLL. I immediately arranged to borrow both an Ubuntu LiveCD and a Windows XP install disk the next day to help check the problem.

When I got home today, the computer had been miraculously fixed. My brother said he&#8217;d been using it no problem.

I knew before that the internet had the capacity to heal itself. I&#8217;m surprised my PC also this capacity.

I have no idea if I need to do any sort of diagnostics on this machine.

Scan for malware perhaps? Sounds like something was trying to hide a dll and
  
the boot sector from the OS to me &#8211; of course I could just be paranoid.

Nah, I found it really it was bad memory. (The mem test that came with Ubuntu
  
really helped)

I removed one of the 256MB pieces and Ubuntu works fine now (although I now
  
have only 256MB of memory left). Windows XP cannot boot at all, I guess one of
  
the files really did become corrupted. So I'm now a 100% linux user (at least
  
for the PC in my room)
