The official title is quite long. Actually, the English Title for

is even worse!

Ace Attorney is an awesome series, I finally got around to playing the second game since the third one is scheduled for an English NDS release in September. I started playing the day I arrived in HK &#8211; so I beat the game in six days.

Justice for All is a more difficult game than the original, putting the title character in more difficult situations, and making it a lot more tedious to &#8216;cheat&' with the save file. The first 3 cases were not that tough &#8211; I beat one per day. But the last case, I actually got stuck at one point and had to &#8220;cheat&#8221; with an FAQ.

I&'m looking forward to the third game, where I hear you get to defend&#8230;Phoenix Wright!
