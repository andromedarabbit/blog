Check. Yeap, I turned 29 a couple of days ago.

There&#8217;s a typhoon signal no. 8 over HK right now as I type this. For people in the Philippines, that&#8217;s hard to imagine since our local indicators only go up to storm signal no. 4. But it&#8217;s really a bit calm where I am right now, some wind but not much rain. I&#8217;m not inclined to go out though, I&#8217;m running out of clothes as it is.

I&#8217;m flying back next Tuesday, hopefully the storm has dissipated by then. I miss my own bed. :p
