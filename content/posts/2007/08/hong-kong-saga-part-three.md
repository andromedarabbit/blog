It&#8217;s a bit strange, but somehow Hong Kong is becoming a bit familiar to me by now. This is only my third time here of course, and I&#8217;ve spent less than five weeks here in total since 2004. Still I find that certain things like ordering at restaurants and riding the MTR have started to become a bit more &#8220;normal&#8221; for me.

Originally when I was told that I would be staying in HK for two weeks, I was a bit depressed, as I didn&#8217;t really enjoy the prolonged stay last time. Hong Kong is not a particularly exciting place for me as I&#8217;m not the sort of person who totally enjoys being either a tourist or a shopper, which are the usual reasons why people come to HK. I&#8217;m not planning to go to Disneyland or Ocean Park so when people ask what I plan to do during the weekend I just tell them the truth: I have no plans. Probably bum around.

The trip is more pleasant this time around, as I&#8217;m really at the starting end of a project and things are not so busy. Also, the place we are staying at now has free high-speed wi-fi internet connection, and I was able to borrow a laptop for my use during weekends, so I can goof off on the internet whenever I get bored. In times like these I really consider buying a laptop. Although, traveling once a year is not really a good reason to get one.

At the place we have been working at, there&#8217;s this guy who speaks English in a way that is so obviously Filipino. Every country has it&#8217;s own unique accent of English I suppose, so it&#8217;s immediately obvious when someone is speaking English in a manner that you can easily grok.

As I type this, mentally I hear myself saying it with a Chinese accent, as is my tendency when hanging around people with strange accents too long. Probably my grasp of good English grammar is suffering a bit as well.

This was a random rant, thanks.
