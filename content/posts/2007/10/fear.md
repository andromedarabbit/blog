I was in Galleria earlier today and suddenly the power went out for a few seconds. It came back up almost immediately, but of course everyone was a bit spooked given the recent bombings at Glorietta 2.

Even I felt a bit shaken up I might add, even considering cutting short the tournament ([I wasn&#8217;t doing well][1]) I hate that. Being overcome by fear, even for a very short instant. Hopefully, the authorities would be able to find whoever was responsible for the recent bombings to make the rest of us feel safer.

would that really make us feel safer? sometimes, we can't even be sure if the
  
authorities have got the right group/person. or if they did,&#8230; its seldom
  
that they can stop the next attack.

am not really the type to have angsts against the govt. but for me, i get my
  
'security' from somewhere/someone else.

Dunno, maybe not. But that's what I was thinking at that instant. Right now,
  
they say it was a gas leak, and I find I don't particularly care. Also, there
  
was an explosion at the Batasan and I think people shrug that off even more
  
than the one at G2.

We're all getting so desensitized to this sort of stuff.
