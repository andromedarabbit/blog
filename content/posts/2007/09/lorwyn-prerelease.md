Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t make it to the AM flights yesterdat, so I hung around Galleria for a few hours watching people play. A lot of people seemed to be playing blue or green stuff. There are people saying Needle Drop is good, what? Just because it cantrips?

My flight manages to start around 4 PM, and I open the sealed pool I&#8217;m registering. The first two rares I see are Jace Beleren and Chandra Nalar! Holy crap! It means of course, that I have to pass this pool. (That always happens when I get really good bombs) Anyway, I get a decent pool as well, with Austere Command (Wrath of God!), a foil Cryptic Command (not that I&#8217;d play it), and lots of removal. I ended up with the following WRb deck:

1 Goldmeadow Harrier
   

   
1 Cenn&#8217;s Heir
   

   
1 Avian Changeling
   

   
1 Knight of Meadowgrain
   

   
1 Springjack Knight
   

   
1 Kithkin Harbinger
   

   
1 Kinsbaile Balloonist
   

   
2 Plover Knights
   

   
1 Shriekmaw
   

   
1 Fire-Belly Changeling
   

   
1 Thundercloud Shaman
   

   
1 Hearthcage Giant

1 Tarfire
   

   
1 Nameless Inversion
   

   
1 Eyeblight&#8217;s Ending
   

   
1 Surge of Thoughtweft
   

   
1 Neck Snap
   

   
1 Austere Command
   

   
1 Wanderer&#8217;s Twig
   

   
1 Runed Stalactite
   

   
1 Moonglove Extract
   

   
1 Giant&#8217;s Ire

1 Ancient Ampitheatre
   

   
1 Vivid Marsh
   

   
8 Plains
   

   
6 Mountains
   

   
1 Swamp

I went 3-1 with this sealed deck, a bit disappointed too coz I thought the pool was really good (I had a Wrath! Well, the Thundercloud Shaman also acted like a one-sided Wrath at one point) I lost to a blue black deck where I just kept getting dead land draws. One turn from losing to two black creatures with me having only one non-black blocker, I said, &#8220;I have so much removal in this deck, surely I will draw one now.&#8221; And I did, I got Shriekmaw. :/ I&#8217;m always disappointed when I get my loss in a Pre-release, I haven&#8217;t won a pre-release shirt since Time Spiral!

Anyway, the set is fun, the tribal implementation seems really good. (Not sure how it compares to Onslaught, I have no memory of Onslaught limited, although I&#8217;m sure we played it a bit back then as I have the cards to prove it). The Changelings are great; the more you have in your sealed pool, the stronger the pool becomes as you have more options. I was sad that I only got two shapeshifters. Clash is stupidly fun. You seldom win, but it&#8217;s exciting! Surely Spikes won&#8217;t like the mechanic, I guess it&#8217;s more of a Timmy thing. Well, I guess it wasn&#8217;t fun for that guy I fought who drew something like 12 or 14 cards of Hoarder&#8217;s Greed. I just kept a land on top to keep him going. Yeah, I won that one

I wanted to play again today, but I wouldn&#8217;t have gotten there in time I think. I hope we get more limited Lorwyn events. Since I&#8217;m probably not going to be buying a box this time around, I need to play more Limited to win/acquire cards until I have something decent for Constructed.
