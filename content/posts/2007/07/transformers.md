As a big Transformers fan back in the day, I have to say: the movie is okay. Action-packed and a fun popcorn flick. The story&#8217;s nothing to win an oscar over, but everything looks SO COOL!

Some questionable things though:

Spoilers!

  * Why does the all-spark only create violent, gun-toting robots? Where the hell did the Autobots come from?
  * I don&#8217;t recall seeing the Decepticon symbol anywhere, was it there?
  * How come Soundwave can survive getting his head chopped off, but Jazz can&#8217;t take being split in half?

Hell of a movie.
