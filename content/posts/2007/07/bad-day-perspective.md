Some days just don&#8217;t go very well. You wake up with a mild headache. Your bed demands that you stay just a few minutes longer. Your computer refuses to work correctly. You have no energy. Every task assigned to you seems to be something you&#8217;d rather not do. You find out some people hate you. You get drenched in rain on the way home. You arrive home and feel completely useless, thinking you&#8217;ve done nothing today.

I was planning to write about how I had a bad day, but then the above paragraph got out of hand. Exaggerated even. I look at it and &#8220;eh, my day wasn&#8217;t so bad.&#8221; A little perspective changes everything. (Many of the things in the above paragraph did not happen to me.)
