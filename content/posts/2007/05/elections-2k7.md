I still don&#8217;t know how I am voting on Monday.

Or even if I am voting at all.

I&#8217;m thinking of voting for those 3 guys from Kapatiran, simply to reward the sheer chutzpah of their candidacies.

The GO and TU coalitions seem largely irrelevant to me, you can be fairly sure those coalitions won&#8217;t mean squat after the elections, so all these surveys keeping score of administration vs opposition seem a bit useless. I&#8217;m no lover of the GMA administration, but the opposition&#8217;s offerings don&#8217;t leave a very good taste in the mouth either. I&#8217;d much rather bring in new blood, non-politicians like the Kapatiran guys.

Or maybe I should just go with the recent ads that have appeared exhorting people to boycott the senatorial slots altogether?

This election seems so&#8230; bleah.

Although I should note, I think AGHAM party list is a good idea.

At least the mayoral elections in Quezon City are a no-brainer.
