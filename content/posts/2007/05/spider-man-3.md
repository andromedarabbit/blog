Pretty good movie, as expected. The story is what you'd expect from a comic-book movie, but the mid-air fight scenes are really great.

The whole Sandman thing is basically fluff, the movie could have been done without him. He was like a cheap pop to make the whole &#8220;dark side&#8221; thing easier to start off, but then they had trouble resolving his story. It's not like he's a major Spidey villain anyway. Green Goblin, Doc Ock, Venom&#8230;that would have been good enough for a trilogy of Spidey movies, all the major bad guys covered.

J. Jonah Jameson is funny as always. It's hard to take Topher Grace seriously when I keep thinking of him as Eric Foreman. Some of the drama parts are a bit over the top, but The funny bits of the movie are pretty good. The ending is a bit lame though.

I don't think I made any spoilers. Unless you didn't already know Sandman and Venom would be there.

Makes me wonder, because I realize that Topher Grace did play the lead on That
  
70's Show, but Eric Foreman is also the name of the doctor played by Omar Epps
  
in House.

haven't watched it. and probably won't have the time to. so ill wait for the
  
dvd.

i have to agree with you though, these kinda films are the type you watch for
  
the fight scenes and the graphics.

i agree.

it's kind of like x-men 3 where the sequel did not disappoint and was more
  
intent in tying up loose ends. the people i watched it with said *spoiler
  
alert* venom should've been harder to get rid of/stronger as a villain. after
  
he becomes venom, i sorta lost the topher grace= eric foreman thing. gotta
  
love those teeth.

Peng: Yeah, there probably won't be a Spider-man 4 after this, seeing how they
  
tried to cram so much into this movie. I wonder if the DVD version will be
  
longer?

Art: If you no longer have time to watch Spider-man on the big screen, then I
  
fear for your soul my friend. :p

Mike: I don't actually watch House.
