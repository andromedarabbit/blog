title: Should I Go Across The World?

I&'ve been asked if I would be willing to be temporarily posted in another country, halfway across the world, for around half a year.

On the surface, it seems like a good idea &#8211; I don&'t have any definite plans for the next few months, so there&'s nothing in the way. It would be new stuff, new places, people, experiences, etc., a most welcome change of pace.

But the first emotion that grips me is fear. Of the unknown I suppose. Of doing something I hadn&'t done before. But then my focus on courage as a value comes through, and I recognize the fear for what it is: something to be conquered. I strike through the fear.

I will give my answer today. Will any of this come to pass?

Thanks Peng. I've already told them I'm willing to go, but asked for assurance
  
that I would have internet at home when I'm there. ðŸ˜€ Don't know if it will
  
push through&#8230;

I believe it's quite difficult and, of course, fearful but all these
  
difficulties and fears will vanish because going accross the world is very
  
interesting.
