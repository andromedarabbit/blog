I upgraded my Kubuntu Linux installation to Edgy Eft during the Christmas break. Some notes:

* Why can&#8217;t there be a one-click install? You know, some pop-up alert bubble in the corner saying &#8220;A new version of Kubuntu is available.&#8221; I don&#8217;t see why the user needs to edit the sources.list file, do the apt-get stuff, etc., when all of this can basically be automated away.

* Except for one thing, I can do everything I need to do using Kubuntu instead of using Windows. Unfortunately, that one thing I cannot do is something that I do a lot: gaming. Unfortunately, I&#8217;m pretty sure gamers drive a huge portion of the desktop market. I boldly predict that desktop Linux will not be able to be a serious challenge to Windows until it can provide some sort of alternative gaming platform.

* I was thinking about using Kubuntu continuously for about a week, just to see how it would be, and also to see if it&#8217;s as stable as they make it out to be. Unfortunately, for some reason booting into Kubuntu now deprives me of internet. I&#8217;d fix it, but somehow it doesn&#8217;t seem worth the trouble. So, as of now, I&#8217;m quitting using Linux indefinitely. (I&#8217;ll miss the bash shell though.)
