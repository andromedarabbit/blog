I&'m testing the [Extreme Video Plugin][1] for WordPress, and I thought, what better way to do so than to further propagate the extreme music videos of [
  
Ok Go][2].

Some of the new guys at the office performed the above dance as their Christmas initiation&#8230;er, presentation, and let me tell you, the audience was on its&' feet. Ok Go is an American band that is known for outrageous live performances like the above. The above video is their own song, &#8220;A Million Ways.&#8221; They have another video for another song, [nvolving treadmills][3]. It&'s said that they did that treadmill thing _in one take_. That sounds too awesome to be true&#8230;
