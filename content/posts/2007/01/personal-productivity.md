Since I&#8217;m going back to work starting on Saturday, I thought I&#8217;d try to look for ways to improve my productivity at work.

I&#8217;ve downloaded a few utilities that I can try at work to see if it can improve my workflow.

The first one is [SlickRun][1]. Basically it&#8217;s a Start -> Run replacement &#8211; press a predefined hotkey and a small command line tool appears where I can type shortcut-like commands. One of the features I liked while using Kubuntu was something similar &#8211; I think it was called Katapult. It sorts of automates an old trick I was using before, where I would put shortcuts to commonly used programs in a predefined folder that exists on the path. I&#8217;ll see if this is better than that one, since this one requires less effort to set up the shortcuts.

Second is an egg-timer type app, [AleJenJes Countdown Timer
  
][2] &#8211; I don&#8217;t know why it has such a weird name. But anyway, it&#8217;s just a simple Stop/Go timer I can use for timeboxing.

Last is a Window WP right-click menu addon, [FileMenuTools][3]. Some nice common tasks can be added to the context menu, some I do regularly.

I&#8217;ve also looked at some a few PIM programs, but my experience is that I&#8217;m not very good at this sort of thing&#8230;the only one that&#8217;s stuck to me for a while was [GTDTiddlyWiki][4], and I don&#8217;t even use that regularly anymore. I&#8217;m thinking I should find some way to integrate task management into my workflow. Maybe I could write the program myself, the requirements are simple:

1. I want to be able to specify tasks that I want to be reminded of. As an initial example, maybe I could schedule daily, weekly or monthly tasks.

2. At the start of each day, or when I boot up my computer (configurable), the program would dump all tasks for that day in the middle of my workflow.

&#8211; At the office, it could send me an email.

&#8211; At home, I could add a local web page to my Firefox tabs.

That&#8217;s basically it. I can add more features or bells and whistles later. I could probably put together a quick scripts + text files solution, similar to the

&#8211; in fact, I&#8217;ll go read that first for ideas.
