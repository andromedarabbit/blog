Finally finished Valkyria Chronicles last Saturday, clocking in at around 25 hours. Quick Review:

  * Beautiful, beautiful game, even on my SD TV; it&#8217;s like watching a flowing watercolor painting
  * When you start the game, all the dialogue/cutscenes seems a bit draggy but eventually you get used to the pacing and then you don&#8217;t mind because the battles are really engaging. Speaking of battles;
  * I&#8217;m not sure if it would be good for beginners to tactical games. Unlike the FFT series and similar games, most battles require a decent strategy and grasp of tactics to complete. I kept getting Game Overs at the start because I was playing it like an FFT clone. It actually reminds me more of X-Com: UFO Defense&#8217;s squad-based tactics. You need to move, shoot, then run for cover. Always make sure your troops aren&#8217;t open to enemy fire and your tank&#8217;s weak spot isn&#8217;t exposed. You pretty much always need to find a way to sneak around the enemy troops as your weaker troops will not often survive rushing headlong into enemy fire. Each class (Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer, Sniper) has a definite role to play and you&#8217;ll need to know when to use each type of unit. You also need to consider finishing battles as quickly as possible to get higher scores and bonus experience/money. Early battles take around 30 mins to complete; later battles in the neighborhood of 1.5-2 hours. Don&#8217;t worry, you can save in-battle. (Yes, I sometimes reload when my sniper misses a clear headshot!) It&#8217;s definitely top-notch tactical gameplay that&#8217;s innovative compared to other games tagged as SRPGs.
  * There&#8217;s some replay value here also; The New Game Plus mode gives you a chance to try to get higher scores in each battle, plus there are optional Skirmish battles which I will probably try to beat at some point (I finished the game with minimal grinding, so I only played one Skirmish Battle). I wish it had trophies though =/
  * Overall, a highly recommended game. Unfortunately it didn&#8217;t sell very well despite the awesome reviews; the RPG audience is probably very small on the PS3 due to the lack of quality RPG titles for the console, but hopefully Sega decides to release a sequel sometime despite the low sales figures.
