The gist of it is: it wasn&#8217;t as annoying as I had been led to expect.

Frankly, I think it&#8217;s better than XP, but I might be blinded by the fact that it&#8217;s very pretty. Visually it&#8217;s a step up from XP the same way XP was a step up from &#8217;95. The XP box at work seems so bland to me now.

The file manager (Explorer) is very nice, I like the functionality of being able to navigate the address bar by mouse click (though I never used this back in Ubuntu) and the ability to sort files even in thumbnail view. The desktop gadgets are neat but probably not really that useful, though I still keep them around.

IE7 so far has been tolerable, except that I found out just now that it has Javascript errors when I&#8217;m using the WordPress RTE for posting. Also, the Ctrl+K shortcut for the search box is missing, but I still insitinctively use it all the time. I think I&#8217;m going to switch to Firefox right after posting. :p

All the permission prompts that I had heard people complain about didn&#8217;t really bother me. They only come up when you need to do administrative-related tasks, and coming from Ubuntu I&#8217;m a bit used to it.

I haven&#8217;t removed most of the preinstalled Acer crap yet, but I&#8217;ve removed the 90-day trial of Norton Antivirus and replaced it with Avast antivirus.

Oh, Windows Update is prompting me for a restart! It&#8217;s also my first time working with an OS that has Windows Update enabled, and some people have told me how annoying the restart prompts are especially while playing games. Luckily, I can afford to restart right now.

All in all, Vista seems okay, and I believe it&#8217;s a good upgrade to XP, which has been getting boring to me. I was originally planning on dual-booting this laptop with Linux, but I think I&#8217;ll stick with Vista for a while.

I think OEM vendors have some kind of agreement with McAfee and Norton which
  
forces them to install these antiviruses &#8211; no matter how bad performing they
  
are. If I'm more or less tolerant with McAfee, then Norton is a system killer.
  
I've just come across a report where it's said that Norton slows start-up by
  
50%. Awful! Avast antivirus is much less resource-hungry.
