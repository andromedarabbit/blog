The tournament was last Saturday, Aug 16 at Robinson&#8217;s Galleria. I played the same deck as

, except I had the following sideboard:

The extra removal was geared towards the kithkin matchup, which was unknown to me at the time. As is usual for me, I lacked playtesting; with the justification that these PTQS

were

my playtesting for the GP.

Tournament report follows! My memory is a bit sparse, so I&#8217;ll gloss over some of the details.

**
    
Round 1
   
** 
   
: PWC Special vs GRBW Persist

I won this in three games. The opponent&#8217;s deck was very rogue&#8230;tons of persist creatures: Murderous Redcap, Kitchen Finks, Twilight Shepherd&#8230;and
   
[Rendclaw Troll][2]
   
. Yeah, look it up.

Games: 2-1, Matches: 1-1

Round 2:
   
** 
   
PWC Special vs Kithkin/Mirror Master

Ooh, my first Kithkin matchup with this deck! Let&#8217;s see how I do. The following picture from my life total notes should explain it clearly:

Long version: I lost the first game quite badly.

In the second game, I managed to stabilize and race. My army had been tapped low by Pollen Lullaby and the guys weren&#8217;t going to untap. All I had was a Mirror Entity. He was on six and I was at nine (see the life totals in the image!) He had six spirit tokens and a random kithkin (I think it was a Meadowgrain).

So he plays Ajani, pumps &#8217;em all and swings for the kill. I show my own Pollen Lullaby and we clash: He shows a land, I show&#8230;
   
<card>
    
Cryptic Command!{/CARD]. I&#8217;ve practically won; despite Ajani&#8217;s vigilance, I could tap down his army with the Command (and bounce Ajani), and the effect from Pollen Lullaby still applies so they won&#8217;t untap before my army gets another swing.

So he says done, I don&#8217;t untap and draw my Cryptic Command. At this point, I have seven lands in play and an active Mirror Entity. I look at the life totals and see he&#8217;s at six. Somehow, what goes through my head is that the Entity could kill him in one swing. So I did! And I immediately pumped for seven!

The spirit tokens were all of course, still quite untapped as I had not yet played the Cryptic Command. T_T

Wow, what a lapse. I had to write &#8220;MISPLAY&#8221; in all caps so that I never forget.

Games: 2-3, Matches: 1-1

**
     
Round 3:
    
** 
    
PWC Special vs Demigod Red

I got lucky in both games 2 and 3 as he drew far too many land and couldn&#8217;t finish me off.

Games: 5-5, Matches: 2-1

While waiting for the next round, I did a few playtest games with Joel &#8220;gjarkeld&#8221; Bantilles playing Kithkin, so I could get a better feel for the matchup. I don&#8217;t usually name drop here, pero gusto raw ni Joel mabanggit sa blog ko e!

Round 4:
    
** 
    
PWC Special vs Kithkin/Mirrormaster

Second time around, I have a better idea how to fight the matchup. The main defensive key in game one is the Banneret into Sower opening. Even if they kill the Sower, it&#8217;s like you time walked them since they didn&#8217;t do anything for a turn. If you do get to untap with the Sower, you&#8217;re iin good shape. I won game one this way.

For game two, I sided into board control:

-4 Merfolk Reejerey, -2 Peppersmoke, -1 Mirror Entity, -1 Bitterblossom, +2 Hallowed Burial, +2 Shriekmaw, +2 Eyeblight&#8217;s Ending, +2 Pollen Lullaby

I pulled out the Reejereys because I didn&#8217;t want him to be a Mirrorweave target. (More on this in round seven!)

I won game two in three quick swings according to my notes.

Games: 7-5, Matches: 3-1

**
     
Round 5:
    
** 
    
PWC Special vs Justice Toast

I remember reading somewhere that Justice Toast was an underdog to Merfolk, so I wasn&#8217;t too worried. I figured as long as I could stick a Bitterblossom or hit the Merfolk aggro engine, I should be fine. None of those things happened in two games!

Games: 7-7, Matches: 3-2

Hay&#8230;I was thinking of dropping at this point, but I figured I needed more play experience for the GP (I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be able to play in the last 2 Sunday GPTs)

**
     
Round 6:
    
** 
    
PWC Special vs Kithkin (again)

I wasn&#8217;t sure whether he was in fact playing Mirror Master since in game one he showed me only the Goldmeadow tapper and Rise of the Hobgoblins and a million plains. I boarded -2 Peppersmoke, +2 Hallowed Burial since I wasn&#8217;t sure.

I won both games off the Banneret into Sower plan, since he didn&#8217;t draw any Unmakes.

Games: 9-7, Matches: 4-2

**
     
Round 7:
    
** 
    
PWC Special vs Kithkin yet again

I was expecting I would win round 5 since my tendency seems to be to gravitate towards a 5-2 record. Unluckily I was paired againt Joel (whom I mentioned above; dapat daw sabihin ko &#8220;Hayup yung si Joel!&#8221;)

In game one he dropped me to below 10 quickly, but I stabilized a bit with a Bitterblossom. He was still at 20 and I had an entity, so I figured I needed to get a creature advantage and then entity him to death. I thought about it for a bit, then played a second Bitterblossom. I was hoping that either I would draw a Cryptic Command or he would have 1-2 turns without drawing creatures, in which case the Bitterblossom advantage would be enough. Unfortunately I went to as low as 2 and we still had equal counts and the next draw was a land, so I scooped for game two.

I went with the same board plan as round 4 here, bringing out the Reejereys.

In game two I hit every Kithkin with removal as soon as it game down, then went into Bitterblossom mode, and we were racing again. I eventually won due to winning a Pollen Lullaby clash.

In game three, he had a quick start and all I had were Bitterblossoms and Sage&#8217;s Dousings. Even if had drawn a Sower to stop the tide, he had Moonglove Extract and Unmake in hand.

Joel commented that I should have boarded out the Dousings, and instead kept in the Reejereys (more creatures). In retrospect he was probably right, especially since I was on the draw.

I shook my fist at him and swore vendetta (not really), and then signed the match slip for my disappointing finish.

Final Record:

Games: 10-9, Matches: 4-3

About the deck:
    
** 

Right now, I&#8217;d say there&#8217;s about a 60-70% chance I&#8217;ll be playing this deck at the Grand Prix (even though I&#8217;ve been known to make deck switches at the last minute)! I went 2-2 against Kithkin today, and 2-1 against other decks. One of the Kithkin losses was arguably due to sheer stupidity/lack of focus, so there&#8217;s definitely room for improvement there that should come with practice.

Now to figure out the QnT matchup&#8230;
