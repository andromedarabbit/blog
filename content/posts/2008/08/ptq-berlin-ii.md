2nd PTQ was last Saturday, August 23 at Robinson&#8217;s Calleria. I brought a slightly modified version of the greedy deck:

The venue is crowded as the PTQ is the same day as WoW TCG Nationals. There aren&#8217;t enough tables, so around 40% of the players need to wait for tables to be freed up before they can play. As you can imagine, this makes for long rounds, around 1 hour and 45 minutes each.

Round 1 vs Kithkin: 0-2 loss

As usual, I got trampled in game one and managed to fight him off in game two only to lose by the slimmest of margins.

Round 2 vs Elementals: 1-2 loss

The card advantage off Mulldrifters (and Mannequin&#8217;ed Mulldrifters) really hurts here. I can hold off his forces and manage to get a Hallowed Burial to take away all his guys in game three, but he has a full grip so he just untaps and shows me the Horde of Notions while I&#8217;m at five life.

Bah! With the lack of tables and losses, I tell DJ to drop me from the tournament as we report the result. I figured it wasn&#8217;t worth it. But then I remembered a guy I was trading with would arrive around 6 PM, and it was only 3:30 (yes, it was 3:30 and we were still in round 2), so I took it back and went in for some more punishment.

Round 3: 2-0 win vs B/W Runed Halo deck.

With the lack of tables we&#8217;re forced to play at the nearby Dim Sum place (luckily they didn&#8217;t chase us away). The kid is a nice guy, but he&#8217;s playing in his first tournament and he learned Magic barely three weeks ago. He has nice cards though &#8211; his deck had Rune Halos, Archons of Justice, Hallowed Burial, Oona. Unfortunately, he had too many do-nothings &#8211; first time I&#8217;ve ever seen
   
[Goldenglow Moth][1]
   
and
   
[Greater Auramancy][2]
   
in a constructed deck (I know you need to click the links &#8211; I doubt you know what those cards are!).

I crush him without any opposition. I give him some friendly words of advice, although I&#8217;m not sure how he felt taking them from someone who was 0-2.

Round 4 vs Faeries: 2-1 win.

I get Bitterblossom advantage in game two. In game three, I won the race by tapping him down with Cryptic Command.

Round 5 vs Demigod: 2-1 win

Not your usual Demigod deck, as he has random Creakwood Lieges and Bitterblossoms. But I saw the Demigod in game one, so Crib Swaps were boarded in.

I won game one. In game two I saw a hand with two lands, two Silvergill Adepts and a Banneret and I figured it was good. Except when I played my first land I realized I had kept a Mutavault and a Sunken Ruins. I couldn&#8217;t cast anything before he killed me. I came back in game three and won without taking any damage.

At this point, I&#8217;m feeling a streak, thinking maybe I can still win 3 more in a row to hit 6-2. This is a lie; at every point in the tournament I&#8217;m thinking I can win all the remaining ones. I just mentioned it here because obviously I would be disappointed.

Round 6 vs QnT: 0-2 loss

In game one, I was at 10 life and he was at 14, and I figured a 2nd Bitterblossom would close the gap so I risked it. On his turn, he hit me with Profane Command for 4, bringing back Kitchen Finks, giving me 3 turns to live and 16 points to chase. I try to Cryptic Command my own Bitterblossom on the fatal turn, but he showed me his own command and would have none of it.

In game two I&#8217;m stuck on two lands, with Dousings, Adepts and a Banneret in my hand, but I have colored mana this time. I play the Adepts first, hoping to draw into lands. I don&#8217;t draw anymore and am forced to play the Banneret, which gets wiped away in a Firespout. In hindsight, since my hand had 2 Dousings (and I drew the 3rd one shortly after), I should have led with Adept, then Banneret, giving me 3 power on board and 3 turns of countermagic available. He was stuck at four lands all game, so that play might have been enough. Since I didn&#8217;t do it, he managed to play a Chameleon Colossus which takes me down for 20.

I&#8217;ve had enough, I&#8217;m out.

Final record: 3-3 matches, 7-8 games.

It&#8217;s too much. I can&#8217;t play this deck at the Grand Prix. The wins are too marginal, and the Kithkin matchup is too much of a tossup. I need to think about how I&#8217;m going to modify it (or what deck to audible into)
