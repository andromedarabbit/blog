I&#8217;ve been submerged in work for the past two weeks or so, not having much time to do anything else aside from work and the DS, which lets me sneak in some Professor Layton, FFTA2 or Civilization Revolutions while waiting for bug fixes to be confirmed.

So I took a break this weekend and won&#8217;t be reporting back to work until Wednesday. No plans really, just some unplanned downtime to unwind a bit&#8230;
