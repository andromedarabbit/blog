A bit late, but for the record I went 1-3 in the Eventide Release Party with my very lame pool. (I swear, I get Dramatic Entrance all the time in sealed!)

After the release event, I played in an EVE-EVE-EVE draft, where I went 2-1 and didn&#8217;t manage to raredraft anything valuable.

Tomorrow: Philippine Open (Block)!
