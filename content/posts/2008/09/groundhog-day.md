I caught Groundhog Day for the Nth time today on HBO (N roughly around 50). My father claims it&#8217;s his favorite movie of all time; high praise considering he watches every movie that comes out EVER. I&#8217;m not actually going to talk about the movie; it&#8217;s awesome, if you haven&#8217;t seen it, you should. You&#8217;re missing half your life.

If you had one day of eternity, what would you do?

Too bad it&#8217;s not possible to train to be Batman (your body gets reset every morning); you need to focus on mastering mental disciplines first. Ideally you would have an internet connection available; it should take a few man-years or so to memorize Wikipedia. Probably at some point I would test the limits of what a human being could accomplish in the span of 24 hours. Is it possible to take over the world in 24 hours? Since you get infinite repeats, maybe.

I wonder if a remake of Groundhog Day would sell in this day and age.
