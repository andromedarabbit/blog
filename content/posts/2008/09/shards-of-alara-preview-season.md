&#8230;starts next week.

Taking a break from typing up my Grand Prix Manila blog entries, here&#8217;s my prediction for the type of manafixing we&#8217;ll see in Alara:
 
  


> Grixis Land
> 
> Land (Common)
> 
> T: Add 1 to your mana pool.
> 
> 2, T: Add RBU to your mana pool.
> 
> Whenever you would add G or W to your mana pool, add 1 to your mana pool instead.
