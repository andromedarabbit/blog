My current blog app supports syntax highlighting in the blog posts, something I cribbed off [Djangosnippet #119][1]

One problem I encountered was that there was no quick visual reference for the styles available with pygments, so I wrote a short demo page [here][2] so that I could easily see the appearance of each syntax highlighting class.

Of course, I haven&#8217;t had a chance to use it in a post yet&#8230;
