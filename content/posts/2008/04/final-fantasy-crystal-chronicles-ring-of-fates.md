is a different game for the NDS, though I guess it&#8217;s sort of a spiritual successor. I finally managed to get some NDS time and finish this game last night.

FFC: RoF follows the story of the twins Yuri and Chelinka who live a simple life with their father in an isolated cabin. Things are not as they seem however and of course eventually the twins&#8217; world is turned upside-down and they find themselves having to find dangerous beasts and cast powerful magicks. It&#8217;s the usual RPG fare, albeit a bit too kiddified at some points. And as you would expect from a Square Enix title, we get an ending that&#8217;s literally out of this world.

It&#8217;s got the usual action RPG trappings: swinging your sword, jumping around, puzzles that involve really big switches, etc. Gameplay-wise it&#8217;s pretty decent, with each of the four main characters providing different styles of play (although Yuri is definitely the strongest one&#8230;or that just might be because I always gave him the best stuff). The difficulty level is not that high, though some people may find the platforming bits off-putting. Boss battles are the usual fare &#8211; figure out the enemy&#8217;s attack patterns and how to beat them, etc. The game does a good job of curving you up to make sure you know how to use the various gameplay mechanics.

My first complaint is about a particular &#8220;gate&#8221; in the final dungeon. Games like RPGs are sometimes referred to as &#8220;gate-driven&#8221;, because the player is presented with a sequence of &#8220;gates&#8221; or challenges he has to pass in order to complete the game. The &#8220;gate&#8221; I&#8217;m talking about in the final dungeon is a switch. The switch is visible in plain sight, but when I got there I had no idea how to turn it on. The usual action of just stepping on it didn&#8217;t work, I tried throwing various stuff or casting spells on it, but no such luck. I actually set aside the game for a few days because I couldn&#8217;t figure out that switch.

I actually needed It turns out I need to perform a particulat air-based attack to hit the switch from a jump. Normally this would be fine, except that the game has never required me to use that particular move anywhere else! It was taught in a short tutorial near the start of the game, but I&#8217;ve never used it after that so I even forgot it existed. It&#8217;s a bit disappointing because elsewhere the game does a great job of &#8220;teaching&#8221; you how to use the various actions as required.

The second gripe is a bit related: there are some platforms that require a particular camera angle in order for you to see how to proceed, and it&#8217;s not always clear how to get there. You end up walking to different positions to try and figure out how to get past the &#8220;gate&#8221;. In general in RPG design I think that whenever the player is forced to figure something out by trial and error it&#8217;s kind of lame and bad design.

These problems are mostly confined to the last dungeon of the game though, most of the time I just breezed through. The story mode will take about ten hours to complete, assuming decent platforming skills. THis may seem a bit short to the average RPG player who grew up with Final Fantasy VII, but it&#8217;s actually a nice bite-sized helping for guys like me who don&#8217;t have much time to dedicate to gaming and want to get on to the next game as soon as possible.

I give FFCC:RoF 3.5 out of 5 stars, decent enough. What? I don&#8217;t give ratings here? Right.

From what I'd seen, I'd say it may also be a spiritual successor to Brave
  
Fencer Musashi on the PS. Now that game needs a sequel.

Actually, it did have a sequel. There was a Musashi game on the PS2.
