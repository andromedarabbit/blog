The GPT was today: Sunday, 25-May-2008 as Robinson&#8217;s Galleria.

I&#8217;m sad that the GPTs are all scheduled on Sundays.

The deck I brought:

I felt unsure bringing in this deck (or any other deck actually). I&#8217;m walking into a tournament again with no playtesting, so it&#8217;s almost sure to bite me in the ass. Still, it&#8217;s a solid choice; hopefully I could just make some skill matter. I probably should have splashed white for some removal, but I didn&#8217;t have time to gather Crib Swaps.

**
    
Round 1: 1-2 Loss vs Monowhite/Kithkin:
   
** 

Not a good start. All three games were close races decided by his Thistledown Liege; if I actually did have white and Crib Swaps, they would have been awesome here. I also made the mistake of not boarding in Cloudthresher to handle the Spirit tokens off Spectral Procession, since the Liege makes them a powerful clock. Ironic, since I was winning using the same combo in the draft yesterday.

**
    
Round 2: 2-0 win vs Red Black:
   
** 

No surprise here, the matchup is probably something like 90-10 in my favor. In the second game, he played Countryside Crusher off one mountain and two Reflecting Pools. I played, in succession: Oversoul of Dusk (stops the Crusher), Primal Command (bounce mountain to top and search for second Oversoul), Oversoul of Dusk. At that point, his deck had no point of recovery.

**
    
Round 3: 1-2 loss vs Green/white/black:
   
** 

His deck is the same as mine, except with more removal. Skill came into play here, but sadly it was my lack of skill Game one was close, but I lost game two to a 4/4 indestructible Vanquisher that suddenly became 7/1 courtesy of Nameless Inversion. I could have blocked the Vanquisher for at least two more turns; I knew he had the Inversion in hand (he revealed it for the Vanquisher) when he attacked with me at six life, still I said &#8220;take.&#8221; =( Checking the top cards of my library afterwards, I might have won in two more turns, since he was at one life with no fliers and I was going to draw the Shield.

**
    
Final Record: 1-2-Drop
   
** 

Sigh. Despite doing well in drafts, I&#8217;m on a bad streak constructed-wise. At least the deck is definitely better in block compared to standard; no real bad matchups as far as I can tell. The games I lost were winnable games this time, instead of lopsided matchups. The difference lies in playing skill. Since I still don&#8217;t have time to playtest, there&#8217;s not much to do but to be more careful in making my decisions.

Next week: Probably nothing, as I can&#8217;t play in GPT II due to another appointment.
