Never give out any of your confidential usernames and passwords to programs or services that you do not trust completely. This may be a bit obvious to the more tech-savvy, but everybody has to watch out. Luckily, there are even some programmers who are able to catch the work of evil programmers.

Coding Horror has this story about an evil programmer who sold a GMail backup solution that steals your username and password.

The offending account was reported to Google, but I hope someone brings legal measures against the company who made and/or distributed the evil software.
