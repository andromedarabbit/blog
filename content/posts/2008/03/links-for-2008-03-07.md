because of this link i bought a pirated copy of the movie. was on maternity
  
leave when the movie came out e.

i think i liked the ending in the movie better because it seems conflicting to
  
the villain's character to have compassion.

I'm a bit ambivalent actually, either ending works for me. The ending in the
  
book sounds way better though.
