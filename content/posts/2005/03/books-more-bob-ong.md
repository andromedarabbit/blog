A while back I blogged aboutÂ [Bob Ong&#8217;s first book][1]. A short while after, I also picked up his next two books,Â _Bakit Baliktad Magbasa ng Libro Ang Mga Pilipino?Â _(Why Do Filipinos Read Backwards?) andÂ _Ang Paboritong Libro ni HudasÂ _(Judas&#8217; Favorite Book).

&#8220;Bakit Baligtad&#8221; focuses on the Philippines, its people, its quirks and its problems. &#8220;Paboritong Libro&#8221; is a lot harder to classify, as it jumps across several topics, with the unifying theme being the chapters named after anagrams of the seven deadly sins. At least I think that&#8217;s the unifying theme&#8230;

&#8220;Paboritong Libro&#8221; is also the better of the two books. Or at least the easier read, as &#8220;Bakit Baligtad&#8221; had a tendency to be a lot more serious and preachy, which might turn off people looking for a light read. Also, &#8220;Bakit Baligtad&#8221; contains a significant amount of non-original material, from theÂ [apparently-now-defunct Bobong Pinoy websiteÂ ][2]and from several online forums.

In fact, after reading &#8220;Bakit Baligtad&#8221;, I realized the particular appeal of Bob Ong&#8217;s books&#8230;all of them, including the first one, read like they were written on the internet. Maybe in a blog or something. Each book is like some sort of running commentary on some part of life in general; (the first book was about education, the second about the Philippines; I&#8217;m still not sure what the third book was about) That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so hard to pin down, it leaves you with that internet feeling of &#8220;hey-when&#8217;s-the-next-update?&#8221;

Both books are generally hit-or-miss though, with a bit more hit than miss, same as the first one. Some good parts, some you&#8217;d want to sleep through. They&#8217;re good for the price they&#8217;re at. In any case, I&#8217;ll probably pick up his next book as an impulse buy if I see it.

My favorite part of these two books (I&#8217;m not sure which book it was in anymore) was a list of amusing signs found all over the Philippines. One of them is described as such:Â [on a cracked lopsided wall along Libis, QC: Danger Wall is Falling!
  
][3] 

Hehe, that cracks me up, and I&#8217;m not sure why. I&#8217;d like to see that wall.

I should grab a copy of some of his books. I have always wanted to read some
  
of them. Oh well.

Would you lend them to me?! ðŸ˜‰

Sure, I don't mind, but how would I get them to you? They're really

cheap though. I bought all three as impulse buys.

Good question!

Hmmm. Do you still hang out at UP? I go there sometimes to see Mario and
  
incidentally Dave too.

Unfortunately, I don't think I've been to UP since I started working.

Work has this bad habit of eating up free time. If it didn't pay so well, I
  
wouldn't work at all!

Well, true&#8230; \*sigh\* Working is something that eats up a lot of people's times
  
and energies.
