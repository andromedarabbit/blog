I seem to be slightly more alert in the morning and a bit more agressive throughout the day with less sleep (around 6 hours). Taking eight or more hours of sleep seems to leave me slightly laid-back for the rest of the day. I&#8217;m trying to be more aware of my sleep dependencies, as I&#8217;m probably going to have to work 12-hour days for a while (maybe up to the end of April) :(
