Sorry about the title. I couldn&#8217;t find any succinct way to put it.

Anyway, yeah. I&#8217;m supposed to be trying to get a phone. People have been harassing me for years about the fact that I don&#8217;t have a phone. Since my vacation is already half-wasted already, I figure I&#8217;d go online and get some info on what phone I&#8217;d buy.

Now, bear with me a bit, I&#8217;m really stupid when it comes to phones, since I&#8217;ve practically never owned one. If there&#8217;s any better way or better place to look for the info than the way I describe here, tell me about it. ðŸ˜€

First, to find out what are the available phones and their features, I check the website of one of the major providers to see what handsets they list, since supposedly this tells me what models are available locally. FYI, I chose to use
   
[
    
Smart&#8217;s website
   
][1] 

Now, this helps me find phones which have features I like. But the Smart website only gives me prices offered by Smart when the phone is tied to one of their plans. Let&#8217;s assume I want a bit more flexibility and don&#8217;t want to be tied to the plan. I have no idea where to check the prices though, so I hit two auction sites instead:
   
[
    
ebili
   
][2] 
   
and
   
[
    
bidshot
   
][3] 
   
, so I can get some idea what people are willing to pay for these models.

Easy enough right? Check the features, cross-check the prices, choose a phone. Some notes on these websites:

Smart: Why the hell is the list of phones not sorted in any logical order? None that I can see anyway. When I see a cheap, er, reasonably-priced phone on the auction sites, I want to check the features of that phone on the Smart website but it takes me a while to find it. Some sort of search feature would have been nice. (Or maybe there is one and I missed it?)

Ebili/Bidshot: Why the hell is the search result list not sortable in any way? If you have a grid of search results, I don&#8217;t see how difficult it is to implement sortable columns; every single webapp I&#8217;ve worked on has this feature! I was almost tempted to send them an email offering my services as a freelancer to implement reasonable searching features such as sorting and filtering. These are NOT difficult things to implement, I don&#8217;t know why we don&#8217;t see them in all websites; I can understand the performance concern if you&#8217;re potentially returning millions of hits (i.e. Google), but these searches have hits ranging in dozens, sorting performance hit should be minimal.

That is all, just wanted to rant. And no, I have not chosen a phone yet.
