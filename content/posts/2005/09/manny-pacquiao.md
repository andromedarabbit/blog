I saw an interview with Manny Pacquiao on Rated K, apparently after his celebrated win last Sunday. Korina referred to him as a millionaire because of his share from the match, but Manny said he&#8217;s going to be giving a lot of it away. People told him to donate to Katrina, but he says there are also a lot of needy people in his own country so he&#8217;s giving to them first. He&#8217;s giving away food and stuff to poor people in his hometown.

Man, that guy&#8217;s got heart. No wonder he&#8217;s a local hero.
