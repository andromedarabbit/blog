One of the things I&#8217;ve been wanting to do during this hiatus was to watch more movies &#8212; we&#8217;ve got a ton of DVDs downstairs I haven&#8217;t seen yet. Since I had just finished theÂ [fifth book of Stephen King&#8217;s western fantasy][1], I started this task with Sergio Leone&#8217;s western opus, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.

I haven&#8217;t watched many westerns before. This is probably the first one I completed. And you know what it reminds me of? Dragonball. Ages of staring at each other, hands hovering over your guns, ending in two seconds of gunfire. I know they&#8217;re a lot more speak-y in Dragonball, but it gave me the same feeling&#8230;the anticipative build-up and the big, explosive finish.

God, that was a long movie. I think it clocked in at 2:45 or so. It was mistake to watch this movie in late afternoon, as I started getting drowsy towards the end.

I&#8217;ve never seen Clint Eastwood this young before! But he reminds me of how I usually visualize Roland of Gilead. And the impossibly good shooting in the movie seems characteristic of Roland&#8217;s gunslingers as well.

Good movie, though longish.
