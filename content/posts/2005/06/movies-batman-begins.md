Awesome. Definitely better than the all the other Batman movies. This movie is no kids&#8217; movie either. The movie is less about Batman&#8217;s crimefighting adventures and more about Bruce Wayne&#8217;s journey from being a angry, confused rich orphan to the billionaire playboy/costumed vigilante popularized by the earlier films.

The movie captures the essence of Batman&#8217;s character perfectly. It&#8217;s all about fear &#8212; Bruce overcoming his fear of bats and eventually turning that fear into a symbol to strike terror into the hearts of criminals. The Batman here is nowhere near Joel Schumacher&#8217;s colorful crusader, or Adam West&#8217;s \*Biff\*Pow\*Sock\* type of action. This Batman is a true dark knight, striking from the shadows, unseen, terrifying. I can just imagine the rumors rippling through the underworld during the movie: the Batman is a terrifying monster; he can fly; he can command bats; he is darkness incarnate.

The two villains that appear in the movie &#8211; Ra&#8217;s Al Ghul and Scarecrow &#8211; complement the general fear and deception theme of the movie. Jim Gordon&#8217;s character is great, although it&#8217;s a bit weird for me to see Gary Oldman in the role. As for Katie Holmes, well, her character didn&#8217;t seem to have an important enough role from my point of view. Michael Kaine is a worthy Alfred Pennyworth, and this Alfred seems a bit more smartass than those that appeared in the earlier movies.

All in all, worth the watch. The tantalizing hint at the end of the movie suggests a sequel, but the question is, who will play the Joker?

Also, we watched in the new cinemas at SM North. Nice, everything seems a lot roomier and the seats were comfy. I didn&#8217;t get to see what the comfort rooms were like as the movie had me glued to my seat.
