<div>
  i don&#8217;t always know the right words to say,<br /> i don&#8217;t always know the right thing to do,<br /> there&#8217;s just one thing i&#8217;m sure of,<br /> i only want to be with you
</div>

<div>
  i&#8217;ll be here waiting,<br /> standing by you every day<br /> hoping your heart will take notice<br /> and send a smile my way
