<div>
  sometimes i just feel<br /> so out of my world<br /> an ordinary guy in love<br /> with an extraordinary girl
</div>

&nbsp;

<div>
</div>

&nbsp;

<div>
  i don't always know the right words to say,<br /> i don't always know the right thing to do,<br /> there's just one thing i'm sure of,<br /> i only want to be with you
</div>

&nbsp;

<div>
  i'll be here waiting,<br /> standing by you every day<br /> hoping your heart will take notice<br /> and send a smile my way
</div>
