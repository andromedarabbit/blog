Currently listening to &#8220;Boulevard of Broken Songs&#8221;, a neat mashup mainly of Green Day&#8217;s &#8220;Boulevard of Broken Dreams&#8221; and Oasis&#8217; &#8220;Wonderwall&#8221;. This and some other mashups [here.
  
][1] 
  
(haven&#8217;t listened to the others though&#8230;)

Another interesting mashup that came out quite a while back was [&#8220;This Is How You Remind Me Someday&#8221; ][2], where Nickelback is caught basically reusing the same chords for two songs. Great stuff.

Other songs/bands I&#8217;ve been listening to lately:

Locally, Spongecola is hot. Their album has several good tracks (since I don&#8217;t listen to radio, I&#8217;m not sure which of them are popular or not.) My favorites are &#8220;Jeepney&#8221;, &#8220;Lunes&#8221;, &#8220;22&#8221;, &#8220;Partisan&#8221;, &#8220;Dragonfly&#8221;, &#8220;Jillian&#8221; and &#8220;KLSP&#8221;&#8230;um, I&#8217;m pretty close to naming the whole album :p. They also have this great live rendition of Madonna&#8217;s &#8220;Crazy For You&#8221; going around.

Sugarfree&#8217;s last album is also heavy on my playlist &#8211; I think their &#8220;Hari ng Sablay&#8221; has been getting some serious airplay. My favorite Sugarfree track is from their first album though &#8211; it&#8217;s &#8220;Burnout&#8221;.

Of course there&#8217;s Rivermaya&#8217;s new single &#8220;You&#8217;ll Be Safe Here&#8221;. Pretty good, Rico Blanco is really good with the lyrics.

For live performances, I posted a link to the [AlphaQuam Live Music Archive ][3]on [delicious ][4]a while back. They have this great performance of &#8220;Careless Whisper&#8221; by Ben Folds and Rufus Wainwright. If you want more rock-type sounds, try Vertical Horizon&#8217;s live rendition of &#8220;You&#8217;re A God&#8221;, complete with Top Gun intro.

Oh, and one song that&#8217;s been on LSS for me all day: &#8220;King of Pain&#8221; by Sting. Not sure why.
