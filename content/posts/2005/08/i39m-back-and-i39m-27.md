Yeah, so there.

It was an impromptu hiatus anyway. Unplanned and whatever. Work has been hell lately. Not a tedious kind of hell though. Just the sort that sucks up a lot of time. I spent more than 15 hours in the office on my birthday.

Twenty-seven huh? I wish I had more to say, but birthdays seem to matter less and less as I get older. I&#8217;m in a good place right now, but I&#8217;m still not where I ultimately want to be. I have a long road ahead of me.

Maybe someday I&#8217;ll get around to it.
