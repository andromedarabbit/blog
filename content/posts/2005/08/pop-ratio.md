I&#8217;ve known of Markku Seguerra&#8217;s [rebelpixel][1] website for a while, having enjoyed his constant stream of [OPM-friendly lyrics section][2].

Today, I came upon [his blog post][3] about his band with some Pisay 96 batchmates. Their band is Pop Ratio, and he&#8217;s made available some original tracks and also some covers on his website. They&#8217;re pretty okay, you might want to listen to a few.

I know some of my own batchmates are active in bands, I wonder if I can get any (free) samples of their music?

There used to be a site (i forget now) where Popgun used to have some track
  
on. I have them, if you want.

BTW, Popgun has already disbanded, apparently. Rocky has a band called The
  
Haneps, and Nico and Monsi are with Ryan in Tsubibo.
