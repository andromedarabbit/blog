title: The Left Half of My Mouth is Numb, Thanks

I had three teeth taken out today, all of them deep in the bottom-left part of mouth. One of them was apparently a wisdom tooth that had lodged itself in a peculiar angle. That one required surgery (and was not covered by my health card).

When you&'re there, even when your mouth is numb, even if you&'re not really scared or anything, once you start to feel that pressure on your jaw, you can&'t help but be at least a little bit anxious. It&'s not so much whatever pain gets through the anesthesia that&'s annoying. It&'s the fact that you&'re mentally anticipating that pain. When you start to feel the dentist pushing and pulling at your tooth, you can&'t help but worry that somewhere, some resilient little nerve of yours has avoided the anesthesia and is just waiting to send you into a world of pain.

Luckily, not only is my dentist very good, but I&'m quite comfortable with her, despite the often corniness of her jokes :p

Ouch. Usually the wisdom teeth are taken out \_one\_ at a time.

It's a good thing you had the weird-angle one removed, though. Over time it
  
would probably have caused fractures in the rest of your teeth.

P.S.: No word verification option for comments? ðŸ™‚

You misunderstand, I only had one wisdom tooth taken out; the rest were just
  
there and ripe for the picking :p

And yeah, no word verification. I don't think I get enough hits for me to be
  
comment-spam worthy :p
