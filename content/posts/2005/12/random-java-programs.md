So, my brother needed to present 20 java programs for school. He didn&#8217;t have to make them himself, he said. Just to print them out and submit them. (What kind of ridiculous compsci teacher asks for hardcopies of source instead of softcopies?)

Anyway, I said, sure. I&#8217;ll make some, it&#8217;ll be easy. After all, trivial programs shouldn&#8217;t take me more than 5 minutes each right? It was true, each one didn&#8217;t take long. But I spent quite some time thinking about what I would actually code. The usual suspects are there &#8211; Hello World, prime factors, factorial, simple arithmetic, palindromes. It was just harder than I thought making up twenty diverse trivial java programs to write. I&#8217;m not a teacher after all :p

Anyway, in case someone in the world finds these examples useful:
