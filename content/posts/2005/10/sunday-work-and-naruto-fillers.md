I have to work today üôÅ And probably tomorrow and the day after as well, although both are local holidays.

On what may very well become one of the company&#8217;s biggest projects I might add, if we get the contract.

On an unrelated note, these filler Naruto episodes are just silly. It doesn&#8217;t make sense that Raiga, one of the Seven Shinobi Swordsmen, can be defeated by Naruto and Lee (no matter how drunk Lee is); Raiga is supposedly on par with his former comrade Kisame, who was easily able to take on two of Konoha&#8217;s jounins. There should be a big gap in power levels.

And what&#8217;s up with Lee and Naruto pretty much shock-resistant?
