I&#8217;m never really sure.

I woke up this morning with a slight headache, compounding my annoying cough and colds. I&#8217;m sure I would have been able to make it to work and put on a whole day&#8217;s work, albeit probably at a less productive level. But then again, if I rest today, I may be able to put in a 110% productive day tomorrow, whereas not resting might cause me to be unproductive for more than one day.
