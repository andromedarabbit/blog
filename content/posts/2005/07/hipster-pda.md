Should I get a [Hipster PDA][1]? I&'m thinking about it. Or something similar.

Not really for organizing tasks and stuff. Only for jotting down temporary things when away from a computer. So I can remember them later. I often think up incredibly clever world-shaking ideas while commuting, it would be nice to remember all of them.

I still largely prefer the advantages of electronic storage: cut/paste functionality, easy to make backups/copies, distribution, easily searchable etc. I&'d really only use paper for temporary stuff. Or when I need to use a pen to think.

A notepad would be nice. You know, like the ones reporters used to carry around.
