Wordpress host &#8211; free blog
  
][1] 

I&#8217;ve wanted to try WordPress for a while now, but not having easy access to a PHP-enabled server of my own, I haven&#8217;t had the chance.

Blogsome is a new, free service that provides WordPress for blogging. I signed up, and roy.blogsome.com was still available (nothing there, don&#8217;t bother looking)

Am I going to leave blogger? I don&#8217;t know, really, I&#8217;m already pretty comfortable with it already, and moving to WordPress means learning a while new templating language (I know it would take all of an hour to get it down, but still&#8230;inertia).

I&#8217;m definitely not moving to Blogsome right now though, as there is currently no way to use WordPress&#8217; import from Blogger feature with Blogsome since they do not provide FTP uploads for you. My other issue is that since everything would be hosted on Blogsome servers, there&#8217;s a lot less control than with Blogger.

As far as I&#8217;m concerned, WordPress has only one thing which Blogger still does not have: categories. If you&#8217;re anything like me and you like to pretend to be organized, categories are a big step towards that. I have no doubt that Blogger will eventually have categories sometime in the feature, but right now they&#8217;re having trouble keeping their existing features from the hiccups.

Ah, if only I got could get some free/cheap webhosting with a significant amount of space and JSP/Tomcat support. Since I use mostly JSP/Java at work, this is best for me&#8230;PHP means having to learn a whole new language, and we&#8217;ve been over that.
