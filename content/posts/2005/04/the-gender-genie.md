The Gender Genie
  
][1] 

Apparently, according to this handy web tool, I write like a girl, or at least I do when my posts exceed 500 words. How embarassing! Apparently I should be using more masculine words like &#8220;the&#8221;, &#8220;good&#8221; and &#8220;something&#8221; rather than feminine words like &#8220;but&#8221; and &#8220;actually&#8221;!

Noted!
