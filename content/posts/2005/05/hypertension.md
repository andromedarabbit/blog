Yeah, so I guess I&#8217;m hypertensive. I get dizzy occasionally, and today I decided to pass by the Clinic to consult about it. My BP reading was a 150/110! The highest reading I&#8217;ve had, ever. I hope it&#8217;s not too serious though. Will find out soon.

I don&#8217;t really mind not being 100% healthy, and taking maintenance medicine could hurt a bit in the pocket (although I don&#8217;t care much for money) What I don&#8217;t like about not being healthy isÂ [the diet][1]. How can I do without my wonderful salty spam?

good luck with the low salt and take care of yourself.

No, it's probably just me and my unhealthy lifestyle. :p

hay&#8230;I'm sure I'll beat this thing, since I'm invincible or something. But
  
I'd have to eat a lot of veggies to do it. :(
