Pimp My RigÂ ][1]is a hardware review side associated with a friend of mine from high school. Yes, I was asked to help promote it. ðŸ˜€

I haven&#8217;t worried about hardware issues in a while, since I usually ask my kid brother to handle most hardware purchases/setup at home. So, I don&#8217;t really know much about the latest and greatest hardware but this site looks helpful enough to be given a try, especially if you&#8217;re the sort who enjoys putting together his own PC. Check it out.

On an unrelated note, whenever I try to type the word &#8220;rig&#8221;, I find myself unconsciously typing &#8220;right.&#8221; Deep inside, I don&#8217;t think I accept &#8220;rig&#8221; as a word. :p
