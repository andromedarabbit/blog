Haven&#8217;t read Robert Jordan in a while. Someone gave me Crossroads of Twilight as a gift, so I read it and hope that his pacing has improved. It has not. He writes well enough, dialogue is nice, descriptions are more than adequate, but I expect some things to happen in his books! He has so many plots running at once, he should at least resolve two or three per book. Perrin, Mat and Elayne get a lot of chapters, but they barely get anything done. Rand al&#8217;Thor himself barely gets one chapter, and I&#8217;m thinking it was just put in &#8217;cause people would be pissed if he didn&#8217;t actually appear in the book. Egwene at least had the good sense to go out and try to do something. Not that she got anywhere sensible of course&#8230;

I swear, with so many things going on, it will take him forever to wrap up this series. And while that may be good for him, I wonder how many people will bother following the books for so long? Especially when they&#8217;re more of the same&#8230;
