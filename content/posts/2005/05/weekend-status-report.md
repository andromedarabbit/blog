I only had three tasks laid out for me this weekend:

1. Watch season 4 of X-men Evolution. I realize that X-men Evo was not as popular as some of the other superhero series such as Justice League and Teen Titans, but I mostly like it anyway. It&#8217;s more of a light-hearted version of the X-men universe , really. (Presidential hopeful Senator Kelly of canon is merely Mayoral hopeful Principal Kelly here!) It gets campy at times, but hey, Adam West&#8217;s Batman was the epitome of campiness, and I enjoyed that too. This task was successfully accomplished.

2. Fix the home network LAN. Previously we had a problem where the other computer could not use the internet through the gateway machine. Looks like ZoneAlarm was the culprit, as apparently, the free version of ZoneAlarm does not support Internet Connection Sharing. I got the internet working by installing Sygate Personal Firewall instead, although this led to the new problem of the other computer not being able to access shared files/folders on the network. We&#8217;re keeping it at this state until I can figure out a better solution. This task was successfully accomplished, with complications.

3. Solve this Rubik&#8217;s UFO puzzles (it is already solved in the picture):

Of course, instead of actually devising a solution to the puzzle, I merely used my google-fu to find aÂ [website to help me solve it][2].

All three tasks completed! (Mostly)

I also managed to sneak in a good part of Crossroads of Twilight (Book 10 of Wheel of Time, more on that in a later post), and two movies: Shrek 2 and the Incredibles. Yes, I had not seen either movie before. And actually, I didn&#8217;t see them in whole today either. I saw more than half of Incredibles, I think. And most of Shrek 2. Quick reviews, Shrek 2 was the better movie by far. Rib-tickling. I didn&#8217;t bother seeing it before because it didn&#8217;t really give me a feeling of being too good, but I was wrong.
