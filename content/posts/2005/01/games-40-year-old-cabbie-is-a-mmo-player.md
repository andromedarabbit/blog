Khan-fusion and a cabbie tale &#8211; INQ7.net
   
][1] 

Cool story on INQ7 about a 40-year old cab driver who plays popular MMORPGs here in the Philippines. Goes to show how well MMORPGs like Ragnarok, MU, etc. are doing locally. Even though they&#8217;re not considered &#8220;big&#8221; compared to American giants like Everquest and World of Warcraft, they&#8217;ve definitely captured the Pinoy market quite well.
