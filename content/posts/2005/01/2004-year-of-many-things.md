So the year 2004 has come and gone, never to be seen again, unless you look in the archives. This is my looking back/looking forward post, for the transition between 2004 and 2005, no more than eleven days late. (I&#8217;m part-Chinese, so I actually get to delay this until Chinese New Year, but I&#8217;m cool, so I&#8217;ll do it early.)

2004 Highlights
  
** 

In mostly chronological, but actually no particular, order:

  * I dared to fall in love, consequently got my heart broken. Am still in the same place, apparently.
  * I was able to go outside the country for the first time.
  * Bought a digital camera (and still no phone!)
  * Went to Bicol for the first time in eight years.
  * I passed the JITSE certification exam.
  * I got to read more.
  * I started to have health concerns.
  * Oh, and I&#8217;m not sure, but I may very well have pissed off my dentist.
  * I started taking this blog a bit more seriously. Added the comments thing, made it a bit more public. My favorite post of this year: [My Eyeglasses Belong to the Sea][1].

Seriously, I think I&#8217;ve changed a lot this past year. Especially due to the first entry above. Personally, I feel like I&#8217;ve broadened my horizons somewhat, I feel stronger, better as a person, more confident in myself. I&#8217;m a lot less antisocial now, and heaven forbid, I actually greet people in the office in the mornings and before I go home! Professionally, I feel like I&#8217;ve accomplished a lot as well. I learned a lot of new things; I&#8217;m a Web developer now, although my area of expertise is now apparently Oracle Reports; Participated in a lot more projects than I did in 2003, learned a lot of new stuff; Became a trainer for several batches of newbies (I think half the office calls me &#8216;Sir&#8217; now&#8230;); had my first ON, etc. All in all, a very productive/fruitful/exciting year was 2004.

And the future? What does 2005 hold for our brave not-so-young hero?

I tried thinking up some New Year&#8217;s resolutions, but, as many intelligent folk know, resolutions suck. Sure, they probably have some motivational value, but if you really know what you want, you shouldn&#8217;t need the end of an arbitrarily-decided calendar year to start. So, in lieu of resolutions, I present the following list of things-I-might-have-resolved-to-do:

  * Blog every day. This was a good idea, but I figured forcing yourself to do something regularly _just for the sake of it _was not a good thing. I&#8217;ll blog when I have something to say, thanks.
  * Learn to cook/bowl well. This sounds neat. But the real problem with me trying to learn new skills outside my comfort zone is that they tend to eat up goof-off time. But I _want _to learn new things. So, for this one, I&#8217;ll do &#8217;em if I can and I feel like it.
  * Learn PHP/mySQL and use dynamic stuff for this website. This is an easier proposition, since it&#8217;s something that falls well within one of my areas of interest (coding). However, I already code a lot at work, so I&#8217;m not really that motivated to code outside of work. I think I may be able to do this to some degree or other though.
  * Broaden my horizons. Do new things. Visit new places. This is a good idea. And I hope I can do it some. But I won&#8217;t resolve to do it.

That&#8217;s it I guess, let&#8217;s see what 2005 has in store for us. Bring it!
