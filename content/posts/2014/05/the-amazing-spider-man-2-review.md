Well, I haven&#8217;t written anything in a while, so I figured I&#8217;d write some words on the new Spider-Man movie. Spoilers abound!

**Action-packed!** The web-swinging is fun and looks and feels just like Spidey from the comic books. Spider-man moves and fights and banters pretty faithfully to the comic book version of our favorite wall-crawler, so that&#8217;s a definite plus. Peter&#8217;s Spider-sense is portrayed as a slow-motion bullet-time kind of deal which allows him to react quickly and save all the people while dodging everything. It doesn&#8217;t really translate exactly to the comic-book Spider-sense, but I suppose it&#8217;s better than having squiggly lines around his head.

**Peter Parker, haunted by&#8230;the ghost of Dennis Leary? **We get it, you&#8217;re breaking the promise you made at the end of the first movie and you&#8217;re putting Gwen in danger. What, did he become the physical embodiment of the Spider-sense? If I was Captain Stacy I&#8217;d haunt you too for stalking my daughter from the rooftops! Not even Uncle Ben haunted Peter like this!

**And the deep dark secret of Peter&#8217;s parents is&#8230;what, is that it?** Seriously, that was a lame reveal after all the drama at the start of the movie; it didn&#8217;t seem entirely too relevant and more like a subplot that didn&#8217;t go anywhere. The mysterious party who would&#8217;ve benefited from Oscorp experiments and was willing to hire an assassin to kill the parents on a plane was never elaborated on. Maybe it&#8217;s something they&#8217;ll explore in a future film, but for now it feels like they were just forced to create a link because of the mysterious disappearance of the parents from the first movie.

**Norman Osborn, Spider-man&#8217;s greatest enemy!** No? Decrepit old man on his deathbed? Dying of some weird goblinitis disease? Okay, at least Harry&#8217;s here, right?

**Harry Osborn, Spider-man&#8217;s best friend turned worst enemy!** Or at least we&#8217;re told they&#8217;re good friends, we just have to take their word for it. There they are joking like old pals for two minutes, surely we must be convinced they are best buds! BTW Pete, old-friend-of-mine-who-I-havent-had-contact-with-for-10-years-even-though-social-media-should-already-exist-at-this-time, can you get me some Spider-man blood? I&#8217;m dying brah

**Max Dillon! Electro!** Mild-mannered electrical engineer with low self-esteem who ignores safety procedures and gets bitten by radioactive electric eels! Seriously? I&#8217;m looking forward to the Sinister Six movie where Adrian Toomes gets bitten by a radioactive vulture. We get a high-power-level version of Electro here, he&#8217;s able to teleport around as electrical charges or something and he&#8217;s even able to magically generate underwear and later a bodysuit! But he&#8217;s no match for Peter Parker&#8217;s questionable movie science!

**Not enough villains? Let&#8217;s add the Rhino! **Well, just for a quick scene at the end to lead into the Sinister Six movie, maybe? A scene that we&#8217;ve already seen in the trailers too! I suppose it&#8217;s a blessing that they didn&#8217;t try to shoehorn a Rhino subplot, there&#8217;s already too much going on as it is.

**Oh no, two airplanes might collide because there&#8217;s no electricity! **How was this even relevant to Spider-man&#8217;s battle? It&#8217;s not like he knew what was going on at the airport!

**&#8220;You need me, I know the specs to the grid thingy!&#8221;** Uh, it turns out all you needed to do was know how to pick up a key from a dead guy&#8217;s hand and unlock a panel. And I thought her field was in biochemistry or something, not electrical engineering?

**I have to admit, the death at the end caught me off guard. **I knew it had to happen sooner or later, but given that they cut MJ out of this movie and had a subplot of Gwen flying off to England (which she did in the comics and she managed to come back to New York before the big deal at the bridge), I assumed it would be happening in the next film. Though by the time they had her falling from the tower, I would&#8217;ve been annoyed if they didn&#8217;t go through with it after the build-up. But now I&#8217;m worried that they&#8217;re going to rush the Peter-MJ relationship in the next movie the same way they rushed the Peter-Harry friendship in this one, since they didn&#8217;t get the chance to introduce MJ while Peter and Gwen were still a thing.

**Where&#8217;s the scene where the New Yorkers come together to help Spider-Man?** Isn&#8217;t this a franchise staple by now?

**End credits sequence teases the Sinister Six lineup. **Well, that was fine.

**Overall **plotting and pacing felt weird, with some scene transitions feeling like they could be better handled. The whole thing at the end with how Peter deals with Gwen&#8217;s fate felt weirdly out of place. They could&#8217;ve ended the second movie on a down note, and have Peter coming back strong in TASM3 (an Empire Strikes Back sort of thing), but no, they wanted to get the grieving out of the way quickly. Well, the movie was fun and enjoyable to watch, and had quite a few recognizable names for comic books fans (I&#8217;m sure all the comic readers noted the name of Harry&#8217;s assistant and Max&#8217;s boss), but all the nitpicky problems above pull the movie down especially when we just came back from the awesomeness that was Captain America: Winter Soldier.

Next: Days of Future Past!
