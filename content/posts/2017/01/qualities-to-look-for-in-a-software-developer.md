Just a list I&#8217;ve been maintaining for a while:

_(Disclaimer: This list in no way implies that developers who don&#8217;t exhibit all of these attributes are terrible human beings who don&#8217;t deserve to live. But working with developers who exhibit many of these traits will probably result in a better experience over the course of your developer career.)_
