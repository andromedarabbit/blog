I had [booked the Singapore trip][1] earlier in the year, since I almost always [attend Grand Prixs in Singapore][2] as its an easy trip and gives a good opportunity to visit friends. Unfortunately, I ended up not having time to prepare for the tournament itself. Fortunately, it was a limited event rather than constructed, so I figured maybe I could wing it and still do well. (Spoiler: I could not.)

Prior to the trip, my prep for the sealed format had consisted of a single pool at my prerelease and reading a few articles online the night before the trip. I went there on Day 0/Friday to try a last chance trial, but didn&#8217;t get past the first round due to a &#8220;I&#8217;m still testing&#8221; mentality that meant poor mulligans and not reading the cards and tilting and scooping before figuring out there was an alternative.

Later that night, we opened 6 different sealed pools and tried out a few different builds to get a feel for the format. I liked the B/W vampires archetype best, and felt that the format was aggressive and wanted to avoid dinosaur decks which would have too many high-end drops. (Spoilers: Dinosaur decks would be my undoing). I knew I wanted to open cards like Bishop&#8217;s Soldier, Mark of the Vampire, Walk the Plank, Vanquish the Weak, Ixalan&#8217;s Binding and so on.

We ended our night prep with a few simple guidelines for the next day:

  1. Read the cards
  2. Mulligan well
  3. Think before scooping
  4. Life is unfair

Main event time: Amazingly, the judges had pre-registered all the sealed pools. I was happy to note as I opened my pool that I had opened many of the cards I wanted to see. I had a secondary R/G dino list that seemed workable but lacking a few playables. I just went with B/W aggro since that&#8217;s what I was confident with. Here&#8217;s the build I went with:

I was pretty happy with the pool and thought I could do well. The deck looked good, if a bit lacking in two drops. To the swiss!

First 3 rounds: WIN. Aggro deck works as expected. Feels good to get a good GP start.

Round 4: LOSS vs B/W. The guy I fought here eventually finished Day 1 undefeated, so I guess he had a pretty good pool anyway. I was saddened by the early loss, but there was still much to give.

Round 5: Win. Hooray, we are back on track. Or so I thought.

Round 6: Loss vs B/G dinosaurs and removal. Ok, guy had a really solid pool and I tilted a bit, that&#8217;s fine. 7-2 for Day one was still doable and a perfectly decent finish.

Round 7: Loss vs R/G dinos. Ugh. Now I see the problem with not having enough two drops. Not able to push through enough early damage means the opponent stabilizes. Mana problems at 16 lands doesn&#8217;t help either. No more losses to give after this one.

Round 8: Loss vs R/G dinos again. Similar story as the last round. I message my friend who had gone home earlier. &#8220;Good news! I don&#8217;t have to come in early tomorrow!&#8221; Sigh.

Round 9: Playing just for fun now. Aaand I lose a very close game 3 to another B/W deck.

Oh well, that&#8217;s Ixalan limited for me then. The next set drops early January so I&#8217;m not playing this format again. The good news is, even if you scrub out on day one, there&#8217;s always Chaos Sealed to look forward to on Day Two!

**Chaos Sealed**

Chaos Sealed was pricey since we get two Masters boosters this time. Here are the ones I pulled:

[<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2505" src="http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_20171217_142111.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1152" srcset="https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_20171217_142111.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_20171217_142111-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_20171217_142111-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_20171217_142111-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG_20171217_142111-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px" />][4]

Yup, everyone got an _Unstable_. And yup, I sadly got a _Coldsnap_. I built a red/blue deck with green and black splashes. Mostly just fliers and tempo and removal. Most expensive pull was a Verdant Catacombs from the _MM2017_. I did use a few _Unstable_ cards, just removal and some solid creatures. None of that contraption silliness, though I did have the opportunity to lose to one later on. I also had a foil Terminate that happened to be by the GP artist so I managed to get it signed.

I won the first 3 rounds on the back of my fliers, then lost round 4 to a mildly annoying Chinese person, then did an ID with the 5th round opponent. Got enough points for like 5/6ths of an Ixalan box. I actually wanted to get a GP shirt, but they were out of XXXLs. At least I managed to win something for the weekend so it wasn&#8217;t a total wash.

I&#8217;m a bit sad about not performing well in both GPs I attended this year, and as always it makes me think about quitting competitive Magic completely. It requires a lot of time and effort to keep up and be familiar with the metagame. In fact, I had already decided to skip the Standard GP in Singapore next June. (This will be the first GP Singapore that I would have missed since 2010). I&#8217;ll probably stick to Modern mostly for the near future.
