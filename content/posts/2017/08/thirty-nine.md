I haven&#8217;t had much time to write recently. Been busy. (I&#8217;ll write about that some other time.) But I&#8217;ve kind of been posting regularly on this date for a while, so here we are.

Ah, time. And the inexorable passage thereof. There&#8217;s some kind of big milestone for me in around three hundred and sixty-five more solar cycles. Well, I don&#8217;t personally consider it big, since that&#8217;s kind of arbitrary. But as people are wont to say, life begins&#8230; maybe I&#8217;ll save that for next year.

This year, kind of at a crossroads. Considering where to go and the way forward. Trying out some things. Figuring out what&#8217;s important and what&#8217;s not and what one would be willing to give up.

In all honesty there&#8217;s a good chance that in another year&#8217;s time, I still wouldn&#8217;t have figured anything out. Maybe that&#8217;s what life is though. A constant struggle of figuring out where to go next.

And so it goes.
