For years now, I&#8217;ve had numerous discussions with friends and family about the possibility of setting up my own business, no matter how small. Prospects have ranged from my own software consulting firm to a food stall in an MRT station. None of these ideas never push through. Aside from general risk-aversion and not being confident in the ideas, there&#8217;s a few factors that in my mind are significant obstacles towards starting a new business for me.

**Government red tape and paperwork**

I have a friend who manages a small business for his family, as he&#8217;s often ranting about the situation here in the Philippines, about how there&#8217;s always a lot of filing requirements, many of which don&#8217;t make sense and are seemingly designed to make it easier for unscrupulous employees to bilk you for money. A direct quote: &#8220;It is literally easier to cheat on taxes and filing requirements via connections/bribery than it is to make a good faith effort to follow regulations.&#8221; This is not something I would want to deal with.

**Hiring other people**

A while back I was discussing with someone the prospect of setting up a food stall franchise somewhere. They offered an affordable package and assistance, but I balked at the idea that I would have to find and hire someone to man the stall myself. I have enough trouble delegating my work to other people when I&#8217;m in a team of competent engineers. I find the idea of entrusting an entire store or stall in which I invested hard-earned money unnerving. I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d be able to properly identify someone trustworthy enough that I can leave them alone to handle such things.

**Marketing and Sales**

With my background as an engineer, I&#8217;m not too fond of marketing and sales. However, I have spent the last couple of years working with a small startup, where I had a lot more visibility into the overall business process, so I guess I have a slightly better appreciation of marketing and sales now. These skills are largely focused on manipulating humans, whereas my own skillset is largely focused on manipulating computers. It doesn&#8217;t help that a lot of marketing techniques and sales methods feel very &#8220;scummy&#8221; to me, like clickbait ads and so on. I know these can be done well and in ways that conform with my own personal code of honour, but still, in my head these skills constitute &#8220;black arts&#8221; and &#8220;necessary evils.&#8221; 

All of these are hurdles I&#8217;d have to overcome if I ever really want to start a business. That, or I&#8217;d have to find business partners willing to handle all this drudge work for me so that I can focus on the parts I enjoy &#8211; engineering and problem solving and implementation. Until then, I&#8217;ll have to content myself with working as an independent consultant.
