I realise it&#8217;s a bit weird for me to be reviewing a marketing book, given my self-proclaimed aversion to marketing and sales. A while back I wrote a [review for Tim Ferris&#8217; book Tribe of Mentors][1] on this blog, and for some reason someone decided to contact me citing this review and asked if I would review this other book and they would give me a complimentary copy. This was something new to me, so I thought I&#8217;d try it out! (I guess this a thing I do know. Feel free to send me books on random topics to review!)

Anyway, on to the book: It&#8217;s relatively short, it only took me a while to get through it because of general busy-ness. Coming from someone who doesn&#8217;t have much experience in marketing and sales, I think the book gives a decent overview of this space. I have some prior informal knowledge of many of these concepts, but it&#8217;s nice to have a more structured idea of how the general flow of marketing works. 

I find a lot of modern marketing techniques distasteful. I&#8217;m not especially fond of people aggressively push-marketing to me via cold calls or pushing flyers in my face. To the book&#8217;s credit, it points out that such blind-shotgun techniques are wildly ineffective. And while it doesn&#8217;t go into too much detail about each particular area, I think having a more solid understanding of modern marketing techniques and mentalities will help me &#8220;understand the enemy&#8221; better, so to speak.

As to the 1-page marketing plan itself: I don&#8217;t have enough marketing knowledge to say whether it&#8217;s really an innovation in implementation as the author claims, but it seems like a reasonable checklist for a business to consider when planning out their marketing activities. If I ever manage to talk myself into starting a business, the overview given by this book would certainly be useful. The book itself isn&#8217;t very expensive, so I think it&#8217;s a reasonable buy for someone new to the marketing space.
