I&'ve been re-watching The Office (US) lately (it&'s a good show to leave running in the background while you&'re doing other stuff), and I just find the character of Michael Scott fascinating. He&'s funny and well-written and basically just a big bag of human flaws that somehow bumbles his way into managing an office. He&'s self-centered, attention-hungry, easily distracted, and refuses to acknowledge any bad news, yet despite all of that he loves his workmates like a family.

The thing I find most relatable is his complete self-confidence that he can be good at everything. Not just his job as a manager and as a salesman, but everything he chooses to do. As an example, he auditioned for a play (_The Demon Barber of Fleet Street)_ and automatically assumed he was getting a part. He also made a movie which fell into the so-bad-its-good category (_Threat Level Midnight_) and was pissed off that his girlfriend didn&'t care much for it. He also claims to have written a business book and an HBO comedy special.

I find the above relatable because I have this similar flaw of wanting to do everything and yet feel bad when I fall short. Like Michael Scott, I often don&'t have the patience for grinding through the beginner stages of some new thing I&'m trying out &#8211; it&'s something I&'m working on improving. I&'m sure both Michael Scott and I could stand to learn from _Adventure Time_&#8216;s Finn the Dog:
