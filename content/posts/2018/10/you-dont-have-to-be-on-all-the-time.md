Reminders:

  * You don&#8217;t have to be on all the time.
  * You don&#8217;t have to optimize everything all the time
  * You don&#8217;t have to be at maximum productivity all the time
  * You don&#8217;t have to be the best at everything you do all the time
  * You don&#8217;t have to be the smartest person in the room all the time
  * You don&#8217;t have to worry about everything all the time
  * You don&#8217;t have to be strong enough for everyone all the time
  * You don&#8217;t have to solve everyone&#8217;s problems all the time

There had been some suggestion that people with the above traits (hypercompetitive, always wanting to optimize everything, manage their time, be productive etc) have a [higher tendency for heart disease or cardiovascular problems][1], although that theory is in question. For sure though, the so-called Type A behavior makes one more vulnerable to stress and/or burnout.
