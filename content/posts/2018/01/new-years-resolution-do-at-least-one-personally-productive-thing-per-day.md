I&#8217;m not super big on New Year&#8217;s Resolutions anymore. (I seldom even do the 1920&#215;1440 joke these days.) I mean, I&#8217;m all about productivity and improvement and changing for the better, but I&#8217;ve found that very specific resolutions don&#8217;t often work for me. Mostly because I have very little focus (obviously something that an be improved).

{{< tweet 682613316246585344 >}}

So my tendency now is to stick to general, high level resolutions (like the above) that don&#8217;t go into anything too specific. And so this year I decided on something like that. My NYR for this year is: Do at least one personally productive thing per day.

By _personally,_ I mean something outside of work, something I do for myself. By _productive_, I mean something that helps me improve or grow or live a better life in some manner. And this excludes any manner of consumption (reading, eating, watching TV, browsing reddit, playing games, etc)

So yes, it&#8217;s still kind of vague, but my intent is to minimize or even completely avoid those days where I just totally laze out the entire day and not do anything outside of what I needed to do for work. Not that there&#8217;s anything wrong with that &#8211; chilling out is important too &#8211; but I felt like maybe I had a bit too many of those days last year.

Some examples of things which I think will qualify for this resolution:

  1. _Writing a blog post._ (Hooray, I already got one done today!)
  2. _Doing some work on one of my many secret projects that I never get going or never get finished._ There&#8217;s a lot of these to choose from. It helps a bit with my lack of focus &#8211; I can do other projects if I&#8217;m not in the mood for the previous one I was working on. If you&#8217;re curious, this typically means some kind of writing or programming project.
  3. _Some art thing._ I did get back into drawing and sketching in 2016 and kinda tapered off in 2017, hopefully I can get back on track.
  4. _Learning something new_. Arguably reading or being on the internet always lets me learn something new, but let&#8217;s say this means dedicating some focused time to a learning activity.
  5. _Throwing out or deleting stuff I don&#8217;t need anymore._ Not all growth comes from expansion; we also need to throw out old stuff we don&#8217;t need anymore to make room for the new.
  6. _Reorganizing/Cleaning up/Optimizing._ This is pretty broad, but basically anything that streamlines some aspect of my life or makes it easier.

During the previous year, I had actually wanted to pursue many of these things all at once &#8211; I wanted to be able to do daily sketching AND writing AND cleaning up AND side projects, etc. Didn&#8217;t really work out, so this year we lower our standards a bit. Just one of those things per day.

One of the challenges would be finding the time to be personally productive even during those days when I&#8217;m mentally tired out from work stuff &#8211; you know, the kind of day where you get home and you just kinda wanna sit in a chair and not think about stuff too hard. Hopefully I don&#8217;t get too many of those days, but hopefully the resolution inspires me to do even one small thing during the difficult days.
