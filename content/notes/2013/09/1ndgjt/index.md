#### Posted on r/comicbooks: [Cosmic Marvel question (not sure if spoiler)](https://reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/1ndgjt/cosmic_marvel_question_not_sure_if_spoiler/)

Just finished reading Thanos Imperative (great book!). Has it been explained somewhere how Thanos and Peter Quill made it out of the cancerverse?
