I don't remember grinding too much as in fighting just for the sake of gaining levels. Are you doing the quests that will require you to backtrack through older dungeons to farm things (it doesnt feel too much like griding if you're farming for something else). You can go back to earlier dungeons inside the TV by talking to party members, they'll give you a choice to visit the dungeon where they were persona-ized (whatever).

Each of the older dungeons also has an additional optional boss on the top-level, I always did the optional boss of the previous dungeon (I think you get a nice item or something) before going for the boss of the current dungeon.

Try to bring a wide variety of personas in with you all the time, in terms of elemental attacks, so that you can always hit the enemy weak spots. 

I would recommend backtracking for the above stuff particularly before  trying to beat Rise's dungeon where you are now - Rise's dungeon has two bosses at the end.
