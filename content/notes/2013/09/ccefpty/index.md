Whenever a creature with deathtouch deals damage, it's always lethal (to other creatures), whether that damage is via combat, via fighting or via abilities like "T: Deal 1 damage to target creature"

Edit: The relevant rule is the state-based action based on deathtouch, which doesn't discriminate as to the type of damage:

> 704.5h If a creature has toughness greater than 0, and it's been dealt damage by a source with deathtouch since the last time state-based actions were checked, that creature is destroyed. Regeneration can replace this event.
