>it is illegal for them to sell the cross buy digital bonus to someone

I'm not an American, so I'd love a citation on that one.

Regardless, even if they couldn't sell it, it doesn't mean that suddenly it becomes "finders keepers" where the first person who sees it can just get it. 

You know what, I'm not judging or anything, whatever floats your boat. If you think it's okay to get something for free without even asking the owner go ahead. I'm just saying if it were me I'd probably ask the manager or an employee first if I could have the cross buy copy. Maybe even use your arguments that they're not going to use it anyway.
