A bit unrelated and assuming this "free multiplayer weekend" promo is over: I don't have a PS4 yet, but I assume it supports multiple user accounts same as the PS3? My account has PS+, but my brother's does not. If we both have accounts on the same PS4, will my brother be able to play multiplayer from his account?
