You can make an NA account from anywhere, but if you plan to use credit card payments for the store, it will only accept cards with a US address. I'm from SE Asia and I have an NA account, I use prepaid PSN cards for buying stuff.

Edit: and yes, if you have both the NA account and your main account on the same PS3, your main account can play downloads from the NA account.
