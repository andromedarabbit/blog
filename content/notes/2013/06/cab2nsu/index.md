> Because you're making it sound like the current through any particular wire is constant.

Forgive me if I gave that impression, but it's not (as my last post mentioned "if you measured the current in the wire *at that time*). The current passing through a wire or being drawn by a device can change, the same way voltages can change or through switching.
