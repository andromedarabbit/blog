Mick, are you an XBox or Playstation kind of guy?

During your time as a pro wrestler, how did you explain to your kids what you were doing and how you were getting hurt? Did it give you any trouble raising them that they might try some of the dangerous stuff you do?

Who do you think is the best superstar in the WWE right now?
