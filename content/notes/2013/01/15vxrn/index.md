#### Posted on r/ipad: [Can anyone suggest a free offline trivia app?](https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/15vxrn/can_anyone_suggest_a_free_offline_trivia_app/)

I just want an app that gives me trivia questions that I can toss out to people. Nothing that requires an internet connection and preferably no time limits. A wide variety of trivia questions and topics would be great.

Thanks!
