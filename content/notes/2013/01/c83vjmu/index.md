I consider myself ok in terms of strategy like spacing, pokes, mind games and the like, but my problem in general is poor execution; it's most probably because i dont want to put in the effort to memorize and practice combo strings and stuff. Like in sf4 i can pull of fadc's occasionally in training mode, but i dont have any hope of pulling it off in the middle of a heated match. For this reason i tend to rely more on short bnb combos
