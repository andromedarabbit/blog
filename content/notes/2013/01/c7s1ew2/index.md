I'm using BayanDSL. The speed isn't the best, but it's ok most of the time. My brothers are basically playing DOTA2 every night, though they do experience some lag. Customer service is better than PLDT's at least. If I call their trunk line to complain about connection problems they're going to send someone to check the next day. (When they say someone's going to come the next day, it's true)
