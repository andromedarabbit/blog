I'm really only looking forward to this so that the series can finally end. I've been reading this series for almost two decades, stuck through it when it was draggy just for the heck of it. I can barely remember any of the things that happened in the middle books. If I had time I'd reread them all again before the last book comes out but meh, what can you do. There better be a damn good ending!
