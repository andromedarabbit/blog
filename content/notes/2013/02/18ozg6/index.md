#### Posted on r/SomebodyMakeThis: [[SMT] a location-based reminder app](https://reddit.com/r/SomebodyMakeThis/comments/18ozg6/smt_a_locationbased_reminder_app/)

Not sure how exactly it would work or how precise the location-based APIs are, but basically I would like an app that can let make reminders to myself like:

- when I get home, remind me to do X

- next time I'm at this restaurant, remind me to order Y

etc
