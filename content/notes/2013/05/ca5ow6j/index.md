The characters are all owned by Marvel. Marvel is owned by Disney.

Sony doesnt "own" the Spider-man franchise. Sony has an exclusive license from Marvel to use Spider-man in movies; that means only they can produce Spider-man movies. The license is from before Marvel had their own movie studio. 

Fox also has a similar license for the X-Men/Fantastic Four.

For any characters where Marvel hasn't given anyone else an exclusive movie license, they can use those characters in their own movies.
