> Turn-based RPGs, for example, really have nothing to show in terms of gameplay. I suppose responsive menus and quick responses to button presses, but past that it gets pretty hard to improve the gameplay aspect of it.

Wat. I take it these type of games aren't really your style. Skill trees and builds, ability choices, enemy balancing, equipment choices are all gameplay elements.
