I understand where you're coming from, but to claim that Marvel doesn't make new heroes is maybe just a little bit disingenuous.

Characters on these covers that were introduced since the year 2000:

- America Chavez (2011)

- Silk (2014)

- Spider-Gwen (2014)

- Fantomex (2002)

- Hulkling (2005)

- Wiccan (2005)

- Agent Coulson (2008)

- Nico Minoru (2003)

- Kamala Khan (Ms Marvel) (2013)

- Half the people on the Web Warriors cover

I'm not counting Miles since you don't seem to like that he's also "Spider-Man" even though that shouldn't really matter. There's also two people I don't recognize on the Uncanny Inhumans cover, IDK if they're new.
