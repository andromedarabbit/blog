They don't feel out of vogue. Off the top of my head, turn-based games I played within the last year: Persona Q, Disgaea 4, Divinity:OS. Bravely Default, Fire Emblem: Awakening, X-Com, Civ 5 (okay, I play Civ every year). I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting.

Edit: I also played Banner Saga and Shadowrun Returns Dragonfall, thanks to the replies for reminding me
