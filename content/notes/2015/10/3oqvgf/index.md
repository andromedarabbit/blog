#### Posted on r/civ: [Quick achievements question: For achievements that count things across multiple playthroughs, does it count when I use a different computer?](https://reddit.com/r/civ/comments/3oqvgf/quick_achievements_question_for_achievements_that/)

I've been travelling for a few months and have been playing Civ V on my laptop where I already sunk 300+hours into my desktop back home. Will any mines I built/forests I chopped/etc count towards my totals back home?

Thanks!
