#### Posted on r/london: [Planning to visit the Natural History Museum this afternoon](https://reddit.com/r/london/comments/3ixso7/planning_to_visit_the_natural_history_museum_this/)

Just something I decided this morning when I woke up lol. Should I expect a lot of people? Long queues? Is it better to book tickets online or I can I just go?
