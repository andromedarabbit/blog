When I was growing up, I was acutely aware of how much my parents worked hard and sacrificed to not only get me and my brothers through school but also buy us nice toys and other things on occasion. They would spend overtime at work, commute every day for hours at a time, sometimes even pull some extra work on the side when the family needed extra money. I promised myself that when I graduated I would try to ease their burden as much as possible, and I put in my share - paying some of the bills and putting my youngest brother through college, especially once my mother retired (my father is still working). And my parents are certainly very grateful for any help that I do provide, and never ask anything of me unless there is no alternative (usually ako na ang nagvovolunteer)

\nEveryone has a different situation; maybe you are not as grateful to your parents for some reason; maybe they can easily support themselves and your siblings without your help; maybe you have nothing to spare even for yourself. You are certainly not obliged to take on their burdens (especially if they are more than capable of doing so), but there is no harm in showing gratitude for the life they have given you, if you can spare it.
