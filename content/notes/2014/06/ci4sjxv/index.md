I dunno about you guys, but I reckon I'll still be using my Vita at least a year or two from now.

I still have a decent Vita backlog...and I'm still looking forward to Tales of Hearts R and probably Freedom Wars. 

That's not even counting the additional playtime it's going to get when I get a PS4

Edit: And also Gravity Rush 2! And Disgaea 4 (best on handheld~)!
