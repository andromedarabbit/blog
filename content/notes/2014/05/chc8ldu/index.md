Thank you for taking the time to reply Alison. Wizards has always been very good in engaging the community, so hopefully at some point there can be a more open dialogue to discuss the feedback with the community and the perceived problems with the new client.

I personally do not mind using the new client, but some of the reports here like slower machines being unable to run it at all are worrying; if enough of the population have a problem with the new client, it may negatively affect the user base.
