The next standard daily was like six hours away so I just played a few games in the tournament practice room instead. I used the same decklist with minor changes (Guildgates -> Temples and Thoughtseizes instead of Duress in the SB; SB Celestial Flare -> SB Hero's Downfall because I didnt have the flares oddly enough)

I only played single games since I wanted to get a hang of the deck. I lost the first two due to poor handling (played a High Priest into an empty board, wasting it, and thinking the newt did -4/-4 when I only had the cauldron and not the witch), but won the next 3.

Some comments:

- Grim return seems poor/situational, I never got to use it once. Though, it can hit opponent GYs right? I guess an upside would be he could animate the discard off that rat guy.

- You have trouble/a slow start if you don't have an early newt; your only way to tutor him comes out turn 4 at the earliest

- seem to have trouble/no way to recover if the opp gets into an early creature advantage. My two losses had 4+ creatures on the other side
