Aside from looking for a cheap competitive deck (probably red), look for a team. Having a team of players lowers the costs considerably since it gives the team access to a pool of cards, more than just one person can have. Not all team members may be available for all events, so you may be able to just borrow decks from time to time. Even if you don't contribute much financially to the team, you can still be a solid contributor by providing good playtesting and support.
