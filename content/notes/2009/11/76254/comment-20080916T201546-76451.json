The process of `INSERT`ing and selecting the resultant auto-generated keys must be atomic, otherwise you may receive inconsistent results on the key select.  Consider two asynchronous `INSERT`s where they both complete before either has a chance to select the generated keys.  Which process gets which list of keys?  Most cross-database ORMs have to do annoying things like in-process thread locking in order to keep results deterministic.  This is *not* something you want to do by hand, especially if you are using a database which does support atomic generated key retrieval (HSQLDB is the only one I know of which does not).", "date": "2008-09-16 20:15:46", "photo": "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/6883cab0dedd4d45544abfc7eb788e82?s=128&d=identicon&r=PG", "source_url": "https://superuser.com/questions/76254/wd-external-hd-no-longer-working", "mention_url": "https://superuser.com/questions/76254/wd-external-hd-no-longer-working", "source": "stackexchange"}
