I can only sympathize with the Sony developers who are probably putting in massive overtime because of all the public pressure (including from places like reddit) that makes their manages push hard on them. They're probably being given impossible deadlines/targets too, and when they inevitably slip, Sony has to give an update like this. Estimation isn't easy people, especially under pressure!
