The medium(Normal) computer isn't very good as a gauge of your abilities as it isn't very difficult at all.

I'm not a particularly good MvC3 player, but here's some ideas: Are you able to block correctly? Do you use assists to create openings? If you have trouble doing hypers on the fly, have you tried doing them in training? Completing a few missions? 

Actually I think Wolverine can do Berserker Barrage X (QCF + AA) off most light or medium attacks, so you should be able to practice like Light into Medium into down-forward + Light + Medium at least. I find this easier on an arcade stick instead of a controller though due to the button layout.
