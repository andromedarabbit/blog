What is your purpose in presenting the website idea? Are you hiring the programmer to:

- Design the website? (Not just graphic design, but to flesh out the details of how your requirements can be met, like what screens will be needed, what sort of data will be stored)\n- Implement a design you already have? (In which case the design better be thorough! You wouldn't come up to a carpenter and just say "Build me a shelf!" without any details)\n
