#### Posted on r/ipad: [Can someone recommend a comic book reader (CBR/CBZ) with the following features:](https://reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/mv9ji/can_someone_recommend_a_comic_book_reader_cbrcbz/)

- preferably free :)
- easy to transfer/manage lots of files including folder hierarchy (talking hundreds of files in dozens of folders here)

I'm currently using ComicFlow, but the limitation of this app is that it only supports a folder structure that is up to one folder deep.

Please don't recommend Stanza, the file management there is terrible when you get to a larger number of files.

Thanks :D
