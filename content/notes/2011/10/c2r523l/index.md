I had the multitouch gestures before the update (i have developer mode) so it is quite ridiculous how ios5 disabled it for ipad1s since ive never had a problem with the feature. Either apple hates us ipad1 owners or they want to force us to upgrade. Having multitouch gestures really made the ipad a lot more usable, i will miss it greatly (and no i dont want to jailbreak~)
