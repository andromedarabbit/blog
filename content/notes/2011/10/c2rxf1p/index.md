Stay out of the scary places for now. Try fighting aboveground things first... fiends or or radscorpions and such, so you get used to paying attention to looking at your radar (lower left corner) to be aware of nearby enemies. Also you might want to increase your perception stat so that enemies show on the radar earlier.
