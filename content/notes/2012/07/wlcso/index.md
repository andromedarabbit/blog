#### Posted on r/AskReddit: [How likely is it that some shadowy illuminati-type organization exists secretly controlling and manipulating the world?](https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/wlcso/how_likely_is_it_that_some_shadowy_illuminatitype/)

Or, how difficult would it be for we as redditors to start one (obviously we're not going to post about it here!)

It seems the secretiveness of the affair would make it difficult to scale worldwide.
