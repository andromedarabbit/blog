#### Posted on r/magicTCG: [Can anyone recommend a bot that sells (or gives away maybe) commons/uncommons on MTGO?](https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/plq5d/can_anyone_recommend_a_bot_that_sells_or_gives/)

I just wanna build a few casual decks, don't wanna spend too much. But I need some commons/uncs that may be used in some standard decks (like Vapor Snag, Delver, etc). Any suggestions?
