As much as I support this post, I'm afraid it's not really going to do much to change the minds of those who feel really entitled to it. They are too blinded by nerdrage to understand what this chart means, I say just let them rant it all out and ignore the multiple threads about it, until ME3's release date when the rage subsides as they enjoy the game.
