Sorry, I don't know what to tell you but that's how this game is played on the competitive level. When the world/internet has already built the top tier of decks, the option exists to simply tweak one of those decks for your meta and rely on your play skill to see you through. You can go against the tide and build your own deck, but you better be damn well prepared for the top tier decks regardless. Budget isn't really an excuse.

There's always casual play with friends where you can agree not to play netdecks.
