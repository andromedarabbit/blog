Black Mirror S4 reviews (episodes listed from most enjoyed to least):
4.6. Black Museum (reminds me of White Christmas)
4.1. USS Callister (fun, but I was annoyed by how infeasible the technical premise was)
4.4. Hang the DJ (kind of telegraphed the ending)
4.3. Crocodile (felt like a police procedural)
4.5. Metalhead (would have probably appreciated it more if it wasn't a Black Mirror episode)
4.2. Arkangel (kinda boring and draggy)
Overall I liked S3 a lot more
