A couple of questions about the legacy finals (sorry, I only caught a portion of it and not really a legacy player): there's a monarch effect in play, where did that come from? I skimmed the decklists and couldnt find it. Also speaking of decklists, there's a Throne of Geth in Josh Utter-Leyton's SB, what's that for?

Edit: Oops, sorry. Checked the decklists again, saw that Palace Jailer gives monarch. Only thing I'm confused about now is Throne of Geth!
