I did a prerelease at the Hareruya in Tokyo (because it happened to coincide with a trip with friends), it was cool. I think they're pretty used to foreigners coming in, they had English-language prerelease packs for us. And everyone could communicate to some degree. I was mostly able to cope despite not being 100% familiar with the cards. My one problem was when someone played a creature with an ability that I wasn't sure what it was and the guy had to say it a few times. I kept hearing "mens" but eventually figured out it was "menace" lol.

(This anecdote isn't really relevant to constructed I guess lol sorry)
