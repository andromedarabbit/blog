Note sure if this is a good place to ask but: I'm thinking of getting a MacBook Pro, should I worry about the supposed keyboard issues?  Background: my main reason for wanting to replace my windows laptop with  an apple one is so i can compile my react native projects for ios  release. (Previously I had been asking my brother to do it for me). I’ve  avoided getting one mostly due to how expensive it is compared to a  windows machine, but I might be willing to bite the bullet now. Since  I’m a programmer, the reported issues with the new keyboard concern me,  how likely am I to encounter this problem, assuming I am buying brand  new?
