It's pattern recognition. You have to be able to deduce a pattern from the earlier entries.

In your example, you can see that in the first 3, there are 1, 2, and 3 lines near the edge in the first 3 boxes, so logically there must be 4 lines in the next box. This eliminates the 2nd and 4th answers. 

In the first 3 boxes, the symbols are on the bottom, then the left edge, then the bottom again. If you choose the first answer for the fourth box, that makes [bottom, left, bottom, bottom] which is no pattern, while if you choose the third answer, the pattern is [bottom, left, bottom, left], so the answer is C
