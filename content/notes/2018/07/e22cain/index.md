I have yet to see a compelling and detailed economic analysis as to how it will benefit each region (as in, I'd like to see a breakdown of the expected economic benefit to each region)

As for cons:

- between fascist tendencies, highly divisive political tactis, and at best a loose relationship with the truth, such a large change cannot be entrusted to this administration
- federalism creates a 2-tier taxation system (state and federal), possibly leading to more taxes
- empowers political dynasties
- costly transition without clear cost/benefit analysis
- our societal problems are largely cultural in nature, changing the system of government will do little to address that

That being said, I could see why some people might like it, and I am not against changing the charter per se (I agree that there are some problematic things with the 1987 constitution)
