As promised, I checked out Disney Life via Globe's promo. The movie selection is quite limited (&lt;10 mcu movies, 5 star wars movies, etc). On the other hand, they already have 12 episodes of the new DuckTales (Woo-oo!) and Star Wars Rebels

annoyingly however, I can't seem to watch stuff on Disney Life via my desktop web browser. I had to download an iPad app
