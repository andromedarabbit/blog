Whenever there's a mass shooting in the US, there's a call for more gun control, and then gun fanatics buy up high-powered arms in anticipation of more controls, which increases the likelihood of more mass shootings. It's a positive feedback loop!

I'm curious as to whether the actual statistics bear this theory  out. I'm also curious as to where the US' breaking point will be before  they decide they've had enough of this loop.
