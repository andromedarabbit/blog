It's interesting to read about the details of Mueller's Russian indictments. It gives a pretty good picture of how Russia was able to weaponize the internet and social media by preying on things like human ignorance and filter bubbles to effectively divide a nation.

This is the modern face of information warfare, and Russia is  leading the way. I'm curious as to if and how society will adjust and push back against these trends

(It's actually surprising that in the latest [@CivGame](https://twitter.com/CivGame/) expansion they don't have a Spy mission to reduce loyalty in an enemy  city).
