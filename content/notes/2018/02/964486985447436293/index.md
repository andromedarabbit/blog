BLACK PANTHER spoiler-free review!

- it's a fun, action-filled romp and Wakanda is amazing
- tchalla was ok, killmonger and nakia were great, shuri was badass
- some of the actions scenes didnt seem too well-shot/edited, making them hard to follow (1/7)

- I realize I'm saying this about a universe where there are talking raccoons and magic hammers, but some of the Wakandan tech push the boundaries of my suspension of disbelief (2/7)

- my expectations  were probably set a bit too high what with some people saying it's the  best MCU movie since Iron Man or calling it revolutionary or eye-opening
- off the top of my head I consider Civil War, Spider-Man Homecoming and Thor Ragnarok better than this one (3/7)

-   I understand that it's revolutionary in the sense that it's a  major   hollowood motion picture filled with a cast of mostly african  descent   and that some of the characters are motivated by real world racial issues. (4/7)
