#### Posted on r/magicTCG: [I feel like tournament mulligan rules should be modified to give each player one free mulligan per game before they have to go down to 6 cards](https://reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/a2ljdx/i_feel_like_tournament_mulligan_rules_should_be/)

I mean, I understand why mana screw exists, but 1 free mulligan per game would greatly help reduce "feel bad" games
