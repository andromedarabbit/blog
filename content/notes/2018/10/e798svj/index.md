There's this video my brother shared to our family chat group, where my one and a half year old nephew is sitting on a chair and animatedly telling a story, complete with facial expressions and hand motions and pointing around and everything, except everything he says is gibberish because he doesn't really know how to talk yet. I've watched it for the fourth time just now and it still makes me giggle.
