Back when Future Sight had just come out, I went into a store to check their singles and they had like 8 copies of this weird green rare they were selling for less than $1 a pop. I looked at it for a bit, and I thought it might be fun to try to build a deck around. But for whatever reason I wasn't in the mood to buy cards that day so I figured I'd come back to it the next time I was in the store. The very next weekend, there was a GP, and the price of Tarmogoyf immediately spiked to around 20-30 dollars and never went back down. Today they're at $100+ a pop, I still only have the one copy I got from a booster pack.
