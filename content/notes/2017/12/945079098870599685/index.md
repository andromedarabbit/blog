Think about the amount of software and AI that goes into a droid in the Star Wars universe. A droid like BB-8 has to be able to:

- navigate (walk/roll) over any terrain 
- interface with any other system
- repair spacecraft like X-Wings
- have natural language processing that can understand up to billions of galactic dialects
- make judgments as to whether people are trustworthy

- be able to communicate and express emotion using a series of tones and beeps
(surprisingly   for all of BB8 and R2D2's sophistication, no one considered adding a   voice synthesizer to these models - C3P0 shows their software is   certainly capable of speaking)

At this point, they're   more like Transformers who can't speak very  well (similar to  Bumblebee),  actual living machines (which raises the  question of  whether it's  ethical to be trading or selling them the  way the jawas  do).

We should  get a Star Wars movie where it's  explained how droids  are actually  created by the All-Spark (directed by Michael Bay? lol)

Also, yes I did rewatch The Force Awakens yesterday
