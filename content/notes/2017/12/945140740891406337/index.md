It's nice that the missing girl was found before Christmas, but this might make people think that social media is a good approach for missing persons cases, but I don't think it's the sort of thing that can scale to handle more missing persons cases

Not every case is going to go viral, since people only have so much attention to give to such cases before they get tired of their feeds being nothing but missing person reports.

I don't have an alternative. Obviously if a loved one is missing, you'll try everything you can.

I think in this particular case, they got lucky that she was found, and they had contacts who were able to help the call go viral.
