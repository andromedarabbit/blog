Nah, I like living here, in spite of everything, and I'm programming avails me a good living naman. I've worked abroad on short stints (pinadala ng company), but TBH, I had never even considered leaving the country long-term, but I started looking into it after 2016. Hassle for me na ma-uproot and to try to start over elsewhere.
