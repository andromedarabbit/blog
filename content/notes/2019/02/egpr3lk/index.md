Shifting careers from IT support isn't an unreasonable proposition, but you need to already know your stuff before going in for interviews. You will also still need some basic level of programming knowledge. A lot of things you'll need can be learned on the fly/on the job (like usage of specific languages or tools or libraries), but you need a good basic foundation to build on. 

If I'm interviewing someone coming from a nonprogrammming background, I'll basically be treating her as an entry-level candidate. You will need to be able to justify why I should hire you over say, a fresh grad who still remembers his java programming from his college days. The interviewer will need to know you're not trying to BS your way into the position. Having some work you can show off (side projects or whatever) can be a big help. You can also cite anything you're doing in your current domain that might show off some related skillset. Like, if you did some minor scripting to gather support statistics, something like that? IDK if IT support people do that kind of stuff. See my other interview tips in the other answer elsewhere in this thread too.
