Captain Marvel spoiler-free review!  - movie was pretty good, no major issues - doesnt follow the typical MCU origin story 'formula' - some weird pacing issues in a few places, but that just might be because of the chosen story direction - lots of little call-outs and tie-ins to the other MCU movies (although I feel like they could have done a bit more in some spots) - I am not a cat person. But if you are a cat person, you might like this: there is a cat. - There's some parts that made it obvious they were aiming for that Wonder Woman audience, so the movie may be better for you if you're in that demo (but I think WW was a better movie overall) - Imax was pretty good, nothing too excessive - Midcredits scene, and postcredits scene - Magugustuhan ba ni mama? Possibly! Also, its a good idea to bring little girls to watch this movie
