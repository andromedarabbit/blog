I made a 3AM decision to switch over the site's front page to show what was previously under "Stream" and now the "Posts" section is listed in the menu as "Blog". We'll see if I like this better. Also, the [root RSS feed](/index.xml) now includes everything from "Stream" as well. IDK how many people were following this site via an RSS reader (I would like it if you guys told me!), but for those of you who do: surprise, you are in for a firehose! If you only want the longer-form traditional blog posts, an [RSS feed for that is still available](/post/index.xml).

I also moved the fanfics from before into a [new "Fiction" section](/fiction). I had previously tried moving them under posts but it felt weird that the archive said I had posts from before 2002 since technically the blog hadn't existed yet. So that this section isn't made up entirely of old fanfiction, I also put up a short story I had written a couple of years ago. I probably have some more fiction hidden somewhere. If not, I'll make some!

Smaller site updates like this will probably just be under "Notes" in the future, instead of full-length blog posts. All changes can still be followed using the changelog tag.
