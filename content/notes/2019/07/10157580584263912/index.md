Spider-Man: Far From Home spoiler-free review!  - I watched Far From Home while I was... far from home. - great movie, lots of fun, and the stakes are a lot higher than the Vulture just stealing some tech off Tony Stark - basically a story of Peter Parker the high school student trying to juggle his Spider-Man problems with his high school life, which was one of the best eras of comic book Spider-Man - the movie gives us a look at what the world looks like post-Endgame and how weird it is for everyone - if you've seen the trailers, you know who the "villain" is and you have certain expectations coming in. I was worried this would be a problem but it worked out fine, it wasn't a problem and was handled well - There is a mid-credits scene, possibly one of the best I've ever seen, in terms of how it changes the entire tone of the movie. There is also a post-credits scene, the implications of which are still unclear and will leave the fanbase speculating for a while - Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Possibly! There's a lot of "cute" Peter Parker high school moments she'd probably like, and the plot and action aren't too hard to follow
