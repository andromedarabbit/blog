A penny is roughly the value of the PH's 5 peso coin, and we still have at least four denominations beneath that! Our money is barely worth printing? https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/1085427364924776450
Oops, I missed a decimal place, awkward lol. A penny is roughly 50c. So only 2 or 3 denominations below that!
