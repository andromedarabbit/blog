There should be an emote for "Hey man, just let me have this win, I've been grinding for hours and only need one more to rank up"

Doesnt even matter what game I'm talking about!

And of course, there should also be the appropriate emote response "Sorry man, I still need to get my daily win"
And also "BRB man gotta pee"
