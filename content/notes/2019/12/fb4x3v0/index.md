Be random.

In an episode of Futurama, Fry gained the ability to read minds and tried to use it to win a big Poker tournament. In the final table, he was up against Bender, and they were the last two players. For the final hand, Bender didn't even bother looking at his cards and went all-in, giving Fry's mind-reading no chance to work.

In One Piece, the protagonist Luffy was having trouble fighting bad guy Enel who could read his opponent's intentions. What Luffy did was to bounce his barrage of attacks against a wall, so that neither he nor Enel could predict which way they would go, so that Enel would be unable to avoid them.
