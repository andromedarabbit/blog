Sorry, after I posted the comment above, I didn't have much time to grind Arena that month so I don't have much more input. The deck is sweet but it fares much better against aggro decks than the various ramp and control decks that become more prevalent once you're in Diamond or higher.

For this month, I've switched to Gruul aggro for Historic BO3, the games tend to go a lot faster :)
