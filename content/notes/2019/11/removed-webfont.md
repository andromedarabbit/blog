FontAwesome has been fun and all, but in the interest of reducing load time and external dependencies, I removed the FA dependency on this blog and switched to SVG icons instead. Icons are from [here](http://svgicons.sparkk.fr/), specifically the [set by Bryn Taylor](https://dribbble.com/shots/1934932-77-Essential-Icons-Free-Download) and the Special Social Icon Set #9. Not all the icons carried over, especially some of the social ones (Mastodon, etc). Workarounds had to be made. Hopefully nothing breaks!
