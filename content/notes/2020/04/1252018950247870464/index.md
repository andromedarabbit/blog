So, how does this work: World hit 1M confirmed cases around Apr 3 (17 days ago). Should we expect at least 1M outcomes by now? Worldwide stats currently only have &lt; 900k deaths+recoveries. Is it just due to confirmatory testing delays? (The discrepancy is much worse in the PH)

well, a doctor friend tells me that severe to critical cases may take much longer to recover, so I guess that's the source of the discrepancy? is it like 10% severe to critical cases?
