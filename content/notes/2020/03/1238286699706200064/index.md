FIVE. PER. TRAIN. !!! 

{{% quoted url="https://twitter.com/otherswimmerpls/status/1238266189127667713" label="otherswimmerpls's tweet" %}}

This morning, I decided I'd ride MRT3/[@dotrmrt3](https://twitter.com/dotrmrt3/) going to work, a long queue welcomed me, they were implementing the "only 5" passengers allowed per train policy for social distancing purposes, after staying in the line for 45 minutes, I decided to transfer to LRT1.

I decided to check for "mrt social distancing" on twitter and found conflicting reports. Some say its 10 per train, some say its 5-6 per train door, etc. Most likely walang consistent policy. The only sure thing is mahaba ang pila sa labas ng mga station
