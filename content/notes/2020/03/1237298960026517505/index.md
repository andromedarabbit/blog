[@mariachong](https://twitter.com/mariachong/) This reminds me of a parable about a man who turns away rescuers several times because he says god will save him and when he dies he asks god why he didnt save him and god is like "what are you talking about I sent so many rescuers to you". Well not that exact wording/story lol

[@mariachong](https://twitter.com/mariachong/) I mean, if you have so much faith in God why not believe that he can save us through science and other people
