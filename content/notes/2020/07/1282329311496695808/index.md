The screencapped tweet and the preceding discussions reveal a particularly insidious mindset among the fanatics: (a) they understand full well what this admin is doing despite the palace's BS claims of "neutrality" (1/x)

Nope. Never have and never will. I made my "fuck you" money investing in the Filipino people. It's called "fuck you" money because I have enough saved up to say that if pressured.



And nope never tagging you or your wife. #StarveTheTrolls

(b) they see no need to hold the powerful to account for abusing their position in service of vindictiveness and personal agenda; and even worse  (2/x)

(c) they expect that everyone else should have to bend the knee, and stoop down to their level of transactional politics in order to do business in this country.  (3/x)

For them, the ABS shutdown is less a delivery of justice and more of a takedown of an "enemy" who refused to play the games they think should be played

this is a dangerous pragmatism about the way the world works, the belief that we shouldn't question how things are and just "play ball", so to speak, instead of working to make things better.

The world isn't perfect, but for that reason we have to believe it can still be improved, and to speak truth to power where we can, so that we are not stuck in the "reality" these people seem to be content to muck around in.
