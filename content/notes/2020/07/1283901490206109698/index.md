Thread of #mtg JumpStart results: Attempt 1: Milling Elves, 2-0.

Attempt 2: Heavily Armored Enchanted (terrible choices - no way to get things off the board, Thriving lands are bad when monocolored, annoyed whenever I draw Gird for Battle), 2-4

Attempt 3: Feathered Friends + Basri. These white decks aren't good for my daily quests. Even less removal. 2-5. I think that's enough for today.

Attempt 4: Plus One Dragons. 2-0. The sad thing about this format is that you tend to spend more time with the suckier decks and not enough time with the fun ones. (I know, I know, that's actually up to me, but I want to sample as many pairs as possible!)

Attempt 5: Archeology Under The Sea. Why did I go monocolor again? 2-6. Deck was fun, but way too slow (check out that "curve"). Aaaaand I'm out of gold, so that's enough JumpStart for a while.

Attempt 6: Dinosaurs Reanimated. 2-1. Power level reasonably high, with removal coming mostly from the green side (surprisingly!).
