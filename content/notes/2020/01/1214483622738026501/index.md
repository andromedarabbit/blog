Trying to justify poor performance with approval ratings is a tacit admission that your goal was window-dressing all along and not actually doing your job. Let the people approve because you did the thing, not because you tricked them into thinking you did.

> The police and the government should stop using approval ratings to justify their failures.

> Beyond legitimate questions about the valditity of some opinion surveys, popularity is a poor substitute for truth or justice.
