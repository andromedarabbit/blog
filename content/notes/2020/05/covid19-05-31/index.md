Covid19 thoughts and updates:

- Metro Manila is lower restrictions again and going into ECQ tomorrow, June the 1st. Only a two week MECQ transition period, and not really any time to evaluate what the effect that has had on the case numbers. This is reopening for the sake of the economy, without regard for the medical data. I'm still not going out. Public transportation will still be limited, so I kind of expect chaos Monday morning.
- Speaking of medical data, the DOH has changed the way they report new cases, now dividing them into "fresh" and "tardy" cases. The tardy ones are the ones that were delayed by 4 or more days due to validation or some other reason. This seems like propaganda to make things seem not so bad, especially since there have been an explosion of cases in the past few days, probably as a result of lowering restrictions.
- Watched mass via Facebook again today.
- Went out for groceries this past Saturday. Had to do it on a weekend, since my dad drives the car to work on weekdays now and we need that for groceries. Surprisingly, a bunch of things that were always out of stock the past couple of months were available this time around.
- Lazada is back to shipping non-essentials again, and I've already [ordered a thing](/2020/05/hyperx-cloud2/).
- As of last night, we are at 13777 cases (+180 from the day before, +1264 from last week), 863 deaths (+6 from the day before, +39 from last week), 3177 recoveries (+85 from the day before, +542 last week). "Last week" numbers slightly lower because it's only been 6 days since the last report. Maybe I should be monitoring the active cases too? Apparently our active case count has never dropped, and the DOH backlog in confirming cases is only getting larger. [Reference.](https://covid19ph.com/)
- As of last night, we are at 18086 cases (+862 from the day before, +4309 from last week), 957 deaths (+7 from the day before, +94 from last week), 3909 recoveries (+101 from the day before, +732 last week). The case numbers are exploding in growth, presumably because the DOH is catching up to the backlog, but that's still super unsettling. [Reference.](https://covid19ph.com/)
- Worldwide, we are at 6.2 million cases and 372,000 deaths. Caveat: these numbers are from [Worldometer](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html).
