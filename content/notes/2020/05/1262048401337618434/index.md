Since we are already relaxing qurantine a bit, I have decided to commemorate the occasion by finally replacinf the wall clock batteries. Maybe that will help time make sense again

The analog wall clock in my room randomly stops and I guess it starts again

at some point since the time changes, so whenever I look at it I basically

get a random time. I thought about changing the batteries, but then I

realized this is super on brand for the quarantine period.
