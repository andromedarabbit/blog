I would just word it with a keyword, the same way other games like Hearthstone or Eternal do. Something like "Arrives - Draw a card". Same thing for death triggers. "Dies - Deal 2 damage to any target". "Arrives" isn't too great, but in my head it evokes the "oh, it happens when he's already here" feeling. 

That Saga wording is actually reminder text, the actual Saga rules text should be the same as normal ETB triggers and draw step triggers.
