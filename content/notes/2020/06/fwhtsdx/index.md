In the Philippines, a lot of people like having the so-called "silog" meals - "silog" stands for "sinangag" (garlic fried rice) + "itlog" (egg). Basically rice meals usually with a meat viand. Examples are:

"tapsilog" - "tapa" (dried or cured thinly-sliced beef or similar meat) + silog

"tocilog" - "tocino" (sweetened and cured pork belly) + silog

"longsilog" - "longganiza" (sausages flavoured with indigenous spices) + silog

"hotsilog" - hotdogs + silog

etc

There's also a bread roll called "pandesal" (literally salted bread from Spanish), commonly consumed for breakfast, usually with some spread or some meat filling, sometimes you dip it in coffee.
