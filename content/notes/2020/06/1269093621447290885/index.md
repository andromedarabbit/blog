[@AskPlayStation](https://twitter.com/AskPlayStation/) there's some problem with the email verification links you're sending out, there's an error with the ssl certificate on the site it links to. Some details here: https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/gx4pjp/anyone_else_not_able_to_verify_email/ (this isnt me, but it's the same issue)

is this a known issue? How to resolve?

in case someone needs a solution for this, I added a comment to the reddit thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/playstation/comments/gx4pjp/anyone_else_not_able_to_verify_email/ft30jyz/
