Hey, in case you still need this: I was able to resolve the issue by going to [store.playstation.com](https://store.playstation.com) on my web browser, trying to log in, then telling it to resend the verification code. The new verification email had a link that goes to a [sony.com](https://sony.com) subdomain instead of a [playstation.com](https://playstation.com) subdomain, and that one didn't have the SSL certificate problem.
