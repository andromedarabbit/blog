Covid19 thoughts and updates, June 28 edition:

- Wew, it's almost July! It's unlikely that the Metro Manila GCQ gets further loosened though. 
- A lot of new cases recently have been reported in Cebu/Region VII. Some dumbass things coming out of their local officials too. 
- Haven't had a haircut for 6 months now. People keep asking me when I'm getting one, but it doesn't really seem essential?
- Did a grocery run Saturday afternoon. Surprisingly, fewer people than I expected. Still unable to find Choc-Nut in the grocery.
- We had internet service people coming in this week, and a friend working in UK said to give them masks to wear and I was like "That's ridiculous, of course they'll bring their own." Apparently the expectation is a lot different in the UK, unsurprisingly.
- (That doesn't mean I wasn't worried about having the masked strangers from the outside in our home...)
- Despite all of these precautions, I can't help but feel quite a bit of anxiety visiting these medical facilities. 
- Watched mass via Facebook again today, after our internet came back.
- As of last night, we are at 34803 cases (+738 from the day before, +5403 from last week), 1236 deaths (+12 from the day before, +86 from last week), 9430 recoveries (+249 from the day before, +1780 from last week). New cases still accelerating week-on-week. I read somewhere that they're planning to tweak how they report recoveries, presumably to make it look like we have less active cases?

- Worldwide, we are at 10,087,840 cases and around 501k deaths. Ten million! Once again roughly a million new cases during the week. USA still number one, but Brazil racing to catch up. Caveat: these numbers are from [Worldometer](https://edition.cnn.com/interactive/2020/05/world/worldometer-coronavirus-mystery/index.html).
