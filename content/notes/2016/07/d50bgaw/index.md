My vote goes to Stay Out of My Path by /u/MindInTheClouds, it was the one I most enjoyed reading.

As an aside, I want to say I'm very happy I made it to this round of the contest. It's a pleasant surprise since I basically decided to join at the last minute and rushed out an entry on the day of the deadline. This is officially my excuse for any poor editing on my part :D

I'm fairly new to this sub, so IDK how often contests like these are held, but I look forward to participating in the next one (and I'll try to start earlier next time!). I've already learned a lot, and I'd like to say thanks to everyone who read my entry and who voted for me and gave me feedback, it's been great :D
