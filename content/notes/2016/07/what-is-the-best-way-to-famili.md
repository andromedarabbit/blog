<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The best way is to take a programming class in school. I think many schools will offer that option now.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If that option is not available to you, there are a lot of free materials online for self-learning. You could start with languages that donâ€™t need much setup, such as Javascript or Python.</p></span>
