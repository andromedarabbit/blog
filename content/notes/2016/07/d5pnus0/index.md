Spanish is actually the easiest Duolingo language to pick up for Filipinos, because a lot of the words are similar to either Filipino usage or English usage. 

The main issues are (1) word gender (a concept that exists in neither English nor Filipino), (2) subject-verb agreement (unlike English where the choice is simply between singular and plural, Spanish adds the complication of different verb forms depending on first, second or third person, with variations depending on gender and singular/plural), and (3) object pronouns, that shit is hard. These are the main issues you have to focus on in order to have relatively decent grammar.

I'm at 50% Spanish fluency, I started like early 2015. I think I actually got to 60+% fluency but I stopped for a few months so it dropped. When I started I would keep each category at full strength - whenever one of them dropped I would go back and strengthen it again, but that led to slow progress. This time I'm going through all the categories first (I'm down to the last 10 or so categories), then will go back and reinforce them later. Not sure if this will be more effective, but I figure I would go wide first then strengthen those places where I turn out to be weak

As with all sorts of learning, the key is really to practice, practice, practice. Devote time and energy to it. It would help if you had a Spanish-speaking friend you could talk to regularly
