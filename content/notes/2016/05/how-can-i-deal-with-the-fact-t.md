Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [How can I deal with the fact that I work with really smart, intelligent people and I am not very smart?](https://www.quora.com/How-can-I-deal-with-the-fact-that-I-work-with-really-smart-intelligent-people-and-I-am-not-very-smart/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you feel that you are working on a team where everyone else in the room is smarter than you, then you are very lucky! You have a unique opportunity: you can learn from everyone else!</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There is a saying "If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room." This is because if you are the smartest person in the room, not only will you be doing all the work, but you will not be growing as much as you could if you were working with people who are smarter than you.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">So take advantage of this opportunity to learn from your coworkers and better yourself.</p></span>
