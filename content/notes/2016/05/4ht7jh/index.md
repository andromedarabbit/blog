I'm not going to try to change your minds, but which of the following views do you hold (EJK = extra judicial killings):

1. I think there are no EJKs in Davao

2. I think there are EJKs in Davao, but the authorities/the mayor are not involved

3. I think that those allegedly killed by EJKs were killed by authorities in legitimate operations or self-defense

4. I think there are EJKs in Davao, and the authorities are involved, but it's okay because:
a. They're criminals and they deserve it
b. Going through the judicial system takes too long
c. Hindi naman ako affected
d. It is an acceptable price to pay for peace and order/progress

5. Edit: I don't want to think about it kasi wala naman akong first-hand info

6. Something else (feel free to explain)
