My 3 articles were https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2-hydroxymuconate-semialdehyde_hydrolase, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Hance_Trail and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Taylor_(1957_pitcher)

I managed to find an image reference for Harry Taylor from this site: http://www.kansascitybaseballhistoricalsociety.com/we%20remember.html

Here's the sketch: https://65.media.tumblr.com/4dc3aa979e4e33d3f6e8b6788a744562/tumblr_o76kibBuTh1qzqfdio1_540.jpg (It doesn't look a lot like him though =/)
