I couldn't tell who it was sorry :( I always find portraits of real-life people difficult to get accurately (maybe I'll attempt Nathan Fillion one of these days too)

Aside from the eyes, I find that the shape of the lower half of the face particularly on the left side of the image feels quite different from the original. The smile is a bit wider on the original too. 

Good luck!
