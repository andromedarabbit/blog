Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [What is the Tagalog translation for "deeply"?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Tagalog-translation-for-deeply/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Adverbs don’t work the same way in Tagalog as they do in English. Most adverbs will be a phrase combining an adjective with something else, with the exact form depending on context, usually “nang”.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">For example, “deeply”’s root adjective is “deep”, which is “malalim” in Tagalog.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">“He was stabbed deeply by a knife” -&gt; “Sinaksak sya <b>nang malalim</b> gamit ang kutsilyo”</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">“I loved her deeply” -&gt; Minahal ko sya <b>nang malalim.</b></p></span>
