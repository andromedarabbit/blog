#### Posted on r/civ: [Is there a way to legally get a digital copy of Civ 1 and 2?](https://reddit.com/r/civ/comments/4y9sri/is_there_a_way_to_legally_get_a_digital_copy_of/)

I was thinking that in anticipation of Civ 6, I would play a game each of Civ 1-5. I have 3-5 on Steam, but any copy of Civ 1 and 2 have been lost to the sands of time
