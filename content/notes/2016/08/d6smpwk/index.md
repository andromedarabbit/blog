As a Filipino living in the Philippines, I can tell you he's not exactly the most consistent person spewing out reliable statements. Even during the campaign period he had a tendency to flip-flop especially when people call him out, and even his own spokespeople often give different "interpretations" of his nonsenical ramblings. If you believe he doesn't want to stay in power, you should also believe his threat to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court to declare martial law if she doesn't toe the line, or his threat to leave the UN if they aren't more polite or something
