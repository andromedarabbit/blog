#### Posted on r/OCPoetry: [Some days you are tired](https://reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/4ws35m/some_days_you_are_tired/)

Some days you are tired  
Maybe you are tired of all the work  
That piles up and never seems to end  
Of the endless meetings and reports  
That seemingly come again and again  

Some days you are tired  
Maybe you are tired of all the time  
That you never have enough of  
Of all the deadlines and targets  
That you never meet but should've  

Some days you are tired  
Maybe you are tired of the world  
And how it's unfair and never learns  
Of all the madness and insanity  
And sometimes you want to watch it burn  

Some days you are tired  
Maybe you are tired of people  
And all of their pressure and expectations  
Of all their lies and inconsistencies  
Or disappointments in their decisions  

And on some other days  
It's more of the same  

But also maybe you see a smile in a child's eyes  
Or maybe you run into a long-lost friend from years ago  
Or maybe someone laughs at a stupid joke you said  
Or maybe you see a stranger help another  
Or maybe you find a new favorite place to eat  
Or maybe you solve a problem tearing you up inside  
Or maybe a familiar tune plays on the radio  
Or maybe finally you're no longer in the red  
Or maybe good fortune comes to your brother  
Or maybe you find some time alone to breathe  

And you say to yourself "Maybe tomorrow,  
I will not be so tired"
