> [I perform poorly on boring tasks at my software engineering job. Should I feel guilty?](https://www.quora.com/I-perform-poorly-on-boring-tasks-at-my-software-engineering-job-Should-I-feel-guilty/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">A lot of software developers deal with legacy code and horribly-designed systems, it's hard to avoid. But the great thing with being a software developer is that we have a lot of avenues to apply creativity to boring tasks. Try to automate the boring parts, then you can get more work done. Or maybe build a tool to help map the horribly-designed system to make it easier to manage. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If your job doesn't allow you to do these sort of things, well I'd start looking for another job ;p</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"></p></span>
