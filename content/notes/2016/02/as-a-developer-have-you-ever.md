Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [As a developer, have you ever been in a situation where you couldn't fulfil one of your boss requests?](https://www.quora.com/As-a-developer-have-you-ever-been-in-a-situation-where-you-couldnt-fulfil-one-of-your-boss-requests/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">This is actually a very common scenario when you have a nontechnical boss. In fact as a software developer it's very much part of your job description to be able to assess business requirements and tell your boss/client if they are not feasible or even possible to do.</p></span>
