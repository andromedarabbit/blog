> [How do I stop worrying about others who are more intelligent, more talented?](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-stop-worrying-about-others-who-are-more-intelligent-more-talented/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Ask yourself what you're worried about. It's not a crime to be average</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There's a simple truth in life: for almost all people, there's always someone better</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">You can try to improve or better yourself, but you should be doing it for your own benefit, not so you can compare favorably to other people. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">How hard you work and what level of skill or talent you try to achieve should be dependent entirely on you and what you want for yourself, not on other people</p></span>
