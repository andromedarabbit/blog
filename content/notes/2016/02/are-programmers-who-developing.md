> [Are programmers who developing OS or any software writing more lines in the source code that are not necessary in order to work longer time?](https://www.quora.com/Are-programmers-who-developing-OS-or-any-software-writing-more-lines-in-the-source-code-that-are-not-necessary-in-order-to-work-longer-time/answer/Roy-Tang)

<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you need to fill up extra time, there are far better things to do than make up fake lines of code. The only reason I could think to do so would be if your company evaluates you based on LOC output. And if your company does that, you might want to consider leaving since it's ridiculous.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you have extra time at work and need to fill it, the most productive things to do would be either to write unit tests or refactor some of the wonky parts</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start"></p></span>
