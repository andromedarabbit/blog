<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Some things to try:</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">1. Try to remember your goals - why are you doing this thing in the first place? Imagine yourself achieving that goal. Is it worth it to power through the difficulty and get there?</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">2. Try to figure out the next step to get there, don't worry about how many other steps there are in front, just worry about the next step</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">3. Take a break. Let your subconscious mind stew on the problem for a while</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">4. Find something that pumps you up. Maybe have a confidence-boosting playlist</p></span>
