<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">It's hard to answer unless you have specific goals, but here are some tips:</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">1. Learn to save. Some say 10 or maybe 20% of your income, but I'd say "as much as you can"</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">2.
