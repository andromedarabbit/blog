<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Itâ€™s almost certainly market-driven. While the core, long-time gamers are used to having single-player campaigns to enjoy on their own, the mass market is more focused on multiplayer, both offline and online, so we will continue to find many of the bigger AAA releases deciding to focus less resources on single-player stuff</p></span>
