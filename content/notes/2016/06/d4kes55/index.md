This is already on the second visit to Lignatore. I had already defeated the boss and there was the cutscene and everything, then I realized I didn't get this box and I probably won't be able to get it. I still have this save game that's right before the boss before I go to Mysticete, wondering if whatever is in there is worth re-loading to try to get it :p
