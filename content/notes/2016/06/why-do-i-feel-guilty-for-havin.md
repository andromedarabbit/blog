Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [Why do I feel guilty for having a good life?](https://www.quora.com/Why-do-I-feel-guilty-for-having-a-good-life/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There is no need to feel guilty about your background, that’s not really something under your control or something you can change.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Being close-minded however, you can do something about that. While you may never fully understand their situation, that shouldn’t stop you from being able to empathize with them. Spend some time with people worse off than you, treat them to a meal every so often, listen to their stories, see what you can do for them.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There is great inequality in this world. It’s something we may never be able to eradicate. But that shouldn’t stop us from trying, from reaching out to one another and trying to connect, even with those who live different lives than us</p></span>
