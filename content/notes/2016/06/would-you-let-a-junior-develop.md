Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [Would you let a junior developer be the only developer on a project?](https://www.quora.com/Would-you-let-a-junior-developer-be-the-only-developer-on-a-project/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There are projects where it would be acceptable. Generally small, low-risk projects where there is a sufficient library of similar enough projects for the junior developer to reference how to do the more difficult common stuff (security, auth, audit trails, etc)</p></span>
