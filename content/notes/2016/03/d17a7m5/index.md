I didn't mean to imply that they are good candidates (I agree my wording was poor here, IDK about Sanders, but Trump certainly isn't a "good" candidate), but rather that they are taking advantage of a subset of voters that is known to be previously not participating in the elections by offering something significantly different from the establishment candidates.
