> You're ignoring the fact that this election is not just about the president.

Er, didn't I say that even if abstaining for president you should consider voting for VP and senators?

> While I personally don't have a problem with people not voting for a president, the least evil argument is pretty valid here. Heck, look at the anti-Binay sentiments you see all over.

If you want to vote for someone just so Binay doesn't win, that's fine. But the last time people voted for a candidate just so the supposed terrible candidate would not win, we got GMA as president, so there's that to consider. It's something I'm considering as well
