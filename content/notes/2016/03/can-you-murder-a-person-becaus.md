<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">No. Not even if you think they deserve it. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Not even considering the fact that legally it is a crime. Even if you find a way to make it legal (self-defense, etc)</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Live and let live. If you hate a person, just avoid that person as much as possible. Don't let him change you.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">There is already too much death in the world for us to willingly want to contribute more.</p></span>
