I have a number of otherwise intelligent friends who often post things in favor of certain candidates that are obviously biased. And if you call them out on their bias they will just be all defensive and ask if you have a better idea, etc.

Like literally, one of my friends posted something along the lines of:

"Candidate A - lists negative points; Candidate B - lists negative points; Candidate C - lists positive points. Easy decision right?"

Not even pretending to be fair or anything. 

It's normal to be turned off by such things, especially for people who are truly undecided and trying to weigh pros and cons of the candidates. I try to stay informed and read everything even the biased ones post, but I tend to give more weight to those who I know to be undecided and are trying to be objective.

I have to agree that none of the presidential candidates look good enough (at the moment, at least), and I wouldn't object to abstaining the presidential slot. Abstaining is a vote too, in and of itself.

Edit: If you also find that none of the candidates meet your standards and are considering abstaining, you might want to read this: http://www.businessmirror.com.ph/abstain4president2016/

But at the very least consider voting for the other positions. There is (in my opinion) at least one worthy candidate in the VP slot, and your vote could help some of the more worthy senators get past the cringe-worthy ones in the bottom half (sadly, I think we're going to have to live with another term of Senator Sotto)
