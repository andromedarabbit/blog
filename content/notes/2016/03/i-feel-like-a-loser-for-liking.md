Someone on [quora](https://quora.com) asked:
> [I feel like a loser for liking/caring for a girl who probably doesn't even think of me. What can I do about it?](https://www.quora.com/I-feel-like-a-loser-for-liking-caring-for-a-girl-who-probably-doesnt-even-think-of-me-What-can-I-do-about-it/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Stop thinking of yourself as a loser and just move on. Try to avoid thinking about this girl and don't hang out with her unless absolutely necessary. Moving on from someone isn't easy, you need to be dedicated to it.</p></span>
