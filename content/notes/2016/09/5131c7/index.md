#### Posted on r/Stellaris: [Have there been a lot of changes since release? Do we have a window for the release of the Heinlein patch?](https://reddit.com/r/Stellaris/comments/5131c7/have_there_been_a_lot_of_changes_since_release_do/)

I haven't played the game since before the first patch (Asimov?), am I in for a treat/different game altogether?

Do we have a release window for Heinlein? I read that savegames will be incompatible after the patch so I'll wait until that comes out before playing Stellaris again
