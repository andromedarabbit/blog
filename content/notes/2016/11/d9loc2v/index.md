This reminds me of back when the footbridge near the corner of Commonwealth and Tandang Sora was still under construction. At that time pedestrians could already climb up one side even though it was not yet done, so at one point I saw it and was like "cool, may footbridge na pala", went up and got to the halfway point only to find that it didn't reach all the way to the end /glare
