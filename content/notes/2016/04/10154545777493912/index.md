For those of you who know how to reddit: I've started a thread over on r/Philippines to crowdsource information on senatorial candidates, baka gusto nyo mag contribute: https://www.reddit.com/r/Philippines/comments/4fdl1h/2016_senatorial_candidates_information_megathread/  (For those of you who *don't* reddit, maybe I'll compile all the info into a spreadsheet at some point to help with my own decision-making and share it later)
