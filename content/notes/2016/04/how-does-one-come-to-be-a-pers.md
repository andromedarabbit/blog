Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [How does one come to be a person where "there is nothing he/she CAN'T do"?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-one-come-to-be-a-person-where-there-is-nothing-he-she-CANT-do/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">First, there is no such thing as a person who can do everything, no matter how much it looks like that. That being said, it's a reasonably good goal to try to be that kind of person</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">And like many things, it's largely confidence. It's largely believing that you are capable of anything you put your mind to (within limits of course - if you are physically disabled it might be unreasonable to try to become an olympic gold medal winner in the 100 meter dash or somesuch). And even if you don't believe that you can do it - fake it til you make it. You are who you believe yourself to be</p></span>
