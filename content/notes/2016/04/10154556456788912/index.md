Some other things I noted in the debate:

1. Duterte no longer harping on "3-6 months"
2. Roxas no longer mentioning "Daang Matuwid" (although he did use tuwid as an adjective a couple of times I think)
3. Isko Moreno has *a lot* of ads. He must have had like 3-4 different ads shown during the debate
4. ABS' silly drama scenes before each question were a waste of time better used for asking more questions
5. We LOLed every time Binay took the opportunity to walk forward to answer. Baka kulang pa sya ng exercise for that day
