I feel like there's already an abundance of information on the presidential candidates. People just need to decide which flaws they are willing to overlook. That being said, I do have a spreadsheet I've been using to help decide, but it is quite specific to my own stand on the issues. If you are still undecided you may find it useful: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MTPMAhGCiG_7jWC0vLNnJNQLPXGbBBLlfHri8-RqgaI/edit?usp=sharing

For VP, I have no inputs as I have already made my choice.
