Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [What are the differences between JSP and Servlets?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-differences-between-JSP-and-Servlets/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">JSPs are actually compiled into Java servlets on the server-side anyway. Their main purpose is to make it easier to write and maintain HTML/CSS/JS since doing that in an actual servlet includes writing a lot of out.print statements.</p></span>
