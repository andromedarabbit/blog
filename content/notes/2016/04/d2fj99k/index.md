From http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/730238/profiles-liberal-partys-senatorial-slate: "Drilon said: Recto is the most hardworking and one of the most productive senators. He has authored bills for free health insurance for senior citizens, special discount for persons with disability, and the scrapping of tax in 13th-month pay bonus."
