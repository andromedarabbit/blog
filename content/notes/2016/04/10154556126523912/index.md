In my opinion, the performances at today's debate (from best to worst) were:

1. Roxas
2. Poe
3. Santiago
4. Duterte
5. Binay

The debate wasn't too exciting, although may konting immature fireworks between two certain candidates.

BONUS: In my opinion, the debates (in terms of format and moderator performances) can be ranked (from best to worst) as follows:

1. 2nd debate (TV5)
2. 3rd debate (ABS)
3. 1st debate (GMA)

Edit: Swapped #3 and #4 because my someone reminded me of somethings Miriam said and I remembered that stupid Emilio Aguinaldo reply
