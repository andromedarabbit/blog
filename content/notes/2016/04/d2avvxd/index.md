Lacson has been linked to two issues during his tenure in the PNP:

- the coverup of the Kuratong Baleleng rubout

- the Dacer-Corbito double murder

Both cases have been dismissed by the courts

More recently, he served to coordinate rehab and recovery efforts after Yolanda.

While in the Senate, Lacson never availed of the PDAF.

- Republic Act No. 9160, as amended by Republic Act 9194, otherwise known as the Anti-Money Laundering Act

- Republic Act No. 9163, The National Service Training Program (NSTP) Act of 2001
