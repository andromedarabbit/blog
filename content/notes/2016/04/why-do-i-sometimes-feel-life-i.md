<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Life is just about as interesting as you choose to make it. If you feel a lack of challenge in your life, you might want to try upping the difficulty level a bit. Or explore life to find new things and challenges and expand your horizons.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Ask for more responsibilities at work.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Look for new interesting hobbies.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Hang out at places you don't usually hang out.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Meet new people. Preferably smarter people. People who can challenge you.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Live life to the fullest!</p></span>
