Someone on [quora]() asked:
> [Is life full of unlimited opportunities?](https://www.quora.com/Is-life-full-of-unlimited-opportunities/answer/Roy-Tang)
<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Optimists will say yes. Pessimists will say no. Both are correct.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">If you are willing to seek out and/or create those opportunities, then yes there is no limit to the opportunities available to you. If not, if you just sit around all day and complain about how things are bad for you, then your opportunities will be limited</p></span>
