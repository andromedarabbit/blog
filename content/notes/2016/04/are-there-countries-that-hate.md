<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">I think it's mostly Filipinos who hate the Philippines.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">Aside from that, there have been some individuals who voice out racist/hatred for Filipinos in general, but I don't think there's such a thing as an entire country hating us</p></span>
