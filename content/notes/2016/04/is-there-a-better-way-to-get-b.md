<span class="ui_qtext_rendered_qtext"><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">In general, the best answer to "how can I get better at X" is to keep practicing X until you get better. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">That being said, there are some ways to make it easier to deal with rejection. Most of it has to do with improving your state of mind.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">What does that mean? It doesn't mean conditioning yourself to expect rejection (that would be a self-fulfilling prophecy right there!) but rather to detach your ego from the attempts you make. </p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">The reason rejection can be so difficult to handle is that it's a huge ego hit, it makes you feel bad about yourself, as if there's something wrong with you that's why you got rejected. And that's nonsense.</p><p class="ui_qtext_para u-ltr u-text-align--start">People get rejected all the time. Good people, bad people. Handsome people, ugly people. Rich people, poor people. A rejection isn't a reflection of something wrong with you as a person, it's a reflection of something wrong with the relationship you were trying to form. And that's the nature of the world - not all persons are meant to have relationships together! This can apply to romantic relationships, business relationships, friendships, etc. Once you accept this truth, it becomes a lot easier to handle rejection.</p></span>
