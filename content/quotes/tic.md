These are quotes (allegedly) made by me, compiled by people I know over the years, supposedly because I am a spout of wisdom (?). (Some of them are just me quoting other things, but the people who compiled this list didn't get the reference.)

There is also [a Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/tangincheek) that randomly tweets one of these per day, if you're into that sort of thing.

### 1

Difficult tasks are like drugs: just say 'No'.

---

### 2

it might have been a terrible plan, but sometimes we need to go through the terrible things to make the nonterrible things better

---

### 3

On learning how to make code readable: "These are things you must 
seek out on your own."

---

### 4

"I can choose to pass on the bestness"

---

### 5

Let's worry about that in the future 

---

### 6

This is true

---

### 7

Stop quoting me

---

### 8

---

### 15

---

### 16

<hunter> I suggest you doublecheck your facts!
<hunter> in fact, trees are plants

---

### 17

this can only end in le disaster

---

### 18

---

### 19

---

### 36

<hunter> wala na kong sin
<hunter> i'm immaculate

---

### 37

---

### 38

appearances

tawagin na cleaning agent

---

### 572

it's because you dont care

---

### 573

we should all resign and be hermits

---

### 574

<hunter> then it's a paradox
<hunter> baka naimpress sila kay mole
<hunter> then they're like "all testers should be like him!" 

---

### 575

### 587

<hunter> this is impossible for us to evaluate, do you know why
<hunter> it's because she's a woman

<hunter> we can only evaluate stuff that makes sense 

---

### 588
