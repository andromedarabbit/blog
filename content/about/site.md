**roytang.net**

- [roytang.net](https://roytang.net) is a personal site, an [E/N site](http://sawv.org/en.html), and kind of a [commonplace book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book)
- I post about a random assortment of topics that interest me including [software development](/tags/software-development/), [Magic the Gathering](/tags/magic-the-gathering/), [pop culture](/tags/pop-culture), [gaming](/tags/gaming), and [tech life](tags). This site is [perpetually under renovation](/2019/08/perpetually-under-renovation/).
- I've had a site on the internet since around 2001, in some form or another. 
- I've had the domain roytang.net [since 2002](/2006/02/welcome-to-roytang-net/). 
- You can view a [changelog](/tags/changelog) of this site. 
- The site is perpetually under construction, as we all are.
- This site is statically generated using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) with a custom theme that I internally call "Exhale" for some reason.
- The [source for this website is available on Github](https://github.com/roytang/blog). 
- Dynamic content on this website is supported by a ragtag collection of Python scripts and third-party services.
  - Comments are handled via a custom comments backend written in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
  - Search is handled via a custom search backend using [Flask](https://palletsprojects.com/p/flask/) and [Whoosh](https://whoosh.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html). (TODO: Merge the Flask backend into the Django backend)
  - Webmentions are handled via webmention.io.
  - content I post on Twitter, Instagram and other services are fed back into this site via custom Python scripts.
- This site is hosted on [Webfaction](https://www.webfaction.com/?aid=7808) (affiliate link). 
- An off-site mirror/backup is generated every so often to [https://roytang.github.io/](https://roytang.github.io/).
