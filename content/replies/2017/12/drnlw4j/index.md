Jeff: "Filipinos, really. When taxes were high, complain a lot. When taxes removed, still complain. Prices were high even before? All complaints"\n\nMake: "My 2016 vote was worth it. Not a traditional politician. My time queueing in the precinct wasn't wasted at all. Duterte is the one with compassion for the citizens and the poor."\nMark (reply to Make): "So that's why he only kills the poor. Okay got it"\n\nMs: "With or without tax reform prices would have gone up, as if we had a choice... just be thrifty so that your income is enough"\n\nArt: "Let's not blame the TRAIN for the rising prices. Whether there is TRAIN or not, prices will go up. Don't bring the poor into the higher taxes for the rich. Better than the middle class suffering."\n\nJN: "Filipinos are all complaints. At least you're holding your entire salary and its up to you how you budget it. Avoid luxuries so that you can save!"\n\nMikasa: (This one is already English)\n\nMark: "I prefer holding every month the money that gets cut (for taxes) which I can't do anything about. I'll think harder about what's worth it and what's not needed. That's called wise spending."\n\nApril: (The full name isn't blacked out, is it a rules violation here?) "Let's learn self-control. You don't need to spend everyday on expensive food or on liquor you're just going to piss out afterwards. Once a month to enjoy your hard work should be okay. You shouldn't be like a one day millionaire once you get money in your hands. Think about what's good for you and your health."
