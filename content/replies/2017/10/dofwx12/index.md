Well, if it's true that the new jeeps are more profitable in the long run for the drivers, why do we need to enforce the phaseout? Why not let drivers choose whether to use the old models or the new ones, and let the old model die out naturally to market forces?\n\nI mean, I get all the benefits, but these jeepney drivers don't really earn that much. Anlaki ng cost for them nung new models, so mahihirapan talaga sila if we force them to transition.
