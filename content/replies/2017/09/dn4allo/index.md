One more pa pala, I forgot: 121 Allegro. Looks like they still have a weekly quiz night and next one is on the 19th. https://web.facebook.com/121resto/photos/a.357381667620914.106804.357345567624524/2106628202696243/?type=3\n\nI've never gone here though I only heard of it from some other quiz night people. I think pop culture stuff din sya, but IDK sino naghohost.
