Mas madalas sa ortigas area. PopQuiz has 1-2 per month sa ortigas. Siguro once every 3 months may makati. Geekfight dati makati then mga two years ago madalas ortigas but right now on hiatus sila. There's also an irish pub on rufino, murphys that used to have pub quiz on tuesdays, not sure if meron pa now havent been there for a while (and mahirap ung murphys less pop culture and more academic topics - history science etc)
