I have a couple of friends who only ever open Duelyst every day to play the daily challenges. I guess they're out now.\n\nI understand that it's difficult to keep producing such content on a daily basis (when I started three months ago I was amazed they had such a feature), but I would have hoped they'd at least re-run old challenges or maybe make them available in an archive.
