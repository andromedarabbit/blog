I think of an organization plan, start organizing by set, then give up halfway through because I have way too many cards.\n\nSeriously: I have a whole bunch of commons/uncommons in  drawers, organized by set. Rares/mythics are in separate fat pack boxes per color. Everything sorted alphabetically! (But yes, I'm not yet done with the commons. Ran out of drawers!)
