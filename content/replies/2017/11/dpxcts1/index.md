Aside from all the great advice here (save first before spending, etc), tell your friends about this problem and ask them to help you improve. Tell them to call you out if it looks like you're spending too much. Tell them to tempt you to buy food then slap you in the face pag kumagat ka naman. And if you tell them about this problem, they might even decline when di ka makatiis manlibre.
