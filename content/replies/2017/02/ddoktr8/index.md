I'm not an American. How common are these sort of free food promos done in the States?\n\nWhere I am, there's sometimes things like McDonald's gives a free burger to the first 100 visitors or Krispy Kreme randomly giving out free donuts to people in line, I'm not sure if it's similar stuff involved in this site.
