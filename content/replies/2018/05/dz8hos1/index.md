Putting your picture on your resume when your appearance shouldnt have any effect on the job you're applying for is a silly thing Pinoys do that should end. It contributes to a culture of shallowness where people judge you based on your appearance.

Aside from it being better for society, you would probably not want to work at the sort of places that expect your resume to have a picture.

That being said, if you have any sort of facebook presence, you can be sure you're gonna get online-stalked before any intervieew.
