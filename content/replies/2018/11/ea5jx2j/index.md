This was in the Philippines in the 90s. Our English high school reading list: Lord of the Flies, The Kitchen God's Wife, Things Fall Apart were the ones I remember. After that I think it was mostly Asian classics like the Ramayana. We also had Filipino lit which covered works by Florante Balagtas and Jose Rizal.
