I don't think we should ban Lantern or Ensnaring Bridge, but I wouldn't mind printing sth like 

Shatterstar
Artifact
(1)
R, Sacrifice ~: Destroy target artifact. 
Whenever ~ is put into your graveyard or the exile zone from your library, exile all artifacts.

Edit: Change to "Whenever ~ is put into your graveyard or the exile zone from your library, you may pay 1RR. If you do, exile all artifacts."
