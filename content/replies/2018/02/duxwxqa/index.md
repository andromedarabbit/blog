The only scenario I can think of ATM where I want to go back to the previous column is when I want to modify the indentation of a line to be aligned to the previous column. In this scenario, does your editor not support backspace to go back to the previous column? (I actually had to open sublime to figure out how I do it since it's so instinctive for me right now)

Or is there another scenario I'm missing out on?
