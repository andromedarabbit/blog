Not that I disagree with the sentiment, but as I recall the IRA doesn't reflect the entire revenue allotment, so the comparison isn't entirely fair. I imagine that of the portion of the revenue spent by the national govt (the part that doesnt go to the LGUs), a more significant portion of the right graph goes to metro manila. Probably the comparison is still valid, but maybe a little less skewed. Would be nice to have a more accurate comparison.
