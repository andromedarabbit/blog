Saying all games should have a certain trait is a bit like saying all movies should be the same genre. It's ok that there are games that are hard - theyre not for casuals. And complaining that not everybody gets to experience those games or their content is a it like complaining that not everybody gets to enjoy twilight. Surprise - different people like different things!
