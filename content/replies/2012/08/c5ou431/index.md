    piracy is like playing the world''s largest game of Whac-A-Mole. "Sooner or later,
    the people who still believe they can hit the moles with their slow mallets might
    realize that their time would be better spent playing an entirely different game."''

Piracy doesn't let you own the games either. Valve still owns Half-Life even if you pirate it.
