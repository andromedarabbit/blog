These are all very different games. Super Meat Boy and VVVVV focus on difficulty and twitch-gaming, while Braid and Trine are more of puzzle platformers. AYIM I didn't like at all lol.

When I say a Mario-like game, I mean something that focuses on exploration I guess? Trine is probably the closest among the ones you mentioned.
