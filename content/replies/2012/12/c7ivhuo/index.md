The stories in the books always take place at the time they were written. Older stories adjust to the timeline of the book you're reading as needed. 

When the original x-men were introduced, their story took place in the 60s and that's still true if you're reading uncanny x-men v1 #1. 

But when you read all new xmen #1 which takes place in 2012, the story of the original xmen happened 15-20 years ago. This means that their story doesnt have exactly the same setting as it did in uxm#1, although the details remain more or less the same. 

It's a bit weird. Best not to take comic book timelines too seriously lol.
