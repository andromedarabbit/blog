For me it's not. I haven't really cared about Pacquiao that much; I'm not the type of person that would be proud of someone just because we randomly happened to be born in the same country.\n\nThat being said, he really should have quit his game when he went into politics. His being in politics annoys me more than this loss.\n\nFun story, I was playing a game on my PC (Saints Row the Third if you're curious) and my dad was like "Wala pa bang balita kay Pacquiao", and I was like "nagstart na ba? I'll check later", but by the time I was finished playing (about 2 hours later) the fight was already done. Lol hindi ko man lang naramdaman. How long did that fight last anyway
