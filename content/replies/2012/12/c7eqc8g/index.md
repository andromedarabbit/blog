In that case, do you know what were the circumstances leading to the ruling that the player forgot the trigger? Is it because the attacking player made no sign of any sort to acknowledge the trigger? \n\nI would think swinging a Pyreheart Wolf into an Augur of Bolas that could block and kill it without the trigger means he was expecting to get through with damage. I guess that's what bothering a lot of people, such an attack seems to indicate that you assume you're getting through and therefore are aware of the trigger.\n\nHow about the story the other day of a craterhoof player saying he was attacking for lethal, and the opponent later claiming that the craterhoof trigger had been missed. (I believe this was from the Melissa deTora article). Is this also "not a great example"?\n\nBTW, I fully support this discussion and agree that on its face the current trigger rules are probably better than earlier incarnations, I just want a clearer guideline of when I would be considered to have forgotten my trigger.\n\nEdit: Fixed some words
