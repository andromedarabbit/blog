Right about Kyle. I went back and re-read the first few issues of New Guardians. He was the 2nd GL in our sector as of the start of the series, but was "fired" as of the 3rd issue. I don't know if they ever got another lantern to replace him for the sector, since they didn't actually got the ring off him.
