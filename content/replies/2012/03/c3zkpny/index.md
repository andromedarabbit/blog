> "Hey, lets just delay this a bit and make a really good game, packed to the brim with content that our fans want."\n\nWhat is the correct threshold for this? How do they determine when they have "enough" characters or content? How do they know when it's already "packed to the brim"?\n\nIt's not like video games can be "full", it's always possible to keep adding stuff\n
