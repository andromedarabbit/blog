I dislike the whole thing not because of the DRM (I don't even see Steam as DRM), I dislike it because the Origin service at the moment is crappy. They don't have the same amount of sales Steam does, and their customer service is horrid (there are horror stories about Steam customer service)

I'm all for having a competing service to Steam, but hopefully that competing service is a good one that forces Steam to innovate and improve to keep up (not that they're doing a bad job at the moment). Origin is nowhere near that yet.

Mass Effect 3 being exclusive to Origin isn't a bad thing per se, but it's a bit like a much anticipated game being exclusive to a console that only 5% of the market uses - the other 95% are sad, but we just move on because our platform of choice already has a vastly superior library anyway.
