How high does he think online piracy should rank in terms of America (and the world's) priorities? Aren't there a multitude of more pressing problems regarding poverty, education, unemployment, healthcare that the governments should focus on?\n\nHow does he compare the "no due process" provisions of SOPA (allowing websites to be shut down without need for evidence or hearing) to the constitutional guarantee of "innocent until proven guilty"?\n\nIs the MPAA even considering developing alternative business models that work with the internet instead of trying to destroy it?
