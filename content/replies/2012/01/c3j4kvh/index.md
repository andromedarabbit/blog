No offense, but you were probably applying for the wrong companies (obvious if you consider they have some sort of padrino system), either that or you were aiming for jobs you werent qualified for. Not only have i found my current job without any sort of connections, i do not personally know anyone who needed connections to land their job. I've also interviewed dozens of applicants for entry level positions, everytime i had to fail an applicant it was because he didnt have the talent we needed, connections never came into play.
