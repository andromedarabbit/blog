I think the year in parenthesis is the year the series started. It makes sense for most of them, but not for Amazing Spider-Man. Pretty sure it didn't start in 1999. Shrug.

For series to jump into, do you want to follow an ongoing series? If yes, the recent ones that I like: Daredevil (< 10 issues), Uncanny X-Men (they rebooted last year, only 5 issues so far), Uncanny X-Force (this is around 20 issues in), Wolverine and the X-Men (5 issues), Defenders (only 2 issues in! I like the art). The X-books might be a bit harder to pick up if you're not familiar with the characters as they reference a lot of previous storylines.

You might be interested in the Ultimate line, it's basically a separate universe they started around 10 years ago that has less back story for a new reader to follow. They have some ongoing series currently, namely Ultimate Comics Spider-Man (6 issues in, this Spider-Man is not Peter Parker), Ultimate Comics X-Men (6 issues) and Ultimate Comics The Ultimates (6 issues). If you want to go back farther, I suggest picking up trades of Ultimate Spider-Man (this was the first Ultimate book, and it ended last year) and Ultimate X-Men.

If you want some Avengers, they have several series ongoing. Avengers, New Avengers and Secret Avengers are all okay, and they're all in the 20+ issue range. I like New Avengers best among the three, I need to catch up on Secret Avengers
