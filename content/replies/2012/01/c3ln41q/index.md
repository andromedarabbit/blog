Most Filipinos already speak English, I don't think there will be a big enough market (there are too many people here who can teach English). Although there are also a lot of Koreans who come here to learn English, so I dunno. Shrug. Your best bet might be English accent training for call centers (locals can't compete with a native American English speaker in this field) OR teaching at international schools (they may prefer expats)\n\nHaha sorry for not being very helpful.
