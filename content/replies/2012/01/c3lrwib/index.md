The book is great, except I find the pacing horribly slow. I understand  they're taking it slow deliberately because they're targetting new readers who may or may not be familiar with the rest of the league, but I feel like with a bit tighter pacing they could have gotten the current 5-issue plot in 3 issues or so.

Maybe I just got spoiled by Morrison's JLA run. By issue 5, Morrison was already on the second story arc!
