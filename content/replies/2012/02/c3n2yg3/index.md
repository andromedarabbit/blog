Are you suggesting that r/gaming should be filled with posts begging for stuff? You're not the only poor gamer you know.

r/gaming is not averse to giveaways, but the supply of people who can giveaway stuff is a lot less than the people who want stuff, so it's more acceptable to post a thread giving away stuff than begging for stuff
