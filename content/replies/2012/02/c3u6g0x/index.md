They need to deliver the game to the console guys (Microsoft/Sony) for certification months before the release date (I believe for ME3 it was submitted for certification in January). So your suggestion is that even if they have a chance to work on additional content earlier, they should NOT do that at all? Like, just have those guys work on the old republic or something?
