Yeah, I was having a discussion about it with some friends just this week about how our prices and ISPs are generally terrible here compared to nearby countries such as HK and SG. Understandably, those guys are way ahead of us economically, so I guess the comms infrastructure comes into play when determining our broadband costs, but still the difference is like the gulf between the earth and the sun, it's really hard to find it justifiable.
