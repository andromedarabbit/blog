I wasn't too impressed with the final issue. Some nice sequences overall, but a number of parts seemed rushed, like how Peter explains things so quickly to Carlie, Miguel, the Avengers even. And the Goblin recognizing it was Peter after one line of banter?

I'm disappointed in how Norman got away. Spider-man gets stunned for one panel and suddenly he's gone and neither Peter nor Miguel bother to look for him? Obviously they ran out of space to wrap that up neatly, but jeez

I just felt it needed a bit more oomph as a series finale I guess. I suppose they'll be covering the repercussions of Otto's run in the months to come though
