Set some high-energy song as your alarm. I use "The Final Countdown"\n\nUse multiple alarms, spaced 20-35 minutes apart. Try setting the first alarm to be around 1-1.5 hours before you need to wake up. Adjust the number of alarms and the spacing and the initial time until you find a mix that works for you. You can use different tunes/songs for each alarm.\n\nAt one point I had something like 10-12 alarms, two of them were Final Countdown, five of them were some rooster crowing, and the others were alarm clock sounds. The earliest alarm came at around 5 AM while the last one fired at 8:10 AM (which at that time was the absolute latest time I could wake up without risking being late for work)
