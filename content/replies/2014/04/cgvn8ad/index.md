I've been in situations where I knew a friend was about to do something stupid that could ruin her life, but there was nothing I could do to stop it or dissuade her, all I could do was stand by and bear witness to the inevitable (metaphorical) train wreck that she would have to climb out of. It's terrible because you give advice and you feel like you're not listened to when you're only looking out for them and you're being completely sensible.

Sometimes you just have to let people make their own mistakes.
