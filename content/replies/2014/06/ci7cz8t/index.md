There is an incursion point that will destroy one of two earths (this is on the parallel earth). Only one Earth can survive. The New Avengers meet up with that world's superheroes to see if they have any options, but they have less than an hour to figure a way out. The New Avengers have a unthinkable backup plan - an antimatter bomb that would destroy the parallel earth and make them mass murderers. Namor is tired of the discussions and knows where it's all headed...
