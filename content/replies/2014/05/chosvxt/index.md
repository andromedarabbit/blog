I've been a big Street Fighter fan since forever, but I'm not too good at the game because of super-tight timings with one-frame links and stuff like that and not having enough time to practice my execution religiously. I'm planning to get Smash on 3ds, but I've never played the series before. Do you have any idea if it's generally as unforgiving as Street Fighter execution-wise?
