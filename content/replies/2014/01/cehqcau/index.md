Wild Ricochet is a legal target while it is resolving. The last step of spell resolution is:\n\n608.2k As the final part of an instant or sorcery spell's resolution, the spell is put into its owner's graveyard. As the final part of an ability's resolution, the ability is removed from the stack and ceases to exist.
