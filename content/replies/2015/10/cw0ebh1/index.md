Answers to common responses:\n\n> Bongbong isn't his father\n\nYes, but he and his family refuse to acknowledge the sins of his father and refuse to return the money they stole\n\n> Move on na from martial law\n\nWe can move on once the Marcoses atone and give reparations\n\n> You're free to vote someone else for VP\n\nThe choice of Marcos and the political compromise by itself speak towards Miriam's character. What compromises will she make if she gets elected?\n\n> It's a strategic/political choice to increase the chance to win\n\nThe ends don't justify the means. And I think the pro-Marcos crowd vastly overestimates their numbers. I think strategically this is a net negative
