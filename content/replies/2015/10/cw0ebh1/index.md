Answers to common responses:

> Bongbong isn't his father

Yes, but he and his family refuse to acknowledge the sins of his father and refuse to return the money they stole

> Move on na from martial law

We can move on once the Marcoses atone and give reparations

> You're free to vote someone else for VP

The choice of Marcos and the political compromise by itself speak towards Miriam's character. What compromises will she make if she gets elected?

> It's a strategic/political choice to increase the chance to win

The ends don't justify the means. And I think the pro-Marcos crowd vastly overestimates their numbers. I think strategically this is a net negative
