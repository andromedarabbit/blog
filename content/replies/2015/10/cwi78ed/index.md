Because I can afford to pay other people to do it? I've already assembled enough desktops when I was young and had a lot of free time. It's an easy waste of half a manday, maybe more if you make mistakes. If you have it assembled right there in the shop they'll spot any problems right away and you can replace any problematic parts immediately
