I understand where you're coming from, but to claim that Marvel doesn't make new heroes is maybe just a little bit disingenuous.\n\nCharacters on these covers that were introduced since the year 2000:\n\n- America Chavez (2011)\n- Silk (2014)\n- Spider-Gwen (2014)\n- Fantomex (2002)\n- Hulkling (2005)\n- Wiccan (2005)\n- Agent Coulson (2008)\n- Nico Minoru (2003)\n- Kamala Khan (Ms Marvel) (2013)\n- Half the people on the Web Warriors cover\n\nI'm not counting Miles since you don't seem to like that he's also "Spider-Man" even though that shouldn't really matter. There's also two people I don't recognize on the Uncanny Inhumans cover, IDK if they're new.
