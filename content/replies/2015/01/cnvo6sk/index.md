I'm surprisingly ok with this, and even slightly enthusiastic as to what might come out of it at the end.\n\nWhat I would hope for is that 616 doesn't "go away" or get destroyed or whatever (too much history there to throw away), but that we get a new "main universe" that combines some elements of both universes.\n\nSome random ideas for the new combined universe:\n\n- In this universe, the age of heroes already began earlier with Spider-Man, Fantastic Four, X-Men, already existing years prior. Think something like Watchmen where a previous generation of supers already existed. This solves some issues like Magneto being alive during the holocaust (we need to leave Magneto behind)\n\n- Peter Parker is retired as Spider-Man, living a quiet life with Mary Jane and their kid. We find out about this in a Spider-Man ongoing where the lead character is Miles trying to figure out what happened to the previous Spider-Man\n\n- Uncanny X-Men: Charles Xavier and his X-Men died some time ago during a violent confrontation with Magneto. The world finds out that Scott Summers actually survived and now he's come out calling for a new mutant revolution\n\n- X-Men: After Xavier's death, the government partnered with the remaining mutants to establish a franchise of schools in Xavier's memory to both train mutants and keep them under control. The schools are used by the government as secret training/recruitment grounds. As an initial story arc, I'd introduce a new villain who claims to be the son of Magneto, inheriting his powers\n\n- Someone here commented about the spider-verse totems taking on the role of the now defunct Captain Britain Corps. This sounds great! As an initial story arc, I'd have them go up against the surviving members of the Council of Reeds\n\n- no idea yet what to do with the avengers lol. I'd imagine a new series focusing on the formation of the team, i.e. they don't have to exist in the previous generation\n\n- cosmic stuff: Bendis hasn't actually done anything much with the Gu
