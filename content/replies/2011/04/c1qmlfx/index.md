Maybe she prepares everything ahead of time and just has shell scripts to run. That way she impresses all the noobs who have no idea how she does all this so fast. Do I get a no-prize?\n\nShe's about as bad as Garcia from Criminal Minds, who can basically search for any information in no time flat unless the plot gods say it's too difficult.\n\nMost of the time it doesn't bother me though. It's just TV.
