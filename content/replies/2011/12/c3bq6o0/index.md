nope, real life is harsher. sorry dude. 

i'm not trying to discourage you, but the "standard meta decks" are tuned by hundreds of players regularly, that's why they're standard. it's difficult for a lone player with a rogue deck to match the level of tuning these decks have. 

i'm not saying you can't do it, there's a chance you've hit on some interesting concept that may crush a lot of other decks out there. or maybe you're a deckbuilding genius savant, i dunno.
