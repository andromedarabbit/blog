I like the Civ DLC. I don't enjoy map packs, but then again I don't have to buy them. But I like the additional civs being added every now and then. Keeps the game fresh. In fact, I'd like to have as many civs as possible, but I don't want to have to wait forever for that game. And with Steam, I never have to buy them full price, I just wait for the next big sale. 

I also don't mind not having religion or corporations, I already have Civ4 for that. :D
