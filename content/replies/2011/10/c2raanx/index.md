Upvotes for this. I posted the following message:\n\n"Why are multitouch gestures not enabled in iOS5 for iPad1? I've been using them for months in developer mode without any problems so I'm sure the hardware can handle it. Please patch it back in, this makes me want to jailbreak"\n\nNo idea if it will work, but maybe if enough of us do it they'll take notice :D
