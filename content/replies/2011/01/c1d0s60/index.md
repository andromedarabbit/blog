Really? Did you get that from the multiple game of the year awards it garnered? :p\n\nDunno whether bnet is "shitty" or not but I've personally logged more than 500 games online, and I'm no pro just a casual player mostly. Hundreds of games are ongoing at any one time on bnet, I'm not sure under what definition of shitty that qualifies.\n\nTldr sc2 is an awesome game
