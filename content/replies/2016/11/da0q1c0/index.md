Hello, I hope you find the time to answer my questions :)\n\nI read the Sword of Truth series (up to Confessor - I have not read any of the later books) perhaps a decade ago. I enjoyed the series for the most part, but I always felt that the first few books were the strongest, and towards the end of the series (starting around Faith of the Fallen) I felt that the characters had become a bit too...shall we say "preachy" about their particular worldviews.\n\nMy questions are:\n\n- Did you initially plan the series to be so many books?\n\n- Was it originally your plan to introduce philosophical themes such as Objectivist ideas later on in the books?\n\n- Which parts of the series would you say are the strongest and you are most proud of?\n\n- Any technical advice you would give to an aspiring fantasy writer trying to get a book sold?\n\nThanks!\n\n
