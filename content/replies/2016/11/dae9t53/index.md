Report the page. They are actively encouraging people to indulge in criminal activity. Even if you're a Duterte supporter you should report the page because frankly, these idiots make you look so bad. At the very least comment on the thread to share your disapproval.\n\nThis is why some friends of mine believe we are already under a "virtual martial law" - why would the state bother to repress our rights when citizens are actively self-organizing to help repress other people's rights (either with or without the prodding of political actors - I'm not sure which is the more terrifying option)\n\nAlso, natatawa ako that they credit the idea to a certain Salim McDoom. Literal supervillain name right there.
