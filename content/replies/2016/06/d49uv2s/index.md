The building had a nondescript white exterior, with a single grey metal door on the facade and no other hint of what lie within. I tried the knob and a metallic rattle told me it was locked. I frowned, then remembered, then pulled out the mysterious envelope I had found under my door yesterday. I mean, 93 years from now. Well, not 93 years from now for me. Yesterday for me. God, I need to figure out how to think of time again.\n\nI opened the envelope, equally nondescript as the building exterior, and shook it a bit. The small key fell out of it and I almost miss catching it. Harold would have sneered derisively if he was here. "World's clumsiest time traveller!" he would have said.\n\nHarold. Harry. Good old Harry. The argument had been gone sour last night. Will have gone sour? "Why should we go? We have no idea what this is. No idea!" he had exclaimed, gesturing wildly as he was wont to do.\n\nI inserted the small key into the lock on the doorknob, and sure enough it clicked into place. I turned the knob and stepped inside.\n\nHarry was always the smart one. The prudent one. He had all these rules. "We can't risk collapsing the universe!" or some such theoretical physics bullshit. He'd be hopping mad if he knew I'd actually gone. Well, he doesn't need to know, it's a fucking time machine isn't it? I'll be back before he knows it.\n\nBehind the door was a long and dimly lit corridor. The only sound was the subtle whirring of a large ceiling fan overhead. Well, that and the creaking of the metal door as I shut it back into place.\n\nA desk. There was a desk. And behind it, a person. A stocky woman, her hair tied in a bun, wearing spectacles. She looked up from what looked like a sudoku puzzle as I stepped closer. Did they even have sudoku in 1923? I reached into my pocket for the envelope again.\n\nI needn't have bothered. "Mr. Reyes, isn't it?" She nodded towards the far end of the hallway. "Take the elevator at the end. There's only one stop."\n\n"Er, I was hoping to ask--"\n\n"Pl
