Philippines.\n\nIn the city areas, I think belief in ghosts and the like is comparable to Western countries. It may be more pronounced in the countryside. A lot of people reference local myths of course, but it's not like adults really believe them or anything. There's a lot of old wives tales too but nobody really takes them seriously afaik\n\nThere's a lot of chinese families here who practice feng shui and the like too
