The country's name in the local language is "Pilipinas". The citizens are "Pilipinos"

The national language is called "Filipino" (in English) and "Pilipino" (in Filipino). 

It used to be that the official Filipino alphabet did not include the letter F. This is no longer the case https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filipino_alphabet

Also, in English, the correct adjective to use is "Philippine", i.e. the Philippine population.
