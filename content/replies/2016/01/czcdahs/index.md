I sorted all my commons/uncommons a while back, somewhere between 20-25k cards all in all (a good number from pre-Modern sets). Booster boxes can hold like 2-3 letters at a time, i.e. one booster box is enough for all As, Bs and half of Cs. All the Ss needed more than two booster boxes =/\n\nAlso, I probably need better storage than booster boxes
