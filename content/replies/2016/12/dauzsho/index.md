Yes, you should give it a try.\n\nEven if it crashes and burns, you will have learnt much from the effort, including whether you have it in you to write some more.  Without the attempt, you will never know if the effort would have been worth it. \n\nWhen an idea burns bright in your head and you are unable to set it aside, don't you feel an obligation to follow it down whatever path it leads, no matter how dark it might be?
