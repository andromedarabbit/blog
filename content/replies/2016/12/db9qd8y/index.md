Sige setting aside that "state-sponsored" and "extrajudicial" aren't necessarily the same, that statement above isn't saying the killings are extrajudicial, just that the government should protect all persons from such killings. There are no conclusions there, only a call for the authorities to stay true to their duty.\n\nIt's the same as saying "stay away from drugs", that's a warning, not a conclusion that you're doing drugs.\n\nSo ulit: where did she say they were definitely state-sponsored (o sige, extrajudicial) executions?
