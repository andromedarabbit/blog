You have a voice. You have internet access. At the very least, speak up on social media. Don't be afraid of the trolls. Don't be afraid if your friends or family might get offended. Speaking up might not do anything, or it might do something or it might give other people the courage to speak up as well. If you don't speak up, you do nothing for sure.
