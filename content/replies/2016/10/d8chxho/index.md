I have a friend who's been planning for the worst-case scenarios. Like, he started setting up a will in case something bad happens. And he set up an exit strategy in case we get to North Korea levels of bad (He's a US dual citizen, so it's a bit easier for him)\n\nI'm not that down yet, but it's pretty hard to be optimistic. Many signs point to a creeping authoritarianism that some people are blindly willing to accept. \n\nIt's not even about whether the economy does well or goes poof. Either way is bad. If the economy tanks, we're screwed. If the economy chugs along or does well, then the authoritarian measures can be justified as working
