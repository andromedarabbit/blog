On the rare occasion I have to go to Ortigas (usually in the afternoon/evening), I enjoy taking the P2P from SM North. It's reasonably comfortable, and ang luwag ng bus since against the traffic.\n\nMy only complaint would be that hindi reliable yung timetable nila, the buses don't really leave at the scheduled time
