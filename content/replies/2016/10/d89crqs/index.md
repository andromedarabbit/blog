I initially thought a Force of Will reprint would be good, but it might still be too strong for modern. \n\nI would suggest instead that they print a card that is slightly worse:\n\nLesser Force of Will\n\n2UU Instant\n\nCounter target noncreature spell. ~ can't be countered.\nYou may exile this card and another blue card from your hand and pay 1 life instead of paying ~'s mana cost.\n\nSuch a card would keep combo decks in check (Ad Nauseum, Through the Breach, also anything that kills with Become Immense, etc)
