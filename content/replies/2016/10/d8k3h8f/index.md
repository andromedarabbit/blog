I've tried for nanowrimo before, but couldnt quite muster the discipline to get to the finish, hopefully I make it this time!\n\nI have an idea I've had running around in my head that's a bit ambitious and might be too complicated (think game of thrones-level of plotting and treachery and what-not). I'm wondering if I shouldn't think up something a lot lighter
