It's very valuable because:\n\n- it's very useful since it serves a "flexible" land slot in your deck. Normally it can be either an Island or a Forest. But in older sets there are also lands that are both Island and Plains or Forest and Mountain. Effectively, in formats where the old cards are legal, Misty Rainforest can fetch the correct color mana you need at any time. Because of this flexibility, such lands are used in a lot of decks in those formats where old cards are legal, meaning there is a high demand for them\n\n- the original version is out of print and has had high demand for a long time, driving the price up\n\n- the newer printing from Battle for Zendikar (the one you have) is a very very very rare pull - I'm not sure about the numbers, but someone else here mentioned only 1 in around 200 booster packs will have it\n\nIn short, congratulations on the pull!
