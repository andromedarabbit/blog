This happened to me back in the late 90s. I think I passed even less than 23 units :p Yes, you will be in probation for one sem. I don't remember if I wrote a letter of appeal, but it shouldn't be too hard if you need to, just promise to focus more on your studies and to do better (and you really should! Engg won't give you another chance)

I suggest you talk to your adviser before following any advice from this thread.
