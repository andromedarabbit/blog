150k isn't a lot, it can vanish in an instant if you're not careful. Put your money in a savings account first, you'll need it as a buffer for emergency expenses. You only have a year of college left, prioritize finishing that, then look for a decent job. \n\nTry to track your expenses, don't spend too much on unnecessary things until you have stable income. If you have time, take on some part-time work while finishing your studies.
