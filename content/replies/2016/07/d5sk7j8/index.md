I have a number of doctor friends who post against doctor-shaming, and I never understand why because I never see any doctor-shaming posts in my feeds. I guess I'm just pretty lucky.\n\nDon't be disheartened! Being a doctor is a public service, even if you are "only in it for the money". If you have friends who post such things, either educate them or unfriend them, they are not worth your time
