These are simple questions if you have a solid understanding of how triggers work and stack timings\n\nWhen Cloudshift resolves, both Spell Queller triggers go on the stack at the same time. You get to choose the order they go on the stack. At this time, you must choose targets. The "enters the battlefield" trigger has no valid targets, as the Expedite is still in exile at the time both triggers go on the stack. You get to recast the Expedite when the "Leaves the Battlefield" trigger resolves\n\nMirrorwing Dragon's ability triggers when an instant or sorcery is cast that targets it. The trigger will go on the stack before you even have a chance to cast Spell Queller on the Expedite. Exiling the Expedite does not affect the copies created by the Mirrorwing Dragon trigger. If no other effects, the copies will resolve and you get to draw cards for the copies. You do not draw a card for the original Expedite. If you flicker the Spell Queller, you get to cast Expedite again so yes to the second part
