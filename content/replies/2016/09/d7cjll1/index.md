I'm an experienced (10+ years) programmer considering dabbling in game dev, and I've already started studying Unity. Does anyone know the pros and cons of using Gamemaker over Unity? Also, what are Gamemaker's licensing terms usually, what do I have to do/pay if I want to release a game commercially?
