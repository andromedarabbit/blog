Ang problema kasi may certain camps promoting the thought that "Hey, if you're not for us, you're against us", as if supporting the administration can't include any kind of criticism. Here's a fun example: https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1755650121373433&id=100007853866672\n\nIt seems like the only kind of unity they're interested in is one where people mindlessly follow like sheep and no one is allowed to criticize.
