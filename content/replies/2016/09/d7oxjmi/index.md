The cloud is a backup, not your primary. You don't even have to update it daily (though that's probably better). The idea is that if you lose your work in a fire, you still have something to fall back on instead of nothing at all\n\nBacking up doesn't even require high-speed internet. I only have 4mbps where I live (third-world problems), but I have dropbox autosync on all my devices
