I made a couple of comics today about local politics here in the Philippines. Most of you probably can't relate, although you might have heard about the relevant personalities on world news\n\nPresidential spokesperson: http://imgur.com/FbCrhhJ\n\nTranslation:\n\n- Panel 1: "Let us not say hurtful things and threaten one another"\n- Panel 2: "Is that applicable to the president?"\n- (Panels 1 and 4 are actual statements released by the spokesperson)\n\nSenator Boxer: http://imgur.com/f7k8899\n\nTranslation:\n\n- Panel 1: (interviewing witness) "How can we believe you if you keep changing your statements?"\n- Panel 2: "Ser, didn't you say you would retire from boxing?"\n- Panel 4: "What did you say?" "Er, nothing your honor!"\n
