Worth means something different to every person, so it depends on what definition you use and what priorities you think society should have. There are a number of priorities to choose from: survival, advancement of knowledge, expansion of territory, etc.

If you judge based on a priority of survival, then I guess you would give greater worth to food producers (farmers, etc). If you judge based on advancement, perhaps scientists would be ranked highly. I would also imagine that all other things being equal, younger people would be worth more than older people as they have more potential

Regardless of what priority you choose, a precise measurement of a person's worth or ranking will be very difficult, if not impossible, given all the nuances of human life and the inherent potential that any human life possesses
