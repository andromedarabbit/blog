I uploaded a new version here: https://supermariomakerbookmark.nintendo.net/courses/2585-0000-01F7-0982 if you still want to try it out.\n\nI've tried your level, it's fun and seems to be just the right amount of difficulty, although I had a bit more retries at the last room than I was happy with haha. Cleared and starred!
