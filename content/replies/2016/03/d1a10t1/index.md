What exactly is the endgame of your movement? What are the conditions where you get to say "That's it, we did it guys, quitting time"?\n\nDon't you think NPA activities in the poorest provinces act as a hindrance to business investment and development in those regions? \n\nHow does bombing cell sites and power plants (thus depriving the area of infrastructure) help improve the lives of the people?
