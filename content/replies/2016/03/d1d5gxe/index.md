Dawn of Justice: http://i.imgur.com/GkczQz4.jpg\n\nThis one took me longer than Man of Steel's running time, around two and a half hours (I was sketching while watching in preparation for Batman vs Superman tomorrow). Not sure how terribly slow that is haha (Please tell me so I can know how much I need to improve :p)
