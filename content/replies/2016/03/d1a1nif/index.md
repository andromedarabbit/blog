> After the socialist revolution, which comes after enacting genuine national democracy.\n\nWhat exactly does that mean? No propaganda BS. Like if someone came up to your leadership and said, sige ano yung top 10 action items na kelangan gawin para matapos na ito?\n\n> The business investments themselves are taking advantage of the workforce surplus in an impoverished setting through cheap labor. Papasok diyan yung "at least [insert statement here]. We should not settle for less. As Filipino citizens, we should be entitled to the same rights and opportunities, regardless of socio-economic status.\n\nAgain, what exactly does that mean? What exactly should a business be doing to not be victimized by the NPA? If ako business owner ako, and I want to bring jobs to the people, why should I bother going to regions where there is a strong NPA presence?\n\n> That I don't know. Sa unit ko, walang ganyan. Cliche na pero, each unit in different areas operate independently from one another, so kung majajustify nila yun, sila na yun.\n\nPlease find someone who can answer, that would be great\n
