I have to agree it's a bit too much. The president's presscon early morning Sunday spawned no less than 7 threads I believe. What I suggest would be to have a daily politics megathread, and all politics-related posts outside that thread will be banned. This will require more active moderation though, not sure if the mods have the time (if not, I'm willing to volunteer lol)
