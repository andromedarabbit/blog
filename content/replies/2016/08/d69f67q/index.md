Some minor nitpicks: \n\nI think you could use a comma in the third line: "Your voice, richer than a golder lyre", makes it read a bit better together with the other lines in the same stanza\n\n"And lips, that, like the sun, are ever warm," - one too many commas in this line, I think you could stand to remove either the one before or after "that"
