Do you mean the historical stats? Here is a slide presented by a pro-Duterte senator yesterday: http://imgur.com/s5Fb74q. His chart is poorly presented (since not all the points cover the same amount of time, and the last data point he hasnt explained where he got the numbers from), but the 2010-2014 data should be from the police themselves
