For the record I do live there, and Kim Jong-Il's approval ratings are sky high too :p\n\nThe death toll cited in the guardian article is from police killings and vigilante killings only (does not include other murder/homicide) *and* it's only since July, not for the entire year. For the entire year it will be closer to 11-13k, historically speaking. So we have about the same homicide rate with around a third of the population
