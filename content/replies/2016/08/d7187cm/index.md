I'm referring to the House of M universe where Logan was a shield agent and Magneto was some kind of royalty etc. Obviously the stuff in the first issue where they had Scarlet Witch in Genosha and the resulting consequences of the story arc ("No more mutants") took place in 616, so I didn't bother specifying

Arguably, since it "replaced" 616 for a bit, you might not consider it an alternate reality, but it's as much alternate reality as Age of Apocalypse was. AoA happened the same way - it replaced 616 for a bit until they did the Bishop going into the M'Kraan crystal thing to restore 616, but they later showed AoA universe to continue as an "alternate reality"

In any case, whether you consider it an alternate reality or not, it's definitely not a reboot in any way, shape, or form
