House of M was an alternate reality created by Scarlet Witch, not a reboot. The Marvel Universe has never rebooted. The closest to come was during last year's Secret Wars, which featured the multiverse being destroyed and then rebuilt again at the end. Most elements from previous continuity still exist in the resulting new multiverse (Hyperion, Captain America and Namor explicitly remember the events leading to the prior destruction of the multiverse, for example)
