It's kind of a testament to how poor his management of Davao City actually was that he goes away for 3 years and things go to shit. Good management means things get better regardless of who is in power, which means strengthening institutions. If Davao City goes to shit whenever he's not mayor, what happens to Davao City when he dies?
