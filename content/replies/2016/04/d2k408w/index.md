I'm 37, thanks for saying na bata pa ako.\n\nSo what you're saying is that it takes more than 3 terms to make things better in the long term right? Kung magsalita kasi si Mayor parang isang pitik nya lang maayos na lahat e. In 3-6 months nga mawawala na ang krimen. Pagkahalal nga nya kakausapin nya lang ang senado't kongreso ng kung anong gusto nyang batas, in one week meron na agad\n\n> Madali mag type na dapat ganito at ganyan, pero having worked in LGU ang hirap.\n\nPakisabi na lang yan kay mayor
