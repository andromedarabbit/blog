From the Wikipedia entry: He earned the nickname "Berdugo" ("The Butcher") for his alleged involvement in numerous human rights violations, such as the Murder of Eden Marcellana and Eddie Gumanoy and the Disappearance of Sherlyn Cadapan and Karen Empeno. He was arrested in Manila in 2014 after three years of hiding.
