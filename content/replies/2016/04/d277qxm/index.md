I understand the theory behind it, and will try these things to practice my own meaty setups, but one of my concerns right now when playing ranked (I'm only in Super Bronze so I'm not particularly good) is that against higher-ranked players, I often find myself helpless on waking up because of meaty attacks in particular. So I'm a bit more interested in what one can do when the opponent knows these setups inside and out. Do I just try to predict whether he is going for the meaty and block then punish?
