If you feel like you have too much money, the reasonable options are:\n1. Save it for a rainy day (or invest to make it grow)\n2. Help out someone else in need, especially those who might not have everything during the holday season.

That being said, I wouldn't mind being gifted a copy of Fallout: New Vegas on Steam :D
