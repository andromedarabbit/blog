I love playing sealed, but to be honest if you want to be finishing competitively you pretty much have to try to play perfectly and build your sealed pool perfectly. There are so many things outside your control (sealed pool, pairings, luck of the draw) that you have to maximize the things you do have control over. I usually assume I'm going to lose at least one match to mana screw, so the rest of the games I have to play perfectly since x-2 will usually not top8

It is also easy to look at the players at the top table and just assume they were so lucky with what they got with their sealed pools, but the truth is there are equally as many people with awesome sealed pools who fall to imperfect builds or plays.
