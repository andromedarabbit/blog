Your old cards might still be relevant in Eternal formats called Vintage and Legacy. These are formats that allow cards from any period of MTG, with some exceptions.\n\nDo you prefer playing online or IRL? If you collect cards on Magic Online, they can be "redeemed" in full sets, i.e. if you have one of each card from the set Zendikar on Magic Online, they can be redeemed for one of each Zendikar card IRL. However, redemptions are not always available, it depends on whether they have paper cards in stock to redeem the online cards. I have personally never redeemed MtgO cards.\n\nIf you don't have a lot of resources (i.e., don't have a lot of money) and want to play IRL, I suggest you look for a group of friends that you can play with casually at first. Depending on your experiences with them you may be able to transition into more serious play by borrowing cards, etc.
