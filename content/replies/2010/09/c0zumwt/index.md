It is not like Age of Empires, the gameplay is turn-based instead of real-time, and much more massive scale. \n\nReading through the manual might help you decide whether to buy or not. Or maybe look for videos of Civ 4 gameplay (I remember seeing some introductory videos to Civ 4 on youtube) to get an idea of what a Civ game is like.
