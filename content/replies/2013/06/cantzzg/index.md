I always get physical for 3ds. I buy digital on Steam and PSN and the AppStore, but not on the eShop because Nintendo won't implement the primary advantage digital downloads for me: tying the purchase to an account so that even if something bad happens to my device I can still access the game on a future device. It's doubly important for handhelds!
