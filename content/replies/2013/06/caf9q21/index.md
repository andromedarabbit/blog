> Is there anyway to know what games are upcoming in the U.S. store?\n\nOnly for the coming month, since they announce all of the month's free games on the first week.\n\n>And if I buy a U.S. subscription, and I later buy a Europe one when the U.S. expires, can I still acces my games I bought with the U.S. account?\n\nNope.\n\n>Is it possible to buy a code in stores in the EU and use it on the U.S. store?\n\nThe code you buy would have to specifically be for the US store; ask the clerk at the store you're buying at to give you a US code/card.
