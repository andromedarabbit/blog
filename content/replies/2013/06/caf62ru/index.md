I started up Persona 4: Golden on the Vita. It's mildly addictive, because I keep wanting to maximize what I do everyday. If you haven't played it, it's a weird cross of dungeon crawling with Pokemon-like battles (elemental weaknesses, etc) and Life/Dating Sim (for the noncombat parts); the relationships you build in the noncombat parts improve the Personas (pokemon) you can use in the dungeons, the noncombat stats unlock quests that require you to farm in the dungeons, etc. I think I've played some 20-30 hours since starting it around Tuesday or Wednesday.
