Ohms are a unit of resistance, which tells limits the amount of current that can be generated by a given voltage in a circuit. This means that given the same amount of voltage, a higher resistance will result in a smaller current.\n\nLet's say you have two devices. You know that device A has twice as much resistance (twice as many ohms) as device B. \n\nIf you hook up device A to a five-volt battery, a certain amount of current will flow through (that is, charge will flow through the device at a certain speed). \n\nIf you hook up the same battery to device B, since device B has half the resistance of device A, there will be twice as much current flowing through device B compared to device A. (Electrical charge will be moving twice as fast)
