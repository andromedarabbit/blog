I have both (well technically, I have access to both...the 3DS is my brother's and he doesn't use it.) I've had access to the 3DS longer, the Vita is only a couple of months old.\n\nI use the Vita a lot more because reasons:\n\n1. The screen is very very nice, especially compared to the 3DS screens. My eyes hurt a bit after a while of using the 3DS (even with 3D off). The Vita games also look a lot better compared to 3DS ones.\n\n2. Playstation Plus. Nuff' said.\n\n3. No online account for the 3DS means I'm not going to make digital purchases off the eShop, which limits my available library. I'm worried about losing or breaking the system and losing access to all my purchases. \n\n4. I just find that I like more games on the Vita. I like Mario and Zelda on the 3DS (the new Legend of Zelda will probably be the next game I play on 3DS), but aside from that most of the library is meh for me. I played Tales of the Abyss and Paper Mario Sticker Star on the 3ds but both got boring for me quickly. I might try out Fire Emblem, and if there's a new Advance Wars I'd jump on that. On the Vita, I've been playing P4G, Disgaea 3, Gravity Rush and I want to go through SFxT and Blazblue:CS, then there's Uncharted, Final Fantasy Tactics and I heard Zero Escape was good, and I want to try Guacamelee, and one of these days I'm going to give in to impulse buying urges and get Xenogears off the store, oh and if LBP vita went on sale I'd get that, etc. \n\n5. Achievements/Trophies. I realize a lot of people don't care for them and don't "get" people who like them and that's fine, more power to you. But I do like them, though I'm not like a platinum hunter or anything like that.
