> For instance, there doesn't appear to be a post on there about uncharted or xcom being free at the moment. \n\nThey have a weekly PS store update post which includes the PS+ IGC games for that week, Uncharted 3 and X-Com are covered here: http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/11/playstation-store-update-295/\n\nEdit: Also http://blog.us.playstation.com/2013/06/10/playstation-plus-e3-2013-sale-free-machinarium-uncharted-3-xcom-more/\n\n> Also, there is a lot of other crap on there.\n\nThat's only because it's E3 this week. \n\n> Was hoping there might be a PS+ specific feed somewhere.\n\nDon't know about that, but since the blog is an official source, literally every PS+ free game and sale gets announced there at some point. Between reddit (r/PlaystationPlus) and the blog, I don't see any chance of "missing out" on any deals.\n\nEdit: I only thought to try this after writing this post, but you can just subscribe to their PS+ tag directly to get the PS+ content only.
