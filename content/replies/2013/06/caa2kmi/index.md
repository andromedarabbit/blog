It would have to be enough life to stave off death from aggro attacks for 2-3 turns because (a) you wasted a turn casting it and (b) you still need to naturally draw into whatever answer you're looking for within the window the life gain gives you.\n\nI'd say 12 might be borderline playable, depending on the environment. 15 is already reasonable and will probably see sideboard play. 20 seems a bit overboard, but it could be balanced if aggro becomes really strong/fast
