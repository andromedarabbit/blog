The console features weren't very exciting so if they had something new there that might have helped. Although TBH the hardware spec bump is pretty significant already, I don't mind this so much.\n\nMore exclusives would have been nice, although I have to say Second Son is looking pretty sweet. I don't actually care for the XBox "exclusives" myself, but the longer list of titles on that side makes it easier for XBox fans to talk themselves out of switching.\n\nAnd Vita owners everywhere will say: more Vita support, more Vita games, Vita/memory card price drops. The Vita is a clear differentiator over MS (and even Nintendo - the Vita and the 3ds dont actually occupy the exact same market niche in terms of games) so more PS4 x Vita features would have been great too.\n\nRight now, they clearly won over MS, but that's only because MS made so many blunders along the way. If all of the above had been provided, xb1 might have been buried so hard whoever manages to pull it out of that hole would be named king of england.
