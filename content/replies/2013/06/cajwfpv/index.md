They're not going to change anything this early in the game, when the consoles aren't even out, for the same reason that the die-hard XBox fans are still going to buy the machine on launch, even if they're a minority now - it's still too early to tell what's going to happen, and Sony still has a lot of chances to screw things up. Sony may have won E3, but that was just E3, the real test is where we are 2 years down the road.
