If the Xbox One (a) lets me play all my PS3 discs and PSN downloads AND (b) had an online service that gave out lots of value in free games, that'd turn me for sure. I'm not terrible interested in Xbox franchises like Halo or Gears of War. (I originally typed GoW, but realized that means God of War)

PS4 has (b) but not (a), but I'm not rushing out to get that on release date either, and I figure given enough time and Gaikai, Sony would be able to figure something out for (a)
