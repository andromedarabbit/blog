I'm in the process of going through all the cards now. My current scheme is 3 groups: rares/mythics (sorted alphabetically), commons/uncommons (sorted alphabetically), excess trash commons/uncommons. \n\nI still keep trash cards, but no more than 1 playset. (This part might be a bit irrational), the rest go into the 3rd group\n\nI'm only at letter C at the moment, but I've already filled up more than one booster box of trash cards, I'll dispose of them somehow once I'm done with everything. Aside from the excess trash, I have roughly one booster box each of A, B and C, and one fat pack of A,B,C rares/mythics sorted. \n\nI already have all the other cards sorted by letter, I just need to go through them to classify and group each bucket. I started around 3 weeks ago and just sort/organize a few stacks of cards at a time. The cards are currently stored in numerous booster boxes, fat packs and such; I'll think about better storage when I'm done with all this sorting.\n\nI also separate all the foils, regardless of rarity. I have about 2/3rds of a booster box worth of foils, not yet sure what to do with them. Maybe I'll make some sort of weird unbalanced cube.\n\nHere's a picture of some cancels: http://i.imgur.com/yuyzcM5.jpg
