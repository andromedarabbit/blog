I don't really care about the UI, but they really need to do something about server stability, lag and recovery from crashes.\n\nMTGO's convenience is a big plus for me, since I can't really allocate any large amount of time towards paper Magic anymore (and most of the people I grew up playing Magic with have moved to faraway places). The server issues are the only real problem and the reason why I dont play large events any more.
