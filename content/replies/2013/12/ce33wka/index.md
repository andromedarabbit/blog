Are you employed? Many employers will provide health insurance. If your employer doesn't you might want to find one that does. \n\nYou can also apply to Philhealth even if you're not employed (you'll have to make contributions manually)\n\nYou should also be able to apply with private insurance groups for personal coverage (again, you'll have to make the contributions yourself). The only ones I've tried are Intellicare and Medocare.\n\nIt is bad not to have health insurance if you are accident prone, or your family has a history of hereditary illnesses, or you are growing older (in your 30s maybe, but I would recommend getting health insurance as soon as possible)\n\nEven if it's not something serious like cancer or a stroke, diagnostic procedures can cost as much as 10k-30k or more, so having insurance to cover some or all of that definitely helps.
