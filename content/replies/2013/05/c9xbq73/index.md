There's more info from the article:\n\n- Special Edition Release including the base game and exciting mix of additional content (Steam only)\n\n- Loyalty Offer for players who previously purchased Magic 2013 (Steam and Xbox only) (woohoo~)\n\n- Liliana’s Reaver, Garruk’s Horde, Chandra’s Phoenix, Jace’s Mindseeker, and Ajani’s Chosen will be the foil face cards for the M14 intro packs\n\n
