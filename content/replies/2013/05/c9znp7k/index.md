Physical purchases (vita cartridges/ps3 discs) are not region locked, you can play games you bought from any physical store anywhere.

For PS+, you'll need a Sony Entertainment Network (SEN) account. Your account will have a country associated with it at creation time and this cannot be changed later.

Online purchases made through the PSN store are tied to your SEN account and the Vita can only have one account active. If you will be in Canada long-term, I suggest that you get a North American PS+ code with your Vita and create a North American (Canada or US) account. However, I don't know if the NA Plus offerings are better than whatever Australian accounts get.

Additionally, I think the PSN stores will only accept credit cards from the same region (this is true for the US store), so it if you plan to make online purchases, take this into account.

DLC for some games is region-locked. For example: a region 1 (North America) copy of Street Fighter x Tekken will only work with DLC downloaded/purchased from a US or Canada PSN store.
