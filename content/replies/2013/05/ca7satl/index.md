1. "unmanipulated open market" is exactly why MM is expensive - demand is high and buyers are willing to pay at a high price and sellers are free to sell at the price (because the market is "unmanipulated" and "open")

2. How would you feel if you ripped a Voice of Resurgence from a booster pack and Wizards told you that you could only sell it for $5 or trade for another card with the same rarity 1:1?

3. Even if there was some magical way to force retailers to sell product at MSRP, buyers will just turn around and sell them at expensive prices because that's what the market is willing to pay. Again, supply and demand.

4. Not everyone has a DCI#!
