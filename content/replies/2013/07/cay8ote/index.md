So, I purchased it on GMG before watching the review, might have been a good idea to do it in the reverse order. I still would have purchased it anyway. \n\nAnyway, I found out from the review that this is the last expansion for civ 5? I'm kind of disappointed because I was hoping they would implement a "random events" system like what they had in the last civ4 expansion. Still probably gonna spend a couple of hundred hours here though :p
