I'm 30+ years old, and I play my 3ds or Vita everywhere, on the commute, when in line for anything, while waiting at a restaurant, etc. I don't really care what other people think. :p\n\nBest story, during one of my commutes I was riding in a shuttle type thing with people sitting on every side of me and I had my DS (this was maybe half a decade ago) playing this tower defense game Ninja Town and I was in a dire situation and had to activate this power which required me to blow into the DS to activate it. To the uninitiated it must have looked really weird, but what the hell, I went ahead and blew as hard as I could into the DS that day. No fucks were given, lol
