Mutavault is very hard to kill with Supreme Verdict or any other sorcery-speed effects.\n\nDoes not use up a creature slot in your deck, but still gives you a potential win condition.\n\nYou choose when it is a creature, so you can use that timing to your advantage. i.e. wipe the board of creatures, then activate your manland to attack.
