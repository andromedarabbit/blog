You don't have to. If you want, I'll just give you a summary right here.\n\n[Spoiler](#s "US Govt forms their own Justice League (JLA) to keep JL in check. Later Superman somehow loses control and accidentally kills one of the JLA members, Dr Light. The three Justice Leagues (JL, JLA and JL Dark - the magic guys) start hunting for this magic thing called Pandora's Box which they think can cure Superman or something, but the box radiates evil and makes them all fight one another. The leader of the Secret Society, the Outsider, makes an appearance and reveals that the box is actually a device that can open a gateway to his parallel world Earth-3. Then he uses the box to bring the Crime Syndicate of America (you might want to research them) over to our world. It is revealed that the Outsider is actually the "Alfred" of Earth-3 and the female Atom of the JL is actually from Earth-3 and was the one who jabbed a sliver of Kryptonite into Superman's brain to make him kill Dr Light, and that Cyborg's mech parts were actually an evil robot called Grid. Trinity War ends with the Crime Syndicate claiming this world as theirs ")\n\nIf you really want to read it, reading the first (Justice League 22) and last (Justice League 23) issues are sufficient. All the rest is filler. And really, the only thing you need to know is that [Spoiler](#s "there's an evil Justice League that wants to take over this world")
