I dunno. It felt a bit out of place. I mean, Mike's being a bit irrational, pushing all his frustrations on Coulson as a handy representative of the government. And some of his thoughts kind of came out of nowhere (like the part about gods), he wasn't really showing any serious existentialist thinking like this during the earlier parts.
