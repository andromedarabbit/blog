It might be overheating. Get a program to monitor CPU temp (try CPU-Z) and the graphics card temp (try gputemp). See if you can set them to warn when the temp reaches a certain value. \n\nIf you find that it's really overheating, you might have to scale down the settings to avoid it, or maybe clean out your CPU case or invest in more heat sinks.
