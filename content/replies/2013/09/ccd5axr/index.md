I think he'll come back reincarnated as a bear, and he has to somehow convince the Avengers that he's Peter Parker using only grunts and bear swipes, but then he also has this weird need to always have honey.  Then Iron Man builds him some bear armor he uses to take down Superior Spider-Man so that he can fashion a body exchange device to get back into his old body.

After the body swap, the bear gets into an accident that fuses octopus arms to his body. A live octopus, not a mechanical one.
