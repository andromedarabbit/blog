Yes, they are linear, as long as they take place in the same continuity. For example, DC currently has 52 ongoing series that all take place in the same continuity, all of these stories are canon. (Although some of them may take place in different universes, like Earth-2; but those stories are still canon since Earth-2 interacts with other universes so continuity exists between them too)\n\nOften a publisher will have a number of books that are "out of continuity", these stories are unrelated to their main continuity and will mostly be stand alone. Current examples for DC are "Batman 66" (it's the Adam West Batman!), "Smallville Season Nine" (which follows the continuity of the TV series)\n\nBecause it's possible for different universes to interact (i.e. characters crossing over), even those with separate continuity may interact with the main ones.
