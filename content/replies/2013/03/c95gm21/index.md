> So how is this at all different from one person buying the game and letting someone else have their cross-buy version\n\nDid the place it was rented from say the first renter could have the cross buy version? If not, then it's seems closer to one person buying it and the second person borrowing the game under the pretext of playing it then using the cross-buy version without permission. The one who bought the game is the one entitled to get the cross-buy version, and unless he explicitly let you have it then you're taking advantage of his ignorance.
