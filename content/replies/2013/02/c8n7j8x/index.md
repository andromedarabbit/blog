It's fine, just keep going through the levels until you get the hang of it. If you're missing 1/10 attacks it just means you're trying to attack an enemy whose SPD is too high for your hit. If some of your characters are consistently unable to hit, try giving them equipment that boosts their HIT.\n\nYour lower level guys are going to have trouble hitting/damaging higher level guys, use them in combos with your higher level guys so that they can gain some EXP from kills. (Put them side-by-side or right behind the higher level guy who will do the attack and there's a chance for a combo)
