#6 is part of the Omega Effect crossover with the Daredevil and Punisher books\n\n#8 is an epilogue for the Ends of the Earth storyline from Amazing Spider-man\n\nThey are probably not included in Vol 2 because they are included with separate volumes for their own storylines. \n\nIt should be fine to miss them, but you might also be interested in reading the above two storylines.
