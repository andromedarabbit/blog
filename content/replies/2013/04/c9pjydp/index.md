Most books are released on a monthly basis, but they don't all come out on the same week, so usually a different set of books comes out every week.

For Marvel, some of their books double-ship, meaning they come out twice a month (sometimes more). I think DC is fairly regular with their monthly schedule. You can check the links in the OP for a list of what books are expected to come out this week and most of those sites will have schedules for the next few weeks/months as well.
