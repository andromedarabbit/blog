> it wasn't long ago that I was putting roads/railroads on every tile possible rather than just linking cities\n\nI remember doing this back in Civ1, because roads/rails gave tiles a trade bonus and there was no maintenance penalty for having too many roads. At that time too, rails cost ZERO movement points, which meant railing my entire continent = units instantly move from one end to the other at will. Good times lol
