It's a problem of balance. If the RPG isn't well-balanced, it may punish the player for decisions made early on (i.e. he chose an ability that didn't turn out to be as useful as he expected), and having no respec option at all locks him into that choice. I agree that there needs to be some level of consequence to your choices and we can't expect the game to be balanced 100% with regards to character choices, but the problem is that for a new player playing a new game, he will almost invariably be unable to judge correctly whether certain choices are good or bad.\n\nSo my answer is: I'd prefer not having respec options, but I understand the need for them. Maybe not have respeccing be so easy or something would be a good idea (i.e. need to complete some quest that gets harder every time you want to respec)
