Are you asking about the concept of comic book universes in general or about what universes Marvel has specifically?

Marvel has an infinite number of universes (all of them together comprise the Marvel multiverse), as opposed to DC which has only 52 universes. Each universe is usually identified by a number.

The main Marvel universe in which most of the Marvel comic book stories have taken place is commonly referred to as the 616 universe.

The other universes most active right now are the Ultimate universe for the Ultimate Comics line (I forgot the exact designation for this universe, it's 16xx I think) and the Marvel Cinematic Universe (I believe this is designated universe 199999) for the Iron Man/Avengers set of movies.
