So far it's been 5 issues of "hey let's split up into 3 different groups that don't make sense and go to random places together and occasionally hit each other". It feels like everything significant is going to happen in the sixth issue.

I feel like this could have been done in a single 3-issue crossover between the 3 books, instead of dragging it out over six.
