Thanks for indulging us. May I ask (pasensya na, medyo madami, thanks in advance if you choose to respond!):

&#x200B;

\- how do you feel about the way the admin is handling our relationship with China? 

\- how do you feel about the alliances with known or perceived corrupt politicos/families like the Marcoses or GMA?

\- how do you feel about the way the president plays fast and loose with the facts, pulls out allegations out of nowhere without explanation, attacks the press, the church, etc

\- how do you feel about the death of Kian? do you think such abuses by the cops are common or rare?

\- " I hope a REAL opposition will be formed in the senate roster for check and balance. Not the 8D type of opposition. " What does this mean? What makes 8D not "REAL opposition"?

\- you mentioned opposing corruption, what about his appointees who had stolen from the public and have never been punished, like the Tulfos? I am not aware of any significant anticorruption successes by this administration (which means prosecution, cases filed etc), forgive my ignorance. I know he has removed some officials for corruption, but have they been prosecuted?

&#x200B;

\- In spite of all the negatives you mentioned, you still feel like this admin is a net positive?

&#x200B;

\- My top 3 issues with Duterte are: (a) encouragement of a culture of violence; and (b) support for GMA and the Marcoses; (c) apparent willingness to submit to the Chinese govt. For me the vast number of killings (including those done by vigilantes and those of cops trying to fill quotas, imagined or otherwise, and those of innocents) is completely unacceptable. Is there something you can tell me to convince me to support him?

&#x200B;

\- Have there been instances that made you doubt your support for the administration? 

&#x200B;

\- What would be a dealbreaker for you, i.e. something this administration would do that would end your support? In my opinion, the president has personally expressed support and/or
