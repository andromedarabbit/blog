I'm happy there's an oldschool Grixis Shadow list there because I haven't played Modern for a while and that's the last deck I had and I was looking at MC Barcelona and I didn't recognize the landscape at all and no more Grixis Shadows. IDK if I want to spend on the Knight-Captains right now to transition to Esper or Mardu. If I take my old Grixis Shadow list to a local modern tourney, how bad are the matchups with the current meta decks?
