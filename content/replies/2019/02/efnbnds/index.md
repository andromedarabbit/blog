    If I activate it in a city, then that city completes an Industrial District bordering
    another civ, it flips those tiles over to me? (It seems weird to do it this way
    instead of just activating over an existing Industrial District to flip adjacent
    tiles)' on /r/civ

In that case, what effect does ability have in the city he was activated in? I initially assumed it was a global effect like you mentioned but then there was a second activation available so I got confused
