GDS is an grindy, interactive deck that requires a lot of Modern matchup knowledge (so you know what to thoughtseize, what hands are safe, when to push your life total, how to sequence your fetches and land drops, etc), I wouldn't have recommended it as a first time Modern deck. You will probably be playing suboptimally until you have quite a few competitive matches under your belt.

On the upside, the deck has been around for a while, so it's well understood - meaning there's a ton of resources available for it. One I read recently was [https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/grixis-deaths-shadow-guide-first-place-at-grand-prix-toronto/](https://www.channelfireball.com/articles/grixis-deaths-shadow-guide-first-place-at-grand-prix-toronto/)
