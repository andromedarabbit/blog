#### Posted on r/civ: [How does Mimar Sinan's activated ability work? If I activate it in a city, then that city completes an Industrial District bordering another civ, it flips those tiles over to me? (It seems weird to do it this way instead of just activating over an existing Industrial District to flip adjacent tiles)](https://reddit.com/r/civ/comments/ammpn5/how_does_mimar_sinans_activated_ability_work_if_i/)
