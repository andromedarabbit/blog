I only have this once a yearCongrats [Paul Villangca](https://www.facebook.com/100000107861748) and Anna Lynn! Nice socks paul :pHappy father's day Kerwin!Ok lang sana kung 1996 pa ito haha, pero hindi eh. These hands aren't used to too much handwriting any more. After six pages of forms, ampanget na ng sulat.

It's annoying lang kasi when building systems for other governments, they make a big deal about not requiring the user to reinput the same data over and over, even if digital form na sya. Dito sa tin, I had to write down my address six times, and my name like twenty times. Buti na lang hindi Juan Carlo Schtoltenheim Reinbach Katigbak III ang pangalan ko.

This was sa comelec, we were applying for transfer of address for voter registration (since naka-register pa kami sa old neighborhood forever). May forms sa comelec website, so okay, dinownload namin yung forms and finill up namin sa bahay, then my mom took the forms to the comelec office at city hall. Hindi daw pwede, dapat daw yung form nila mismo dun ang gamitin and dun dapat i-fill-up in person. (ಠ_ಠ) So bakit pa may forms sa website? Lol

After spending unnecessary time filling in the forms again today, pagbigay sa guy for biometrics, tinype din nya yung mga details into some program. (ಠ_ಠ)When I'm at Pepper Lunch I always use the sauce that's shaped like a dalekTumutulo ang bubong!Some pickups/birthday stuffI was annoyed at things so I randomly decided to have a heavy/expensive dinnerRoy's YearApril to MayJuneA little girl came by bearing giftsJuly to AugustPlaying with the 3ds cameraOctober 29I needed a cradle to mount my phone on while watching episodes.
