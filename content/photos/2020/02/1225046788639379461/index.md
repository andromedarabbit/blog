was there a recent windows 10 update which broke the search functionality? the taskbar search doesn't work for me now, I have to scroll up and down the start menu like an animal

Removing Bing integration like some replies suggested has worked! (Needs a reboot)

looks like it was a server side issue, [@WindowsUpdate](https://twitter.com/WindowsUpdate/) is looking into it ?s=21
