Swing with the team.1. You Win  OR  2. He Condemns Angel, you gain 8 life. You are at 3. He MUST block with the three critters (unless giant growth) to not die. 4/5 tree becomes unanimated again. Play the Stormfront Pegasus. If he swings with the team, sac the boar to gain 4, leaving you at 7, then chump the largest flier. You are at 1 life with one more turn.but that's a LOT of speculation! ðŸ˜€
