What actually happened was that I wish I never thought of Condemn. If I had swung I would have won, but as it is I forgot that the 4/5 tree would become unanimated and counted the counterattack as lethal so I didn't push and later lost to Plummet.Misplay on my part obviously, if I had done the math correctly and figured I'd be alive at 1, then swinging with the team would definitely have been correct!
