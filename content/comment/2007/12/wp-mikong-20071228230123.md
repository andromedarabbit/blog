You're probably too much of a packrat. And you don't need to compare yourself  to people you know. What's important is if you need those videos, and from  what you said I'm guessing you don't. Don't backup those videos unless they're  very rare or your favorite of all time.There are a couple people I know who back everything up, and sometimes I  borrow from them. A lot of other people borrow from them too. I think we only  need a few them. If you're not the go-to-guy for these things, don't backup.You might even find it refreshing if you throw all those CD's away. Sometimes  it's good not to have these attachments.
