That's probably a good idea, but not really something that's an option with  the company I'm in. You know the deal -- I'd need all sorts of authorizations  to be able to subcontract someone, it's not worth it, especially for a simple  task that would take me an hour or two to figure out.Besides, the post isn't really about how to get things done, but rather the  value of technical problem-solving skill to a software developer, and my own  usual approaches to it.I wrote this because I was doing performance assessments on several junior  developers and noticed that some really had no idea how to go about solving  such issues.
