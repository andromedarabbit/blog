i agree.it's kind of like x-men 3 where the sequel did not disappoint and was more  intent in tying up loose ends. the people i watched it with said *spoiler  alert* venom should've been harder to get rid of/stronger as a villain. after  he becomes venom, i sorta lost the topher grace= eric foreman thing. gotta  love those teeth.
