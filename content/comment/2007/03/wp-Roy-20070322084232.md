Nah, I found it really it was bad memory. (The mem test that came with Ubuntu  really helped)I removed one of the 256MB pieces and Ubuntu works fine now (although I now  have only 256MB of memory left). Windows XP cannot boot at all, I guess one of  the files really did become corrupted. So I'm now a 100% linux user (at least  for the PC in my room)
