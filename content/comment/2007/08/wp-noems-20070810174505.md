hey! nasa hongkong ka pa ba? if you're not after the parks and the shopping  (specifically for clothes) edi go shopping for toys! ðŸ™‚hanap ka nung dyecast (tama ba?) initial D na cars or transformers! or, kung  ayaw mo bumili for you...  bili ka for me at babayaran na lang kita. hehehewent to HK last year 3 days work, another 2 days for leisure. i spent one  whole day in disneyland and 1 whole day in Ocean Park. bad trip lang cause it  was summer time, kaya grabe ang init sa park. ang hindi namin na visit, ung  mga toy stores. ðŸ™‚
