Dunno, maybe not. But that's what I was thinking at that instant. Right now,  they say it was a gas leak, and I find I don't particularly care. Also, there  was an explosion at the Batasan and I think people shrug that off even more  than the one at G2.We're all getting so desensitized to this sort of stuff.
