As an additional note, it's not even limited to work-related stuff. I think  this way even for stuff \*outside\* of work.At any one time I have several personal projects I want to push through with,  a lot of stuff I want to try, stuff I want to read, etc.Now that I think about, the way I handle the work stuff is a lot better than  how I handle the non-work stuff. I guess what want out of all of this is a  better way to organize my own thinking =p
