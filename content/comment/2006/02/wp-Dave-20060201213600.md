Ei Roy,While it's kewl that you can handle the stress of fielding all those "help me"  calls, that's not a healthy company practice... Well, it's certainly got good and bad going for it. It's good because everyone  realizes how utterly indispensable you are, so you'll never be fired. Other  stuff too.I think tho' that there's more bad than good in it...  There's the stress,  which is one thing. And there's also the probability that this role you have  assumed will make the bosses pass you over for promotions because you'll be  considered too valuable where you are for doing stuff that's not formally  yours to do (unless it's really part of your job description to be techno fire  fighter).Anyway, nothing, just wasting time after being flabbergasted by C. Bolastig's  forward to the list.Something you might want to do eventually is to formalize the firefighting  thing by having people do it through a standard procedure instead of actively  pinging your person with stuff. Like, maybe if someone has a problem they  can't work through on their own, they should have to fill out a template  e-mail form about it to send to you so you can quickly go over it or  something. I'm sure \*somebody\* in some Japanese company has a well structured  process for doing this kind of technical advising instead of you having to go  through many that you have to gut it out =PI mean, you can manage the load now, but if your company ever expands...
