Sir Alix wasn't particularly one of my favorite math teachers, but then again  i wasn't as able in math as you were (think borderline bubing). My first  comment when I heard about his passing was "manginginom pala si sir". It turns  out he took the chosen few out for drinks sometimes. And this was true for the  many batches of Pisay people he taught. It must be something to leave such a  legacy &#8212; not the drinking of course, but all that algebra/pre-calculus.ang haba na nito pero may tanong pa ako &#8212; sino si entertainment capital?
