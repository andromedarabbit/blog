Hey, Peng, (or is it still Sushie?). It's me, "Entertainment Capital". Since  my account's on LJ, Roy and I anonymously comment in each other's blogs.In the year that Sir Alix was my boss, he was, as far as I could tell,  completely sober all of the time I was around. He convinced me that Pisay  should destructure the calculus curriculum and to trickle it down the lower  years, as he was teaching it partly in third year, though not as extreme as my  urging to find a way to lower the function analysis parts of it (pertinent for  lab reports) somehow to second (or first!) year. (He fully supported my move  to teach bridge in Math 7 for the second semester, by the by.)His cirrhosis was probably due to earlier bouts of heavy drinking. From what I  hear, his drinking buddies were the heavy drinkers in campus. The year after I  left, he started having fainting spells. Prior even to that, he has had bouts  of high blood pressure, though that could be as likely caused by teaching  stress as by liver problems, I have heard.
