it's when people pass on that you realize how sayang the opportunity was to  really get to know them. when Sir Alix was my teacher, (or any math teacher,  kasi nga i didn't and still don't like math) all i remember was looking at my  watch waiting for free cut to occur. Pero si sir nagbibigay ng leakage, sorta  like near the exams biglang buhos ng math (that i still did not get, btw)  tapos lalabas pala yon sa exam. That's the extent of my memory. Kakainggit  lang siguro yung mga students who were actually friends with him.it's peng now, and not sushie. at mike, pwede ba kita i-link?
