If you want to test bulk, my suggestion would be PVPonline. Mario would  suggest Sluggy Freelance.Technically, it does, since most webcomics come with the standard do-not-  distribute clause. However, most will not stop personal copies. Not a good  idea to spread the word to the public, though, to be on the safe side.
