<p>Problems with the keyboard are a bit overblown esp with the 2018 MBP refresh. Only the 2016 models have actual defective (easier to break) keys. It's really more about personal preference at this point. I love the new keyboard switches they have on the mac, and now the 2015 and below models feel mushy in comparison. But before I decided to buy I went to the store to try out the keyboard myself for a few times if I liked it or not.</p>
