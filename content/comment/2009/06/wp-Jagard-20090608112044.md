He rules that I'm correct that I'm getting <b>2 extra combat steps</b>, and my opponent scoops. I later found out that while the ruling was correct, there was some missing information. Reading the card carefully, you'd see that while I would get 2 additional combat steps, I would only get to untap the Rhox War Monk during the first combat step!&#8212;- I play Finest Hour too. However, I'm unsure about the judge's ruling about this. The same situation happened to me last Friday. However, the judge ruled that we only get 1 extra combat step considering that "it's the first combat phase of the turn" as stated on the card. Oh well, off to the forums and FAQ's for me...
