why dress professionally -- to look professional since we do carry the company's name and image.why have dress down days -- because it's weekend and most likely, people may want to have after work activities that formal clothing will not be appropriate for, and having to carry a 2nd set of clothes is such hassle.why have dress down day when the elevators broke down -- hell no idea. =D
