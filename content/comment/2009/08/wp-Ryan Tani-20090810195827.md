Inspiring. I'm in a similar emo mode right now as my 27th birthday approaches. I, too, am nowhere near reaching my dreams, but I guess that's as it should be. We all forget that where we are now used to be a dream; we just make up new ones all the time. Anyway belated happy birthday! I'm sure you will be insanely successful one day, as people who have the initials RT always do ðŸ˜‰
