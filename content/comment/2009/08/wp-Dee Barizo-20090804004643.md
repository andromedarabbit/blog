Congrats on the win ðŸ™‚I thought about how I would build your sealed deck before I looked at your actual build. My build was very close to yours -- just off by two cards. I would've gone -1 Assassinate, -1 Runeclaw Bear, +1 Rampant Growth, and +1 Divine Verdict. I like going with consistency over power especially if my deck is already pretty good.Also, in your draft, I'm surprised you didn't play Armorer Ascension, Gorgon Flail, and Magebane Armor. Those three cards seem better that Cancel, Negate, and Whispersilk Cloak.Anyways, good luck at the Grand Prix!
