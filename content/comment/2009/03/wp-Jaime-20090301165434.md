Wow, long time since I've played magic myself. Good thing you can keep up with the card upkeeps. And I guess just a bit more practice?Also, Re: "I'm pretty sure giving it flying would make it an invalid target, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong", I think you're right, since the card states "deals 3 damage to target creature with/without flying" versus "Target a flying/non-flying creature, and Branching Bolt deals 3 damage to it."
