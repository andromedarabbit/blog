i know what you mean. i sometimes spend the whole saturdays playing, only  stopping to nibble when i get faint of hunger. it's addicting to control your  destiny. i think that's why i keep playing. you get more control over your  life online as a character (and if you should f--k up, it only takes a few  secs to respawn).
