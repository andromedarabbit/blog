i loved the transformers! my brother had optimus prime and we used it as my  barbie's mode of transport. pero i stopped watching the cartoons when it got  so complicated and there were lots of groups within the autobots and  decepticons. nalipat kami sa voltron and voltes v.\*sings\* the transformers.. more than meets the eye.. autobot (something  something to) fight the evil forces of the decepticons...
