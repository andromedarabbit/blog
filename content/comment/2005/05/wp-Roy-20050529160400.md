I didn't really mean it that way... I was thinking more like "born from a Sith,  trained by Jedi"If you think about it, Luke was able to beat Vader in Return of the Jedi  because of his hate and anger, but he didn't let it control him enough to kill  his father. I guess I always thought it meant he could use the strength of the  dark side without falling to its corruption.
