Darn it...  I haven't solved it yet. Must give it time. I think that I might be  thinking too hard. Then again, I am not so good at puzzles. It takes me a  while to figure them out.A fine example is the puzzle boxes, aka himitsu bako, that Sacha Chua brought  to the talk the other day. It took me a while to figure out this certain box.  Gyaaah! At least the other one I stumbled upon the solution \*laugh\*
