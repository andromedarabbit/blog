Gosh! This brings back grad rites memories.And the memory that I almost did not graduate from Pisay :|I miss Vlad. He was one of the best teachers, ever! He was crazy but not too  crazy. He was mean when it came to exams. But that was ok. He still rocked!I haven't done anything earth-shaking yet. Well, there was Digital Pinay -- I  was one of the bloggers who had so much to say about it but that was about it.  \*laughs\* Feeling ko tuloy wala akong nagawa!
