I give up. Who has won a palanca award?Hey Clair, the Digital Pinay thing was neat. Don't knock the power given by  your ability to speak out on such things. Granted, the Digital Pinay thing was  not much compared to the myriad troubles our country faces on a day-to-day  basis, but it's a small step that shows how modern-day technology empowers  simple individuals like you and me and allows us to affect the issues in our  own small way. I wish I had an issue I could fight! =p
