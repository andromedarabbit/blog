Not that people really bothered to look at my  blog a lot but the word did spread.Ah well. :) That is my being rash. At least something good came out of it ^_-Have you read Sean's blog? hehehe. Prizes up for grabs ;) Aside from the fun  of solcing the puzzle!And when are you and Lorenz going to post a tanaga or two? ;)
