Ubuntu doesn't have a simple Paint app installed but you might want to check  out Gimp. It's a mere 16+MB download. But you don't have to draw it coz I also  imagined it the same way when I was a kid so I'm thinking that's how a lot of  kids might imagine it before it's explained in school. Though I thought the  lower half of the sphere is the ocean where the earth floats (that's why it  ends up in the middle or the plane near the equator as you describe it).ðŸ™‚
