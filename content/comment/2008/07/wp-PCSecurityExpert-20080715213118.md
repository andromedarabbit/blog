I think OEM vendors have some kind of agreement with McAfee and Norton which  forces them to install these antiviruses -- no matter how bad performing they  are. If I'm more or less tolerant with McAfee, then Norton is a system killer.  I've just come across a report where it's said that Norton slows start-up by  50%. Awful! Avast antivirus is much less resource-hungry.
