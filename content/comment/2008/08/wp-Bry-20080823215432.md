Problem is, we've been making too much noise recently that it's possible that  people would dismiss this as yet another random rabble. XP We have to get the  timing right...  and possibly gather surveys or statistics or whatever first to  drive points home.(Posting about this stuff externally has a different impact -- it hints that  there's already a small group of people initiating changes inside a company  wherein changes were traditionally dictated only by the core group. Hehehe...   )
