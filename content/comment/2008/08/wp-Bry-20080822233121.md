Uptake of new technology is pretty much limited by business considerations,  but it's still no excuse to limit expanding developers' horizons.  Unfortunately the current trend of us moving towards generalization of skills  over specialization pretty much screws up the progress department -- we end up  with engineers who have a broad range of outdated unpolished skills than  engineers with less, but more honed, skills.Coding day-in-day-out also tends to give a false sense of "experience". As  I've said to Keis a couple of times already, "There's a difference between 10  years of experience and 1 year of experience ten times over". Even looking at  my own code a year ago makes me facepalm at how little effort we spend in  making sure that our "tools"/"saws" are sharp.
