I guess it depends on the particular set of rules that people know. I didn't  even remember how the game could handle 10 or more people until playing it  again.Besides, blinking can happen involuntarily. Healing cannot. And making the  doctor blink means the Policeman can make a mistake and catch the Doctor!
