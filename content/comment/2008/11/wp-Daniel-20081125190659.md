I think you should cut white. You already have a lot of removal so you don't  really need to play Oblivion Ring since it just makes you have to play a  fourth basic land type. Plus you left out some really good on-color stuff for  those white removal spells, like Topan Ascetic, and less so but still solid  2nd Carrion Thrash and Resounding Roar. You could cut one or two of the gold  2-drops since it seems like (haven't layed out the deck myself) you're pretty  spread among BRG, and you have a decent amount of removal to deal with a rush.You can always board it in if you think you're playing a deck you absolutely  can't beat without it.And Manaplasm is really freaking good, he starts every time you are in Green.
