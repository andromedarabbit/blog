I always get so greedy with removal. If I had a Bone Splinters or an  Executioner's Capsule, I probably would have cut white from the get-go. I  always worry about having an out to big fat dragon-class creatures (which red  burn can't handle), so I always try to fit in Oblivion Ring.Manaplasm was awesome for me exactly once when I played it on turn three with  a four drop and five drop in hand. But it was also really bad for me exactly  once when I drew it off the top in a losing situation.
