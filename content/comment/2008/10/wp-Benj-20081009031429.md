Nice blog you got here. Sana dumami pa ang mga pinoy MTG bloggers. ðŸ™‚Question: How do you make the decklists look like the way they do in yellow  boxes? Even the cardnames have links. Do you do that manually? I'm really  interested in having the same thing for my own blog. ðŸ˜‰Thanks in advance, and keep up the good work!
