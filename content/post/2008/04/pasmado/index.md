_Pasmado_ is a term generally well-known among Filipinos. It refers to a condition of excessive sweating and/or trembling in the hands and/or feet. The concept is so well-known among Filipinos that it has developed several old wives' tales of its' own, such as the ever-popular solution of peeing on your hands first thing in the morning to get rid of the conditions.

I am _pasmado_. Sometimes at least, especially when under stress or it's really, really humid. The reason I got to thinking about it was that I finally realized it was affecting the way I play in Magic tournaments. After a few rounds of playing Magic, it always happens that the card sleeves start sticking to each other due to my sweaty hands. It's quite a distraction and one my opponents even commented on my sweaty hands after the post-match handshake.

I thought about looking for a solution (one that didn't involve pee), and did a bit of research on the concept of _pasmado _online. The difficult part was figuring out what the condition was called in English. I asked a few people and none could give any decisive answer.

My brother claimed the concept did not exist in Western medicine so there was no English term for it. Some thought that the condition was fictional and only exists in old wives' tales. Quoting a Pugad Baboy comic: "Kung totoo yung pasmado, ano sa English yun?" "Edi pasmatic".

Eventually I dug up a [thread about pasmado on yehey.com ][1]that told me what the English medical term was: Palmar Hyperhidrosis. Sure enough, Wikipedia confirmed that [such a condition did exist ][2]. I even came across a website called [CureSweatyPalms.com!][3] 

The Wikipedia entry cites several drugs that reduce hyperhidrosis and there's even a surgery option for extreme cases. However, I didn't want to spend on medicine or god forbid surgery just so I could play better Magic. I've lived with this condition for as long as I can recall so I can tolerate it most of the time. I've decided to instead to take up the simplest solution I could think of: I'm going to buy gloves.
