Upon the prodding of [Mikong][1], I attended the recent [Barcamp Manila][2] held in Ortigas last Thursday. I wasn't really sure what to expect, as I've never attended any such conference before, and I've never been particularly involved with the local developer community, but I said I'd go anyway, I figured it'd probably be fun.

The event was held at the Orient Square building at the offices of [Exist Global][3] and [Morph Labs][4], who sponsored the event. I was a bit worried since I'm going in without having a presentation, although everyone is encouraged to present. Turns out I needn't have worried -- over 80 people attended the event, there wouldn't have been enough time for everyone to present! 

All in all, the talks were interesting, with a wide range of technical topics discussed involving multiple programming languages including C++, Java, Ruby and Python (with much playful jeering between the many Ruby advocates and the few Java developers). There was even a short comedy sketch by [Mario Carreon][5].

It felt good getting to know the community and meet some new people and see the cool (and geeky) things local developers are doing. Although I code day in and day out for work, I could probably still learn a lot from the development community. The uptake of newer technologies is a lot faster in the community than at work, so somehow it's a refreshing change of pace.

Hmm... I wonder if I would be able to rustle up something to present at the next Barcamp?
