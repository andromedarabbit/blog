Unfortunately the current trend of us moving towards generalization of skills  over specialization pretty much screws up the progress department -- we end up  with engineers who have a broad range of outdated unpolished skills than  engineers with less, but more honed, skills.Coding day-in-day-out also tends to give a false sense of \"experience\". As  I've said to Keis a couple of times already, \"There's a difference between 10  years of experience and 1 year of experience ten times over\". Even looking at  my own code a year ago makes me facepalm at how little effort we spend in  making sure that our \"tools\"/\"saws\" are sharp.", "date": "2008-08-22 23:31:21", "photo": ""}
