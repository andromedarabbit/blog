        A while back I got an email telling me that Adobe was sending out free Flex T-Shirts to people who had contributed to Flex 3. I had reported a few bugs on Flex JIRA, apparently that was enough for me to get a free shirt! The picture here shows the back of the shirt, the front just has a small Adobe logo. The "Fx" is composed of names of the contributors; my name is near the lower end of the "F"

Ah, yes...  the new shirt. I remember that he was trying to be subtle about it.
  
Una, kunwari may question so he asked me to come over his seat. Since I didn't
  
notice, he walked over sa JV area to parade his shirt. We eventually got the
  
hint ðŸ˜›
