I came across a website that provided an [online Speed Reading Test][1]. Most people I know generally know me to be a fast reader so I decided to take the test.

My results: 472 words per minute screen reading, at 82% comprehension, which the website says classifies me as a "good reader". Apparently the best readers can read at 700wpm at 85% comprehension, sounds tough =/

Try the quiz and post your results here.
