I came across a website that provided an [online Speed Reading Test][1]. Most people I know generally know me to be a fast reader so I decided to take the test.

My results: 472 words per minute screen reading, at 82% comprehension, which the website says classifies me as a "good reader". Apparently the best readers can read at 700wpm at 85% comprehension, sounds tough =/

Try the quiz and post your results here.

Damn I'm much slower than you. 294wpm screen reading at 100% comprehension. Though I have to admit I re-read some parts. I guess that makes me an above-average-almost-good-reader. hehehe

A good reader screen reads at 300wpm right? At 472wpm, I think that makes you a very good reader. ðŸ™‚
