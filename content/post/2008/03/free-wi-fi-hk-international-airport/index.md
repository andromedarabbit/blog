I'm blogging from an airport; I feel like such a seasoned traveler. Actually I'm writing this post just so that I can claim to post on the internet from airports.

I am of course flying back to Manila after a short 3-day visit to Hong Kong. People always ask me where I plan to go while in HK, even though I always come here to work. It's even worse this time, as I flew in Sunday evening, attending a three-day seminar until Wednesday, working during the evenings then flying back Thursday morning. Not much time to do anything really.

Ordinarily, I wouldn't want to take lunch at the airport because of the excessive price, but the check-in took a bit longer than I expected so I wasn't able to grab some food outside. The second mistake was ordering a fried noodle dish. It would have been fine if I was sufficiently skilled with chopsticks, but as it is I can only food I can manage relatively well with chopsticks are large pieces of meat. And fried noodles are served all bunched up together and they aren't straightforward to chew through, hence whenever I shove some into my mouth with the chopsticks, I feel like I would be unable to stop until I swallow it all (or choke, whatever). Eventually I just give up with about a third of the noodles still in the bowl. The flight will have some food anyway.

Whenever I'm bored and traveling I tend to think of random insane scenarios that I act out in my head. Examples:

While watching a 15-year old Chinese kid struggle with a Rubik's Cube on the MTR:

Me (stands up and walks over to the kid, extending hand): "Give me that!" (Grabs the cube and solves it in ten seconds flat, and immediately jump off at Central station while the rest of the passengers watch in awe)

&#8212;

While looking for a place to eat at the airport:

Me (walks up to a random Chinese woman): Hi, I'm hungry.

Chinese woman: Eh?

Me (making hand-to-mouth signs): Hungry! Give me some food!

&#8212;

Luckily, I never do any of these.
