Seriously. Having to hit an extra key just to use "Home&#8221; or "End&#8221;? For some reason, PrintScreen and CapsLock keys are higher priority than Home and End, meaning you don't need to use "Fn&#8221; to access them. Do people not use Ctrl+Shift+Home and Ctrl+Shift+End all the time? I'm sure a lot of developers do. Whenever I'm on this laptop and need to use Home or End, I mentally pronounce "Fn&#8221; as a seven-letter word starting with "F&#8221; and ending with "ing&#8221;.

I like laptops, but keyboards need to improve in some way. My suggestion? Remove the trackpad and have an extra row for those keys that you would have relegated to "Fn&#8221; status.Â  While using the keyboard is around 200 times more productive than using the mouse (citation needed), the mouse is around 200 times more productive than the trackpad.

Who designs these interfaces anyway? Do Mac users have similar issues?

I have a huge bad @$$ Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000, but I rarely use the
  
arrow keys, insert, delete, home, end, page up/down etc. I would rather keep
  
my fingers on the home row and Vim is perfect for that.
