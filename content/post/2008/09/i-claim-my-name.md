After trying out [usernamecheck.com][1], I decided to try claiming my username &#8220;roytang&#8221; at various websites. Here's a list of various websites where I have this username.

<http://friendfeed.com/roytang>&#8211; This one actually seems useful.
  
<http://twitter.com/roytang>&#8211; Okay, I admit it. I've actually had this for a few weeks now.
  
<http://pownce.com/roytang/>&#8211; I'm not yet too clear on what it's used for.
  
<http://roytang.posterous.com/>&#8211; would be useful if I didn't already have a blog
  
<http://roytang.livejournal.com/>&#8211; now I can be emo!
  
<http://roytang.pbwiki.com/>&#8211; I created this a long time ago. Recently I had to use pbwiki again so I revived the account.
  
<http://www.last.fm/user/roytang>&#8211; music I listen to.
  
<http://roytang.wordpress.com/>&#8211; As mentioned, I only got this account so I could activate Akismet

There's probably more. Sometimes when I see a random website I try out my username to see if I've registered before and this is successful more often than I expect.

Some &#8220;roytang&#8221;s on the web that are not me:
