My brother pointed me to a new (to me at least) online music service calledÂ [imeem][1]. The website caught my interest for two reasons.

1. It uses Adobe Flex, a technology which I've been using for the past year or so. Any Flex developer knows it's Flex just by looking at the widgets. (Click to enlarge the screenshot!)

2. The service allowed me to find an mp3 which I've never found before and have used as a benchmark for how good an mp3 search service is. The song is the Tagalog opening for Shaider! (Now I need to find a new benchmark)
