I usually have a stack of random printouts on my office desk. I also usually take one or two sheets of paper with me for meetings, supposedly to take notes (I never do). What usually happens with these papers is that I end up doodling. It's not a sign of my not paying attention to stuff mind you. Doodling helps me think, in some way.

I took photos of some of my doodles (yeah, no scanner):Â [Roy's Doodles][1]

plenty of doodles at the back. ðŸ˜€ Sayang, recycle them printouts so doodle at
