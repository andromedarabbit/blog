title: X-Men First Class
---

Just rewatched the ending of <em>X-Men First Class</em>. As far as origin stories go, it's pretty decent (although a number of continuity issues with the other X-Men movies exist). Charles getting crippled during the time that he and Erik part ways is certainly better than the canon comics story of him getting crippled by a random alien. The use of the Cuban Missile Crisis was also a good idea considering how the timeline matched up with Erik's time in the Nazi camps. It's too bad Magneto's character is tied to that particular time period - as time passes it will get harder to write Magneto stories as we're currently approaching the time when he should be around a hundred years old already. Future reboots might need a new villain altogether or maybe a rewrite of Erik's origin to replace the concentration camp traumas with something else.

Despite the mediocrity of the X-Men movies so far (they're ok, but they're no T<em>he Dark Knight) </em>I'm actually fairly excited to see where Bryan Singer is going to take the series with <em>Days of Future Past</em> as all indications point to the present day timeline of the 3 X-Men movies being the dystopian future to the timeline of <em>First Class.</em>

I also wouldn't mind Marvel coming up with a new series with a similar set of origin stories for Charles and Erik (and maybe some of the kids from <em>First Class</em>, but too bad for Darwin lol). Maybe when they have the next "Ultimate" universe eh?
