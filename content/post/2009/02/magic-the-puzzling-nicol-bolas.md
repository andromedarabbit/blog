At the Conflux release event, we were given posters of the four planeswalkers fighting againt big, bad Nicol Bolas. It got a friend and I talking: could Nicol Bolas actually win against the four planeswalkers?

The situation is:

Player A controls [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker][1], at starting loyalty.

Player B controls [Ajani Vengeant][2], [Tezzeret the Seeker][3], [Elspeth, Knight-Errant][4] and [Sarkhan Vol][5], all at starting loyalty.

Assuming each player has no other permanents and they cannot play any other spells. They can only use the planeswalker abilities. The goal is to destroy all planeswalkers on the opposing side.

If player A goes first, can he win? What if player B goes first?

Answers next week!
