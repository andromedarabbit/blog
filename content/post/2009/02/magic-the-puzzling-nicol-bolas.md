At the Conflux release event, we were given posters of the four planeswalkers fighting againt big, bad Nicol Bolas. It got a friend and I talking: could Nicol Bolas actually win against the four planeswalkers?

The situation is:

Player A controls [Nicol Bolas, Planeswalker][1], at starting loyalty.

Player B controls [Ajani Vengeant][2], [Tezzeret the Seeker][3], [Elspeth, Knight-Errant][4] and [Sarkhan Vol][5], all at starting loyalty.

Assuming each player has no other permanents and they cannot play any other spells. They can only use the planeswalker abilities. The goal is to destroy all planeswalkers on the opposing side.

If player A goes first, can he win? What if player B goes first?

Answers next week!

Whichever player goes first eventually kills all the planeswalkers on the other side:

Player B goes first: Elspeth makes 1/1, Sarkhan gives +1/+1 and haste, goon deals Bolas 2 damage, Ajani finishes him off with Lightning Helix. Tezzeret twiddles his thumbs.

Player A goes first: with no library considerations, Bolas kills Elspeth. Sarkhan gains loyalty, Ajani Lightning Helixes him, and Tezzeret does nothing important (can he gain loyalty?). Bolas picks off Sarkhan, the two remaining wait to die. With artifact creatures in library, Bolas kills Tezzeret, Player B retaliates as above, Bolas kills Elspeth, Sarkhan pumps critter, Ajani twiddles thumbs, Bolas kills Sarkhan, then Ajani.
