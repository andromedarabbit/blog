I saw the following question on Twitter:

> "People who write a lot of blogposts... How do you know when a post is done?"

Having written daily posts since October, I feel like I already qualify for "People who write a lot of blogposts", but I realized I don't have a straight answer aside from "When I run out of things to say".

I do worry sometimes that my posts don't often reach a logical conclusion. Maybe I'm just bad at ending blog posts and need to do better. Sometimes I'll keep writing until I run out of thoughts and just stop there instead of creating a summary paragraph or statement or conclusion or whatever. Well, maybe that isn't always needed? There should be value in committing your thoughts to the web either way.
