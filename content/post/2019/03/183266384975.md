title: Captain Marvel spoiler-free review!
---

<p>- movie was pretty good, no major issues<br/>- doesnt follow the typical MCU origin story &lsquo;formula&rsquo;<br/>- some weird pacing issues in a few places, but that just might be because of the chosen story direction<br/>- lots of little call-outs and tie-ins to the other MCU movies (although I feel like they could have done a bit more in some spots)<br/>- I am not a cat person. But if you are a cat person, you might like this: there is a cat.<br/>- There&rsquo;s some parts that made it obvious they were aiming for that Wonder Woman audience, so the movie may be better for you if you&rsquo;re in that demo (but I think WW was a better movie overall)<br/>- Imax was pretty good, nothing too excessive<br/>- Midcredits scene, and postcredits scene<br/>- Magugustuhan ba ni mama? Possibly! Also, its a good idea to bring little girls to watch this movie</p>
