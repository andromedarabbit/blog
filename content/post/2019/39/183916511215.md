title: Shazam! spoiler-free review!
---

<p>- I liked this movie, it had good heart, fun kid-friendly humor, and a strong message about family<br/>- basically the story of a kid with a messed up life being stupid and trying to be better<br/>- john glover is here! does he now hold the record for portraying the most number of parents of bald supervillains? that&rsquo;s not a spoiler right? <br/>- this movie is kid-friendly, aside from the violence and the occasional swear word<br/>- there is a mid credits scene and the post credits scene. one is sillier than the other</p>
