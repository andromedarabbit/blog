Hmm, surprisingly I haven't watched too much stuff this month.

### Eigasai

I watched a Japanese film at Eigasai in UP Diliman for the first time ever, upon the invite of some friends. We saw **One Cut of the Dead** a comedy zombie film. It was great and it was hilarious, although you must make sure not to lose patience with the first thirty minutes. I went in blind not knowing anything about it other than "Japanese comedy zombie movie", so you should too! Easily one of the funniest movies I've seen in recent years.

### Young Justice

Back half of Young Justice Outsiders finished this week. I've honestly been a bit whelmed for this half of the season as I feel like they're all over the place and there's too many plot threads going on at once.

### Fleabag

I didn't know anything about this Amazon Prime series going in either, only that it was a comedy and it was well-reviewed. I did enjoy watch it, although it's more of a tragic comedy than anything else. Basically about how people deal with absurdly difficult situations in their daily life. The story is well-told, but I'm not sure I get all the hype.

### Rocko's Modern Life: Static Cling

Netflix tried to bring Rocko into the modern era, although strangely none of the characters have aged at all. Although they are cartoon characters so I guess that makes sense? The special is about as ridiculous as the old cartoon was, unsurprisingly, although it does try to convey a message about how change is an inevitable part of life. I did like that they had a reference to my favorite episode, R-E-C-Y-C-L-E Recycle~

More next month! Maybe!
