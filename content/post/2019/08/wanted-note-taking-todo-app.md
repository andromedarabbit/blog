title: "Wanted: Note-taking / To-do app"
type: post
draft: true

I have a smattering of todo-lists and notes scattered over several platforms: plain text files, evernote, google keep, google docs, [standard notes](https://standardnotes.org/), and recently I also started trying [Trello](https://trello.com/).

I've found myself unable to quantify why I end up with such a fragmented structure. I figured it would help if I made a list of requirements I have for a note-taking / todo app.

1. Easy to edit notes
2. Can add and edit notes even on mobile
3. Can use as a todo-list
4. Can easily tick off items on a todo-list 
5. Have a record/history of when items are completed
6. Able to manage dozens, if not hundreds, of todo-lists and notes
7. Cloud backups
8. Provide different sorting options (by date, by priority, by due date, by project, etc)
9. Tag/group notes by project or other criteria
10. Searchable
11. Can easily export 

Evaluating each of my current methods against these requirements:

#### Plain text files (stored on Dropbox)

1. Pass
2. Fail
3. Pass
4. Pass, but need to do this manually
5. Fail
6. Pass, but can become unwieldy
7. Pass, via Dropbox
8. Fail
9. Maybe. Can use folders for organizing, but hierarchy is limited to one type
10. Pass, via file searches

#### Google Keep

1. Pass 
2. Pass
3. Pass
4. Pass, but need to do this manually
5. Fail
6. Pass, but will be very unwieldy
7. Pass
8. Fail
9. Fail
10. Pass

#### Trello

1. Fail. So many clicks!
2. Pass, I think. I haven't tried the mobile app yet.
3. Pass
4. Pass
5. Fail
6. Pass
7. Pass
8. Fail
9. Pass
10. Pass

I have the following use cases/scenarios:

- I think of something that I need to do while I'm away from my computer and want to jot it down quickly before I forget about it. Such things can include:
  - a work todo
  - an idea I want to investigate later
  - a blog post idea
  - something that I need to tell somebody
  - a project that I could work on
  - a game or book that looks interesting
  - something I want to read later
- I need to note something that I will need for reference at some future point(s). Examples:
  - a wifi password
  - API keys
  - the url for the production server
- Later when I have more time, I want to process these free floating ideas and organize them into lists, for example:
  - todo list, with due dates
  - post ideas
  - app / project ideas
  - steam or amazon wishlists
- some lists might be related to/children of an item in another list. For example, I could have a todo list for a specific project in the projects list
- I need some notes available as a quick reference on mobile
