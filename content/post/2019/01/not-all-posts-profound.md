title: "Not all posts have to be profound"
type: post
---

I think that's one of the reasons why it's difficult to keep up a blog. Blogs feel a bit like they have to be long-form, highly profound, useful or informative pieces or prose that a wide audience can appreciate. We don't have this same pressure when posting to other social media like Twitter or Facebook. 

I like to think of a blog (or this blog at least, at this moment) as a living, evolving thing, with each post capturing a single moment in a timeline, building upon previous thoughts, helping us see how the author's thinking changes with time. There is no need for each post to be perfect, only that they be honest.
