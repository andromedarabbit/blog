Here I am writing about [Duolingo](/2018/12/duolingo/) and [keeping up streaks](/2019/01/dont-break-the-chain/), then just a few days later, this happens:

Can't win 'em all. Surprisingly, the same thing also happened around the same time last year:

Goes to show how reliable a "New Year's Resolution" really is. Or maybe there's something about this time of the year or the coming back to work that makes it easier to break streaks around this time? I'll watch out for it next year!
