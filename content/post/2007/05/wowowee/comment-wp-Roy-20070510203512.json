I tend to overthink a lot of things, which means sometimes I'moverly critical. That being said, I only watched said shows because I was stuck in a room with people who were watching it. I'd never actually watch it on purpose, sexy girls or no. Something else that annoyed me: Some of the multiple-choice questions on Wowowee used to filter out contestants are actually kinda hard trivia questions, the sort where you have to be a bit familiar with the particular domain of the question to answer. It may seem like elitist thinking, but they weren't the type of questions you would expect the people who join these contests to be able to answer. It gives the show some pretense of being \"intellectual\" or maybe even \"educational\", when the contestants are obviously just randomly choosing which answer to pick.", "date": "2007-05-10 20:35:12", "photo": ""}
