At work, especially during assessment time, they often ask me if I have any concerns or needs or suggestions that I want to raise to management. And I never have any answers.

So I thought about it today, and I realized why I seldom have complaints: I'm a simple person. It doesn't take much to make me happy, and I figure I'm already ahead of the curve anyway. I have a fairly good paycheck, I like my job (more or less), I like the people I work with, and they recognize and respect me for my contributions.
  
_Lovelife na lang ang kulang :p_ 

And because I'm a simple person, if I have something to raise, I raise it as soon as I think about it; I'm not going to bottle it up until someone asks.

Of course, I still have my own ambitions or hopes and dreams. It's only natural to want to strive for something beyond yourself. And we all face problems, sometimes seemingly larger than we can probably comprehend. But no matter what goals we set out for ourselves or trials we face, you can always follow back on the simplest principle in problem solving: break things down into simple steps.

A hearty meal. Time with the people you love. Respect from your peers. A good nap. The best things in life are simple. Life is too short to make it complicated.
