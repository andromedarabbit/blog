Check. Yeap, I turned 29 a couple of days ago.

There's a typhoon signal no. 8 over HK right now as I type this. For people in the Philippines, that's hard to imagine since our local indicators only go up to storm signal no. 4. But it's really a bit calm where I am right now, some wind but not much rain. I'm not inclined to go out though, I'm running out of clothes as it is.

I'm flying back next Tuesday, hopefully the storm has dissipated by then. I miss my own bed. :p
