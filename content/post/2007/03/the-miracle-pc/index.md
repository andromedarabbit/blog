My computer died last night, refusing to boot. Ubuntu would complain of being unable to read the root filesystem. Windows XP would say that there's a corrupted DLL. I immediately arranged to borrow both an Ubuntu LiveCD and a Windows XP install disk the next day to help check the problem.

When I got home today, the computer had been miraculously fixed. My brother said he'd been using it no problem.

I knew before that the internet had the capacity to heal itself. I'm surprised my PC also this capacity.

I have no idea if I need to do any sort of diagnostics on this machine.
