This year, I resolve to find more direction.

That being said, I'm kind of behind already. I usually manage a total cleanup of all the stuff in my room before the New Year. This year? Not even close.

At least I have an additional 3 weeks of vacation to finish everything.

Review ofÂ [last year's resolution][1]:

"I will try more new things this year&#8221; : I'd say that's a resounding success. Especially with the trip to Hong Kong, I think I ate more new food there than I have during the past five years or so.

Yay for me.

Wow, not many people can fulfill their new year's resolution. Good for you
  
with that one!

Now as for this year, you have got a pretty vague one going&#8230; maybe that will
  
make it easier to achieve ðŸ™‚
