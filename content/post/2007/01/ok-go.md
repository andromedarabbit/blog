I'm testing the [Extreme Video Plugin][1] for WordPress, and I thought, what better way to do so than to further propagate the extreme music videos of [
  
Ok Go][2].

Some of the new guys at the office performed the above dance as their Christmas initiation&#8230;er, presentation, and let me tell you, the audience was on its' feet. Ok Go is an American band that is known for outrageous live performances like the above. The above video is their own song, "A Million Ways." They have another video for another song, [nvolving treadmills][3]. It's said that they did that treadmill thing _in one take_. That sounds too awesome to be true&#8230;
