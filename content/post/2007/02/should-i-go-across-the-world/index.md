title: Should I Go Across The World?

I've been asked if I would be willing to be temporarily posted in another country, halfway across the world, for around half a year.

On the surface, it seems like a good idea -- I don't have any definite plans for the next few months, so there's nothing in the way. It would be new stuff, new places, people, experiences, etc., a most welcome change of pace.

But the first emotion that grips me is fear. Of the unknown I suppose. Of doing something I hadn't done before. But then my focus on courage as a value comes through, and I recognize the fear for what it is: something to be conquered. I strike through the fear.

I will give my answer today. Will any of this come to pass?
