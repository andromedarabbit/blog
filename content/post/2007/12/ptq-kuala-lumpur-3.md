Dec-2, Sunday. Lorwyn Sealed. The usual location of course, NG Galleria.

I find your lack of socks&#8230;disturbing
   
_ 

I played a couple MTGO drafts the day before but did not do very well, I hoped my luck would be better this time. But my day did not start very well as I found that I had forgotten to bring sleeves to the event. I had to buy some rough-backed Ultra Pros. I hate rough-backed sleeves, my hands are not very good with them. For some reason, I was also stupid enough to come in my sandals, wearing no socks. I know from experience that this is stupid, as my feet will get sweaty and I'll be uncomfortable all day. Surely the above two whiny complaints are no excuse for the eventual beating that I get during the tournament (OMG spoiler!), but they couldn't have helped.

I open the following Sealed Pool:

Out of which came the following deck:

1 Moonglove Extract
   

   
1 Springleaf Drum
   

   
2 Boggart Loggers
   

   
1 Dreamspoiler Witches
   

   
1 Eyeblight's Ending
   

   
1 Final Revels
   

   
1 Oona's Prowler
   

   
1 Shriekmaw
   

   
2 Skeletal Changeling
   

   
1 Weed Strangle
   

   
1 Amoeboid Changeling
   

   
1 Ethereal Whiskergill
   

   
1 Faerie Harbinger
   

   
1 Glen Elendra Pranksters
   

   
1 Mulldrifter
   

   
1 Ponder
   

   
1 Sentinels of Glen Elendra
   

   
1 Spellstutter Sprite
   

   
1 Streambed Aquitects
   

   
1 Whirlpool Whelm
   

   
1 Wings of Velis Vel
   

   
9 Island
   

   
7 Swamp
   

   
1 Vivid Marsh

Seems pretty solid right? No outright bombs or anything, but the deck looks like it came out of a draft. I would do well, or so I hoped.

Round 1: 0-2 loss vs Urw

Wow. Not a good start. His deck was pretty good though &#8211; two Peppersmokes and two Tarfires kept me behind in the early game.

Round 2: 2-0 win vs (don't remember)

My opponent got a game loss for showingÂ  up late. I won game two easily.

Round 3: 0-2 loss vs Mono(?) white Kithkin

Wow, this was one of those moments where I completely blew it. Impulsiveness made me throw away this game and I vow it will never EVER happen again. It was game one, I was dead to his next swing, but 3 of my guys were fliers and I drew into Final Revels. I quickly went for +2/+0 thinking I had enough damage to win the game. As he considered his options I realize the miscount and that he would live with 1 life, killing me the next turn with two Kithkin guys with no blockers. Oh man, what an idiot. I just saw the Final Revels topdeck and played it without thinking. NEVER AGAIN. I figure I'll recover in game 2, but I draw no lands.

Sigh. 1 and 2 after 3 rounds. I figure I'll play until I get the 3rd loss, maybe win some packs.

Round 4: 0-2 loss vs GWb.

Oops&#8230;so much for that plan. I keep him back on tempo with Whirlpool Whelms and faeries, but he eventually overwhelms me with critters.

Facing lethal damage in game two, I pick up the result slip and tick the "Drop&#8221; option.

Sigh, one more PTQ to go, last chance to go to Kuala Lumpur. I made so many bloopers this tournament, and my mental game was so off&#8230;must do better next time.

But first, next week: Standard.
