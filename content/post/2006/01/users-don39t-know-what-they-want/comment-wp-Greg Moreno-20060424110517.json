This is not just about  writing specs and having them sign it.It is also an issue of expections. Developers sometimes (or oftentimes?)  assume that users know the capabilities and limitations of a program and that  these things should not be discussed with the users.We also need to be creative in helping users understand what we are trying to  build. Instead of writing a spec, use screen prototypes. Instead of using  PowerPoint to describe what the application can do, conduct a demo. Let the  users play with the program and observe them.", "date": "2006-04-24 11:05:17", "photo": ""}
