I've always been suspicious of radio station top ten lists, assuming they are predetermined marketing scams and not really based on actual listener requests.

When I was in high school I wanted to put this theory to the test by having a whole lot of people call one station and request a really old song &#8211; my choice at the time was "Hey Jude&#8221; by the Beatles. Unfortunately, my plan fell through because I could not gather the critical mass needed to accomplish it. And it was really hard to call into those radio stations.
