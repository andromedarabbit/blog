I think I'm starting to get the hang of this :p

This whole thing with Kubuntu, where I have to use Adept to install stuff is really weirding out my Windows-geek tendencies.

For today, all I wanted was to get some mp3s playing on Kubuntu. Unfortunately, the default included players (Kaffeine and Amarok) were giving me trouble, claiming they could not play mp3s! I asked around for some help, and read some FAQs, but I kept getting errors trying to download and install gstreamer-mad 0.8.

After a while I gave up and started mucking around in Adept to find an alternative program. I finally settled on installing Beep Mp3 Player, which proceeded to play my mp3 files ðŸ˜€ Yay! I can install stuff! BMP is a bit like Winamp2, so at least I'm familiar with it. I wonder if there are global hotkeys for it?

Also, now that I was a bit more familiar with Adept, I used it to install Firefox. But the repository only had Firefox 1.0.7! Wazzup with that?

For next time:

-- install Firefox 1.5.x

-- get my screen resolution above 1028&#215;768 (Edit, 20 mins. later: I couldn't sleep, so I went ahead and did this. I will probably be late tomorrow. I feel extra geeky now =/)

-- find more stuff to do
