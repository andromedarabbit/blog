Hmm... can I have both, and switch on the fly or something?I got Amarok to work after awhile... turned out I was doing something wrong  with updating the gstreamer update.I'll check out XMMS, but I'm really quite impressed with Amarok so far... it's  got some things going for it that Winamp doesn't.Thanks for the heads up... luckily, since I'm still just toying around with the  ubuntu install, I don't care much if anyone hijacks root or whatnot =pWhenever I boot into kubuntu, I'm on #kubuntu on freenode... although #ubuntu-  ph sounds better, para Pinoy hehe", "date": "2006-03-14 16:27:16", "photo": ""}
