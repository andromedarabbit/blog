_HeroesÂ _is a new TV series by NBC, covering the stories of several people who mysteriously gain superhuman powers. I just saw the pilot... it looks promising. There's this lady who strips online for a living, and apparently she has a murderous reflection. A guy who thinks he can fly. A painter who can create paintings of future events -- but only if he's high. A schoolgirl with an incredible healing factor. And my favorite -- a Japanese guy who wants to be a superhero and believes he's gained the ability to bend time and space. He's "Super Hiro"!

The pilot's style of rapidly shuffling the scenes between the protagonists turned me off a bit... but I suppose it's only because there's nothing linking their stories yet. At least not much. I'll follow the show in hopes it'll turn out good.
