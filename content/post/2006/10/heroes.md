_HeroesÂ _is a new TV series by NBC, covering the stories of several people who mysteriously gain superhuman powers. I just saw the pilot&#8230;it looks promising. There's this lady who strips online for a living, and apparently she has a murderous reflection. A guy who thinks he can fly. A painter who can create paintings of future events &#8211; but only if he's high. A schoolgirl with an incredible healing factor. And my favorite &#8211; a Japanese guy who wants to be a superhero and believes he's gained the ability to bend time and space. He's &#8220;Super Hiro&#8221;!

The pilot's style of rapidly shuffling the scenes between the protagonists turned me off a bit&#8230;but I suppose it's only because there's nothing linking their stories yet. At least not much. I'll follow the show in hopes it'll turn out good.

supah hiro is my favorite too! i love how he nonchalantly explained that he
  
"teleporto" to NY like "star trek" when interrogated by police.

sorta spoiler.
