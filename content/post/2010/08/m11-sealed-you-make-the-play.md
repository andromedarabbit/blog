Here's the situation: It's game 3 of a sealed game. You know your opponent has {{< card >}}Mind Control{{< /card >}}, {{< card >}}Aether Adept{{< /card >}} and {{< card >}}Plummet{{< /card >}} still in his deck, so you should finish it quickly to avoid losing to topdecks.

The field is as shown (click for larger view):

If you Stampede and swing with everyone, you win! Unless he has {{< card >}}Condemn{{< /card >}}, in which case you will lose. You never saw {{< card >}}Condemn{{< /card >}} in previous games. If you swing with everyone except {{< card >}}Platinum Angel{{< /card >}} he will fall to one life and you have to find a way to push through the extra damage later.

What's the correct play?

Swing with the team.

1. You Win
  
OR
  
2. He Condemns Angel, you gain 8 life. You are at 3. He MUST block with the three critters (unless giant growth) to not die. 4/5 tree becomes unanimated again. Play the Stormfront Pegasus. If he swings with the team, sac the boar to gain 4, leaving you at 7, then chump the largest flier. You are at 1 life with one more turn.

but that's a LOT of speculation! ðŸ˜€

What ACTUALLY happened, btw?

What actually happened was that I wish I never thought of Condemn. If I had swung I would have won, but as it is I forgot that the 4/5 tree would become unanimated and counted the counterattack as lethal so I didn't push and later lost to Plummet.

Misplay on my part obviously, if I had done the math correctly and figured I'd be alive at 1, then swinging with the team would definitely have been correct!
