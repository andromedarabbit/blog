In the middle of 2015, after 12ish years of working at the same company, I said to myself "I think I'm burnt out." 

<!--more-->

By the end of the year I had left the company. I didn't write about the burnout then, out of respect for my former employeer. But I'm ready to write about it now.

How do I know I was burnt out? I don't believe there is any generally accepted consensus of symptoms for burnout, but I had a good set:

- exhaustion, both physical and mental.

Symptoms:

- carrying the weight of a project by yourself
- going "above and beyond"
- Support requests come at all hours
- work time merges with personal time, no boundaries
- thinking about work all the time
- obsessive compulsive need to read and reply to all emails and messages and notifications immediately
- worsened by frustration with the same mistakes being made again and again re: scheduling, planning etc. the feeling that your concerns arent being listened to
- worsened by feeling of helplessness in the face of overwhelming number of project issues, re:scheduling, resources, quality issues, and so on

Worsened by trip to London, where I was almost 100% working all the time

Continuous cruch for scs

There is a never ending spiral of work in most companies

"The price for being the best is always having to be the best"

The sad thing is I did it again in 2018, but at least I had the sense to recognize it faster

I was paid very well

I was very good at my job

Duty is heavier than a mountain

How to avoid burnout:

- learn to say no
- set limits
  - guard your free time zealously
  - dont accept calls/messages outside of agreed upon work hours
- understand your own value
  - make sure you are compensated for all your hours
- build up your team
- regularly reflect on how things are going
  - try to recognize when you are close to burnout and step back asap.
