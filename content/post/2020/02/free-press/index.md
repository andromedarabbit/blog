Recent events (not the least of which is the [filing of a quo warranto petition](https://twitter.com/ABSCBNNews/status/1228299453238411264) by the Philippine Solicitor-General's office against the biggest local broadcasting company with the aim of taking back their franchise) have gotten me ruminating on the role of a free press.

Despite anything I may have said in the past, I do not necessarily believe that the role of a free press is to act as a check and balance against the government or even to [speak truth to power](/2019/02/truth-to-power/). Nor do I believe the free press's role is to act as propagandist or to always be spreading good news.

I believe that the role of a free press is to hold a mirror up to the world so that the rest of us can see the world as it is, good or bad.

### Unbiased?

Does that mean we should require a free press to be "unbiased"? Ideally yes, but "unbiased" and "biased" are problematic terms, ones whose definition may differ depending on the person and their particular agenda. Beyond that, even if we could agree on a definition for "unbiased", to ask a "mirror to the world" for absolute impartiality is to disregard the physical limits of such a mirror. No broadcasting or reporting entity could possibly report on anything and everything that happens, as that is an unfathomable infinity with each passing second. (For this same reason, I find it ridiculous whenever someone tries to argue along the lines of "Oh, are you really concerned about <Issue A>? If so, why did you never comment about <Issue B>?" I can't comment about everything, sir.)

Instead, the free press is expected to exercise some sort of editorial judgment to identify those stories and reports that are most relevant and/or most useful to society. And here again, we come to the subjective: "most relevant" or "most useful" will again largely depend on who is speaking and what agenda they serve. As an easy example, for people in power, it would be "most useful" if the press focuses on the great things they are doing and maybe try not to report too much on any allegations of excesses or wrongdoings thrown against them. 

### Too Negative?

A common complaint by government folk (at least hereabouts) is that the media always tends to report bad news most of the time. Why would that be? Aside from the obvious answer that "bad news sells", there is the "relevant and/or useful" filter to consider, both in the editorial discretion and in perception of the media. Good news about the government will tend to fall along the lines of "the government did its job today", which is not only unexciting, but also fails the "relevant and/or useful" filter. Can you imagine if your every day headlines were like "The trains all arrived on time today, all is well" or "No volcanoes erupted today." What would be the point of reporting that? Thus, the tendency is that reporting will naturally be biased towards the unusual or the unexpected. The fact that media is highlighting government's screwups and wrongdoings isn't a bug, it's a feature.

This bias towards unusual events skews the public's perception of media as well. The human mind tends to remember the more sensationalized and scandalous events, thus the effects of their reporting are overblown in our perception of the media. There is a general perception of the news always being filled with bad news because that's the kind of news that tends to stick in our head. This bias is part of our nature too.

Totally anecdotal, but consider this sample screenshot taken from the [Inquirer news website](https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/) as of this writing (early morning Wed, Feb 19):

Even if you argue that the articles in support of ABS-CBN are somehow "anti-government", the rest of these are regular reporting articles and three of them are even reports about how the government is doing its job (suspects nabbed in buy bust, cops hunting down suspects, QC implementing plastic ban). There is no clear anti-government bias here. (Also, all these articles are kinda boring unless they personally affect you.) I would however love to see a more rigorous, scientific study conducted of bias in the media. 

Ultimately, since we expect the free press to be a reflection of to our society, the best way to help make the news more positive is for our society to produce more good news as well. 

### Truthful?

Well, if we cannot expect that the media is unbiased, can we at least expect them to be truthful? This is on its face a reasonable expectation, but once again problematic due to relativism.
