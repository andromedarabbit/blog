title: Technical Interview Notes

I've had the good fortune to be on the interviewer side of technical interviews much more often than I've been the interviewee. I've been doing a few more of these over the past couple of years and made some notes, so I thought I'd talk about technical interviews for a bit.

In most larger companies, they'll have some kind of technical screening process where they make you solve problems (sometimes they're programming problems, sometimes they aren't). I talked about these kinds of technical screenings in [a previous post](/2016/06/the-programming-application-process/) about my own experiences as an interviewee. 

I'm not particularly interested in talking about these kinds of interviews for this post. Generally a company will have a standard set of technical questions to be used for this type of screening, and either the applicant gets it or not. Usually they will involve some sort of algorithmic coding, and sometimes you may use some third-party services that provide online checking, etc. The only real purpose of such screening is to determine that the applicant actually knows how to program and is not just pretending. 


What do we want in a senior dev:

- communicates well
- can push back when needed, i.e. hindi mabubully ng boss

What is your approach for estimation

- vague/high-level requirements, but the boss wants a definite timeline

How do you approach an unfamiliar code base

Experience in:

- what size of teams have you worked with
- source control - git etc
- database
    - SQL
    - performance
