Game by Game Notes:

### Megaman 1

From memory, this was definitely the hardest of the first generation of Megaman games. A lot of QoL features that made the later games a lot easier were not yet available, like passwords and e-tanks. The drop rate for powerups was quite low. The bonus item, the Magnet beam was missable - you had to repeat ElecMan stage if you didn't get it on first pass. Also, it had this behavior where enemies and powerups despawned as soon as they left the visible area of the screen. (Later games would have a bit of leeway for this.)

At first I tried playing it straight through and had a lot of difficulty even getting through CutMan and ElecMan stages, and after that I'm too tired/frustrated to continue. I don't have my 1990s reflexes anymore, so there's a lot of frustration and retrying. I complain to some gamer friends that the worst thing about Megaman 1 is that you have to be able to do everything in one sitting since there's no password saves. They wisely pointed out that the Legacy Collection should have save states, and they were right! Game-changer! At the very least, it lets me save my progress, and for very difficult spots, there's save-scumming. I'm old and slow, I will forgive myself for save-scumming in this Nintendo hard game.

For my full run, I start with GutsMan first, followed by CutMan, ElecMan, IceMan, Fireman, and finally Bomb Man. This order lets me avoid repeating ElecMan to get the Magnet Beam. 

Next are the Wily base sections. The most difficult single boss in the game is the one from the first Wily base section: the Cyclops/Yellow Devil. I recorded [my last few attempts against this boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiWhBlrGiK8), but I must have had around 30-40 attempts even before this video. You can see the savescumming in this video!

The most difficult sequence in the game however is the succession of four robot masters you have to fight right before Wily. They come in the order Bomb Man - Ice Man - Fire Man - Guts Man. Since this is Megaman 1, there are no health refills in-between, otherwise it would be much more manageable. It takes me a while, and a lot of savescumming, but I finally manage to push through just barely, then proceed to die once I get to Wily. I only had like 1/7th HP left at that point, so there was no point savescumming. Luckily, the game lets me start over right outside the Wily door. I remember that I have to use Fire and Elec weapons. It takes me two tries to beat the final boss. Woo!

Intermission: After finishing Megaman 1, I try some of the challenges. Some of them are manageable, some will take a lot of practice to earn gold medals. We'll see if I bother with trophy completion for this game.

### Megaman 2

I start with Bubble Man, and right off the bat I can see how much easier this game is, mostly due to the much more generous powerup drop rate. I even manage to pick up a couple of 1UPs along the way. I die a few times to miscontrolled jumps into the spike ceilings, but otherwise there's no issue. Bubble Man himself was easily defeated.
