Stuff:

- Early this morning I took a walk outside for the first time since the lockdown started. Previously I had only gone out for groceries and meds. Only for less than 30 mins, and only in our subdivision, walking up and down the street. It's good to be walking again, although this short and limited route is quite boring and full of neighbor's dogs barking at me, so I'm not too fond of it, but it's better to get the habit started again since I've been feeling the fatness piling on due to the quarantine and the lack of exercise.
- **Work**: A few consultation meetings here and there, but starting next week I may need to do some actual coding work for other people. 
- **Watching**: Watched a [few movies this week](/page/lists/2020/movies/), The Siege (caught it on TV during my lunch break), Skull Island (because Brie Larson), Ready Player One (it's Cyclops!), and also watched Ang Huling El Bimbo the Musical (Not really a movie, but ok). I also ended up watching the 2 episodes of the Battlestar Galactica miniseries; apparently I had not watched this before watching the 2004 series.
