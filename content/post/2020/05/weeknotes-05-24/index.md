My stuff:

- the weather has been so hot lately, I've taken to shifting my sleep schedule to afternoons so that I can maximize the use of the air-conditioning to when it's most needed. It also helps me be more productive, since I can get more things done if I'm awake during the cooler hours of the day. I think I'm more looking forward to the end of summer than the end of quarantine.
- a bit of consulting work this week, actually had to code some stuff. Mostly integration work, API calls, that sort of thing.
- I bought a [fancy new headset](/2020/05/hyperx-cloud2/) off Lazada this past week.
