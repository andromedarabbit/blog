My stuff:

- [This week's quarantine notes](/2020/05/covid19-05-24/).
- the weather has been so hot lately, I've taken to shifting my sleep schedule to afternoons so that I can maximize the use of the air-conditioning to when it's most needed. It also helps me be more productive, since I can get more things done if I'm awake during the cooler hours of the day. I think I'm more looking forward to the end of summer than the end of quarantine.
- a bit of consulting work this week, actually had to code some stuff. Mostly integration work, API calls, that sort of thing.
- The [fancy new headset](/2020/05/hyperx-cloud2/) I ordered off Lazada came in last Saturday.
- Not much gaming this week surprisingly.
- Watching lately:
  - Caught up with the "season finales" for Supergirl and Flash. In quotes because they literally just cut their seasons short and left a lot of cliffhangers to be resolved next season. Understandable, but so weird.
  - various streaming shows have started up again their seasons that I've started watching: Rick and Morty, Patriot Act with Hasan Minaj
- Site updates: Nothing to announce! Been busy.

If you're not familiar with him, he used to work at Google and wrote a bunch of [longish but really good software development related articles](https://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/) back in the day.

- Capcom has re-released [some old April Fools joke Street Fighter themed minigames](https://www.capcom-unity.com/2020/05/21/street-fighter-april-fools-mini-games-have-returned/)! I liked the [Street Fighter Academy one](/2020/05/1263976021444816896/), it's a trivia game!
- [Great writeup of LearnedLeague](https://www.theringer.com/2020/5/20/21264342/online-trivia-learned-league), a long-running trivia league that's invite-only. I kind of want to try to find a way to join, but it seems really tough! [Their website](https://learnedleague.com/) has an archive of all the past sets and their questions. I browsed through a month's worth of questions and they're really hard, I could answer maybe 1-2 in 10 questions on average.
