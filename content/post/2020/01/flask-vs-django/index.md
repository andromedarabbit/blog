In a bid to reduce the number of webapps actually running on my server (for resource consumption reasons), I decided to migrate a small Flask app I had and merge into this larger Django app where I have a lot of my personal data tracking stuff. It got me thinking, why did I build this using Flask in the first place? And that led to the more general question: when do I prefer using Flask over Django?

The usual quick comparison is that Flask is the more lightweight web framework

Personal experience: I'm much more familiar with Django than Flask, having started using it back in 2008. Professionally, I've also worked on more Django projects, compared to only one Flask project that actually made it to production.
