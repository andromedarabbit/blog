I was bored. And I was going through the
   
[Sinfest][1] archives. But then I thought, why should I bother going through these comics manually over the net? I'm a programmer, I'll make a [SinfestDownloader][2]!

I've left it running for about 4 hours now. There's a lot of Sinfest strips... around 40MB worth have already been downloaded!

I wonder if this violates any sort of copyright? ... 

Update: Done in a little over 4.5 hrs. Sinfest weighs in at a bit more than 1700 strips, and roughy 50MB of space. I wonder if I should try for Penny-Arcade? ðŸ˜›

If you want to test bulk, my suggestion would be PVPonline. Mario would
  
suggest Sluggy Freelance.

Technically, it does, since most webcomics come with the standard do-not-
  
distribute clause. However, most will not stop personal copies. Not a good
  
idea to spread the word to the public, though, to be on the safe side.

Penny-Arcade took me the better part of a day to download. Mostly because I
  
had already performed two runs before I realized I wasn't getting them all
  
because some were gifs!

I'll try for PvP or Sluggy Freelance when I have time. ðŸ˜€
