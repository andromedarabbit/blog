I would recommend that you check out some of the sample exams  or past exams (there should be some that are downloadable from the jitse  website I think), as these should help you greatly. The scope of the exam is  rather wide, I understand it covers a lot of Computer Science stuff (I'm no  ComSci grad so I don't know how accurate that is), there were questions on  terminology, algorithms, software engineering concepts, etc.", "date": "2007-03-22 08:46:23", "photo": ""}
