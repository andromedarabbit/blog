Note to self: Don't forget to check out the games at [Liberated Games][1] 
   
sometime in the future. They host commercial games which have been released for free to the public... some with source code. I mean, c'mon, they apparently have the source code for Star Control 2! (I say apparently because their download page seems to have a problem right now, hence I will get back to it later.)

Haha! I finished The Ur-Quan Masters v.0.3 (I think) a while back. It's a huge
  
download, but worthwhile for the voice. I think Ritchie still has my copy...

I'm not really one for such game editors. I'd prefer coding my own, if I had
  
the time/knowledge/patience. ðŸ˜›
