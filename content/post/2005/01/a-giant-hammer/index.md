{{< img src="hammer.jpg" >}}

We have a giant hammer prop at home. Made out of a stick and some cardboard (I think). Naturally, we bash each other with it. There are only four things I think of when I see this hammer:

  1. Those carnival things where you need to use the giant hammer to ring the bell
  2. Triple H
  3. The Paladin in Warcraft III
  4. Thor

That is all.
