At least, that's what I was thinking when I was listening to today's Gospel regarding the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_talents">parable of the talents</a>.<br /><br />Bsically, I think the gist of it is: God gives us talents, we should do the best we can; if we don't, how can we complain when others do better?<br /><br />Yeah, I pay attention in Church. Go me!
