title: Nanowrimo...Why The Hell Not?
---

I was introduced to <a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">nano</a> a few years back when some fanfiction writers I knew online told me about it. I've attempted it every year, and failed each time. I just don't have the drive.<br /><br />I figured I wouldn't start this year. After all, here I am, it's the ninth of November, and I don't have anything, prepared or otherwise, why fight a losing battle right?<br /><br />If you think I don't fight losing battles, you don't know me very well. Who knows, I may catch up and might actually make it this time.<br /><br />And I'll write in public too. I have no title, so bear with it -- <a href="http://roynano.blogspot.com/">roynano</a>.
