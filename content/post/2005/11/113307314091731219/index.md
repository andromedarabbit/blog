title: Yeah, I'm Not Gonna Make It
---

(Cross-post from <a href="http://roynano.blogspot.com/2005/11/yeah-im-not-gonna-make-it.html">here.</a>)<br /><br /><img src="http://geocities.com/zroytang/nano.jpg"><br /><br />I think I would've had a good chance to make it if I had started on time though. :(<br /><br />I'm not gonna stop though, I think I'll finish this novel.<br /><br />An excerpt:<br /><br /><blockquote><br />“I really should organize my stuff more. You’d think someone living alone deep in the woods would have a lot of time to organize, but no, there’s always one thing or another. Squirrels, usually. Silly things keep insisting their friends are nuts! Or the nuts are their friends, something like that; I never was very good at understanding their chitter-chatter, most of it is about nuts anyway. I think they have like two hundred different sounds to represent nuts, did you know that? It’s funny too how they attach the same meaning to the term “nuts” as humans do. How do you suppose they picked that up? I hope it’s not me, I don’t think I have a tendency to say people are nuts. Aha there it is!”<br /></blockquote>
