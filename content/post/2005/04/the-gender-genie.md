[The Gender Genie][1] 

Apparently, according to this handy web tool, I write like a girl, or at least I do when my posts exceed 500 words. How embarassing! Apparently I should be using more masculine words like "the", "good" and "something" rather than feminine words like "but" and "actually"!

Noted!
