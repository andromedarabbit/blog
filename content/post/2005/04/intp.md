</div>

Got this fromÂ [Peng's blog][1]. It's a simplified version of the Myers-Brigg personality test, which I've taken before, with the same results.

Well not really, my results sometimes vary from INTP to INFP. Each letter in the result stands for one aspect of your personality. In this case, Introverted iNtuitive Thinking/Feeling Perceiving. I'm pretty sure I'm somewhere dead even on the thinking/feeling scale. I often confuse myself, so I'm pretty sure the test would be confused as well.

Actually, I dislike memes. I seldom pay them notice. I like this one because I
  
like the Myers-Brigg test, which has a solid, well-known foundation in
  
psychology.

I think this is typical of an INTP
