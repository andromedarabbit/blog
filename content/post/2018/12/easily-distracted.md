Via [a blog post by Dave Martin](http://davemart.in/resistance/), I read about Steven Pressfield's quotes on "The Resistance" that keeps us from doing our work:

> The danger is greatest when the finish line is in sight. At this point, Resistance knows that we’re about to beat it. It hits the panic button. It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it’s got.

(Side note: I've put his books on an Amazon wishlist. I should remind myself to do this whenever I find books that sound interesting)
