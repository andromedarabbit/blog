It's actually kind of a light week this week. There's a couple of Marvel NOW! #1s coming in, and nothing too exciting particularly on the DC side.

The #1 I'm most looking forward to the most this week has to be Jonathan Hickman and Jerome Opena's <strong><a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&amp;id=14395">Avengers #1</a></strong> (link leads to preview pages). It's a new era for the Avengers as a new creative team takes over from Bendis, and it looks like Hickman will be bringing over his tendency for epic-scale adventures from the Fantastic Four books over to the Avengers franchise.

Then we have<strong><a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&amp;id=14401"> Amazing Spider-man #699</a></strong> which continues the Dying Wish story arc and the shocking reveal of the last book. Writer Dan Slott is very excited for the last two issues of the Amazing Spider-man run and has been hyping it up. A lot of fans are worried at where the franchise is going and who the new Superior Spider-Man will be, Dan Slott has two issues left to wrap things up in a satisfactory fashion and provide us an ending that lives up to the hype.

Seeing as how I'm always gushing about Bendis and Immonen's new flagship X-Men book, it shouldn't be a surprise that <strong><a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=preview&amp;id=14400">All-New X-Men #3</a></strong> rounds out the top of my list, hopefully the creative team gives us some fresh action this time around, looking forward to the original five coming face-to-face with present day Scott Summers!

Honorable mentions: <strong>Hawkeye #5</strong> is also out this week and has been a great book so far. We have another Marvel NOW! #1 with <strong>Thunderbolts #1</strong>, hopefully we'll be getting a good explanation of how this particular team gets together. This week we also get <strong>The Legend of Luther Strode #1</strong> from Image, the sequel to last year's critically acclaimed and ultraviolent The <em>Strange Talent of Luther Strode</em>, hopefully the series gives us a bit more story meat this time.
