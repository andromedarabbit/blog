Final Fantasy VI and all\r\ncharacters involved are copyright of Squaresoft.\r\n\r\nAuthor's note: This story takes place before the start of FF6.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, thief!\"\r\n\r\nHe heard the shopkeeper shouting after him, and grimaced. A couple of\r\nyears or so ago if someone told him he'd be stealing food off merchants in South\r\nFigaro, he'd laugh in their faces. He was a different man then, with different\r\nworries. The man he was today couldn't be bothered to think about such things as\r\nhonor or ethics. He was too busy thinking about food, and money. And his\r\nresearch of course. He had to do his research. What did it all mean otherwise?\r\nThe months of living off stolen food and money, moving from place to place,\r\nrobbing scholars and merchants alike, living as a thief. Damn, he said to\r\nhimself. These aren't the thoughts to be having while being pursued by Imperial\r\nTroopers. \r\n\r\n\"Hurry up, Biggs, he's getting away!\"\r\n\r\nHis somewhat stout companion was lagging a step or so behind him,\r\nadjusting his brown helmet. But he couldn't afford to slow down and wait for\r\nhim, he thought as he saw his quarry turn right into the next alley. This had\r\nbeen the chance they were waiting for, a chance to prove themselves to their\r\nsuperiors. He sped up the chase as his prey knocked down a couple of merchant\r\nstalls in his haste to get away. He looked around and tried to figure out where\r\nhis target was heading. Biggs was still right behind him, panting, but still\r\nrunning. They had known each other since they were kids back in their hometown,\r\ndreaming of becoming Imperial Generals. He looked back to his friend and shouted\r\nan unnecessarily rough command.\r\n\r\n\"Biggs, he's headed for the west side exit! Get the Guards to cover that\r\nside!\"\r\n\r\nBiggs nodded at Wedge words, and turned down the next corner to alert\r\nthe Figaro Guards on the west side. He was a bit miffed at Wedge' tone. They\r\nwere, after all, of equal rank, having been Sergeants in the Imperial Army for,\r\nwhat, two years now? His mind flashed back to the time he and Biggs were\r\npromoted, how happy they were that they were one step closer to their dream. He\r\nremembered that dream and forgave his friend's words. He was merely excited\r\nafter all, since this capture would undoubtedly lead to a promotion. He caught\r\nsight of the Figaro Guardsmen at their post, and stepped up his running a notch. \r\n\r\nDamn, he's still right behind me, the object of the soldiers' attention\r\nsaid to himself. He was a pretty fast runner, but this guy was hot on his tail.\r\nHe glanced back at his pursuer as he jumped down the steps from the rampart to\r\nground level. He looks young, he thought to himself, probably hasn't even been\r\nin the service five years, a private or a sergeant at most. He considered\r\nstopping and pulling out the dirk in his belt, as the guy probably wouldn't\r\nstand a chance. But he hated killing, and avoided it whenever he could. Besides\r\nthe guy just needed to hold him off for a few minutes before the Guard could\r\nsurround him. No, I'll just stick to the plan -- out the west side wall and off\r\nto Narshe. He turned the corner, stopped and fell back as he caught sight of the\r\nseven or eight Guards at the gate, with an Imperial Soldier commanding them. Oh\r\nwell, it was a bad plan anyway. He looked back to see the other soldier about to\r\npounce on him. He drew his blade and parried just before the sword cut off his\r\nleft arm. \r\n\r\n\"Hey, take it easy! I'm a thief, not a murderer!\" Not yet, at least.\r\n\r\n\"Hmph. I know who you are.\" Wedge made a feint, hoping to fake out a\r\ncounterattack. \"We've had reports of your activities in this area for some time\r\nnow. And your time is up.\" When his opponent failed to counter, he followed\r\nthrough, hoping to catch him in the right shoulder with a quick thrust.\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, kid,\" the thief said as he knocked the incoming blade to the\r\nside.\r\n\"But there's no way I'm letting myself get caught here.\" He turned around\r\nquickly, letting the man's thrust slide harmlessly behind him, and proceeded to\r\nknock him down with the hilt of his blade. He heard the soldiers coming before\r\nhe saw them, so he started running again as his opponent fell to his knees,\r\nhands massaging the back of his neck.\r\n\r\n\"Wedge, what happened?!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about me, just go get that guy!\"\r\n\r\nAs Biggs attended to his defeated partner, the thief looked back to see\r\nseven Figaro Guards in hot pursuit. Damn, I guess I'll have to go out the other\r\nside. I guess I'll be hiding in a cave again for a couple of days. He changed\r\nhis mind when he saw the guards gathered at the east side entrance. He sighed to\r\nhimself as he turned and ran up the stairs to the ramparts. Why did I always\r\ncome back to South Figaro anyway? South Figaro was well-manned, both by Figaro\r\nGuards and Imperial Soldiers, mainly because most of the trade between the\r\nEmpire and Figaro passed through here. That meant a lot of merchants to steal\r\nfrom, but it also meant you had a hell of a time escaping. Uh oh, he muttered as\r\nhe saw the two Imperial Soldiers who had chased him earlier right in front of\r\nhim. He looked around, jumping off the rampart was out of the question, there\r\nwere three guards on the ground level just waiting for him. And the other four\r\nwere right behind him. He stopped, shrugged, and turned to the two Troopers, a\r\ndespondent look on his face. It's not like he was worried about getting\r\ncaptured. After all, he'd been captured before, and he would probably be out\r\nagain in a couple of days. What bothered him was that the chase was over. That\r\nwas all he really lived for these days, the thrill of the chase. That and\r\nhis...research of course.\r\n\r\n\"I guess you got me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Like I said, your time's up. By order of the Imperial Magistrate, you\r\nare\r\nunder arrest, Locke Cole.\"\r\n\r\nBiggs produced a pair of shackles and Wedge grabbed Locke, pinning his\r\narms\r\nbehind him. He was about to snap on the shackles when the Figaro Guards came up\r\nto them.\r\n\r\n\"Release this man to our custody,\" the Guard Commander said to the two\r\nTroopers. \"He's wanted by the King of Figaro for crimes against the nation of\r\nFigaro.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? This man is wanted under Imperial Law, and we came here\r\nspecifically\r\nto bring him to the Emperor's justice.\" Wedge said. Although officially, they\r\nwere just stationed here as part of the \"diplomatic envoy\" to Figaro, they had\r\ntaken it upon themselves to prove their abilities to their superiors by catching\r\na notorious thief. \"It is our duty to bring him back to the Imperial Capital for\r\nsummary execution.\"\r\n\r\nExecution? Yeah, right. Locke wasn't worried about that. He felt a bit\r\nmiffed though, being fought over by two sets of soldiers.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry, Sergeant,\" the Guard Commander said, emphasizing Wedge's\r\nrank.\r\n\"But this man was captured on Figaro territory, and the King's Guards get first\r\ncrack at him. We're allies, yes. But that doesn't give your Imperial Army\r\nauthority in these lands.\"\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nHe was here again. It seems he was here every night. Wherever he was,\r\nhis\r\ndreams almost always brought him back to this place. A place he hadn't visited\r\nfor little more than a year now. Kohlingen.\r\nIt seemed only yesterday he was living in this quiet little town, an\r\naspiring treasure hunter. He used to love this place. He wasn't very well off,\r\nbut he had a house here, a cozy little place he had inherited a long time ago.\r\nHe loved the people here, the atmosphere, and the scenery. And Rachel. Of\r\ncourse, there was always Rachel.\r\n\r\n\"Don't be silly Locke,\" Rachel had said to him as they sat at their\r\nusual\r\ntable at the town's only restaurant. \"You've been in those caves a million\r\ntimes. What makes you think you'll find anything new today?\" She always needled\r\nhim about his 'job', or lack of it as the case may be. But she loved him. Of\r\nthis he was sure. He would never be able to provide for her in the way her\r\nparents wanted, but he knew he loved her as well, and that he would always take\r\ncare of her.\r\n\r\n\"Just a feeling I got,\" he had said with his usual air of confidence.\r\n\"There was an unusual cleft I saw the last time I was in there. I'm pretty sure\r\nthat there are other artifacts in there like the last one.\" He had found an\r\nancient spear in the cave before, and a scholar had verified for him that it was\r\nindeed an artifact, from the War of the Magi perhaps. Which was why he wanted to\r\nexplore the caves more. Rachel always worried about him, and he hated worrying\r\nher. But a few more artifacts like that, and the two of them could probably be\r\nset for life.\r\n\r\n\"No good will come of these 'artifacts' you know,\" had Rachel said in\r\nher\r\nmost lecturing tone, \"the War of the Magi ended a thousand years ago, and\r\ndigging up long-forgotten weapons won't help the peace any. Who knows, one of\r\nthese weapons you excavate could catch the interest of the Empire. What would\r\nhappen to Kohlingen then?\" Rachel's father was a scholar, a historian who\r\nstudied the War of the Magi. So her father always told her of the horrible\r\nstruggle that ended a thousand years ago, and how they should all learn from\r\nhistory's mistakes. She smiled at him, \"After all, if something were to happen\r\nto our little town, where would we live when we got married?\" Locke's face went\r\nred at the memory of her smile.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nLocke woke up to the sound of a voice from the other side of his cell\r\nwall.\r\nOh well, he said to himself. I've dreamed the same dream a thousand times\r\nanyway. The voice behind the wall repeated itself.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Locke said to the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, you're awake. I heard the guards talking about you. Is it true\r\nyou're\r\nLocke Cole?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, what of it?\" he responded cautiously.\r\n\r\n\"Wow! I've always wanted to meet you! You're my hero! I've heard all\r\nabout\r\nyour 'jobs' back in the Empire!\"\r\n\r\nLocke sighed. It's bad enough he was a thief. Now he was a famous thief.\r\nWith an enthusiastic fan. He curled up and tried to get back to sleep. \"You're\r\nthinking of someone else, just let me sleep.\"\r\n\r\nApparently his excited prison mate hadn't heard him. \"I'm Lone Wolf, the\r\npickpocket. I mean, I'm just a pickpocket now, but someday I'm gonna be a famous\r\nthief like you! So, when are you planning to escape? You are planning to escape,\r\nright?\" Another two-bit crook, Locke figured. They were being held in the prison\r\nin the basement of Figaro Castle. The Guards had taken him here after a rather\r\nheated argument with the two Troopers. He figured he'd stay for a couple of\r\ndays, if only to take advantage of the free food. But his 'friend' behind the\r\nwall didn't need to know that.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not gonna escape. Just go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? You can't be serious! I mean, they probably won't execute us like\r\nthe Empire would, but--\"\r\n\r\nThe voice trailed off at the sound of the far doors of the prison\r\ncreaking\r\nopen, something eerily noticeable in the darkness. A couple of guards walked up\r\nto his cell, one of them carrying a candle. Behind them, Locke could see the\r\nsilhouette of a tall, robed man.\r\n\r\n\"Locke Cole?\" The robed man turned to the guard for confirmation. \"The\r\nKing\r\nwishes to see you.\"\r\n\r\nLocke wondered what the King of Figaro would want with him as the Guards\r\nopened his cell and brought him to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Be strong, man!\" His unseen friend spoke out to him again, albeit in a\r\nmore subdued voice. \"You can get out of this!\" He never heard from that guy\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nEdgar Roni Figaro, king of the small nation of Figaro, was in his throne\r\nroom. You'd think someone who was royalty would be surrounded by servants\r\nwilling to do his every bidding. But Edgar didn't really like servants hovering\r\naround him, except for the occasional pretty servant girl perhaps, but not\r\ntoday. Today, there were greater concerns to be met.\r\n\r\nThe king of Figaro was conversing with a bearded old man standing in\r\nfront\r\nof his throne. If not for the throne, one might think Edgar actually deferred to\r\nthe old man, instead of being the king that he was.\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure about this, old friend?\" Edgar asked the old man.\r\n\r\n\"He would be a great help to us, I'm sure,\" came the reply, \"and you\r\nknow\r\nwe need all the help we can get.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can you be sure he'd agree?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just leave it to me.\" The old man smiled knowingly.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor of Figaro, wrapped in his flowing red robe with golden\r\ntrimmings, strode into the throne room. \"Beg your pardon, your majesty, but the\r\nprisoner is here.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, bring him in.\" Edgar nodded briefly to the old man, who then\r\nmoved conveniently to the shadows in the far wall.\r\n\r\nThe two guards nudged Locke into the throne room. He complied and walked\r\ninto the room with no hint of awe or majesty at Figaro's throne room. It was\r\nmajestic, yes, worthy of a king, but nothing he had not seen before. The guards\r\nbrought him before the throne.\r\n\r\n\"Kneel.\" The guard gruffly ordered, and Locke felt his head pushed to\r\nthe\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\"Get up, you know I hate that.\" Edgar said. The guards complied, lifting\r\nLocke back to his feet. Locke looked up at the king of Figaro. He's younger than\r\nI thought, Locke said to himself, what does he want with me?\r\n\r\nLocke looked around the room and took note of any means of escape. There\r\nwere six other guards, aside from the ones holding him, and two more outside the\r\ndoor; the fat old chancellor who had taken him out of his cell; and an old man\r\nstanding to the side, trying to remain unnoticed. Who is he? Some sort of\r\nservant?\r\n\r\nHe heard the king speak again and focused his attention to the throne.\r\n\"Thank you for bringing him here, Chancellor. Please leave us, I wish to speak\r\nto him in private.\"\r\n\r\n\"But your highness,\" the Chancellor started, a bit ruffled, \"We can't\r\nleave\r\nyou alone with this--\"\r\n\r\n\"It's alright.\" Edgar looked at the guards. \"And please remove his\r\nshackles.\"\r\n\r\nThe guards looked at one another before complying. Locke felt the\r\nshackles\r\ncome off, and rubbed his wrists to warm them. He saw the king nod to the other\r\nguards, and they accompanied the chancellor out the throne room.\r\n\r\n\"With all due respect your highness,\" Locke finally said, \"You sure you\r\nwanna be alone with me? I'm a dangerous thief you know.\"\r\n\r\nEdgar smiled. No respect for authority in this one, he thought to\r\nhimself.\r\nHe looked to the shadows on the wall, and the old man stepped forward. Locke\r\nfinally got a good look at him, although he still couldn't recognize the man.\r\nThe old man spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we know all about you Locke Cole. A very daring thief, who has\r\nconducted various operations throughout the imperial domains and beyond over the\r\npast few months.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've got quite a reputation you know,\" Edgar said, looking directly\r\nat\r\nhim, \"You're wanted for about twenty-seven charges of theft, breaking and\r\nentering and evading arrest in Figaro alone. You're lucky we don't execute\r\nthieves like the Empire does.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Empire...\" Locke thought a bit before speaking again. \"Listen, I\r\ndon't\r\nknow what dirty work you and your allies want me to do, but I don't care. I may\r\nbe a thief but there's no way I'm doing Gestahl any favors!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said.\" The old man spoke again. \"Just what we would have expected\r\nfrom you. And just what we wanted.\" He paused before going on. \"We are not the\r\nEmpire.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talking about old man? Figaro's practically Imperial\r\nterritory with all those soldiers running around and your king bowing and\r\nscraping to that old dog of an Emperor--!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey, hey,\" Edgar interrupted. \"The king of Figaro doesn't bow or scrape\r\nto\r\nanyone. The Empire and Figaro are allies, yes. Equally? No. They forced this\r\nalliance down our throats, knowing we had no choice, but Figaro will never bow\r\ndown to the Empire.\"\r\n\r\n\"So what are you doing here, then?\" Locke sneered, \"Hiding in your\r\ndesert\r\ncastle while Imperial Troops harass your people and tax your merchants.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to explain,\" the old man said. \"Edgar here, king of Figaro,\r\nand\r\nmyself, are members of a small underground group working to destabilize the\r\nEmpire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rebels?\" Locke said incredulously. \"You've got to be kidding. There's\r\nno\r\nway Figaro's army could stand up to the Empire. They've only used a fraction\r\ntheir power to dominate the Southern Continent, and even the King of Doma is\r\nhaving a hard time against them!\"\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly why Figaro is still openly an ally of the Empire.\" Edgar\r\nexplained. \"We have no intention of meeting them in war, as that would only\r\nresult in a bloody loss. But once Doma falls, it's pretty certain that Figaro\r\nwill be their next target.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have no means of fighting them, really,\" the old man continued,\r\n\"Except\r\nwith our hearts and with our minds. We have supporters scattered throughout the\r\nEmpire, waiting for our word. We have people disrupting Imperial supply lines,\r\nsabotaging their machinery. We may not be able to topple them today, or anytime\r\nsoon, but we will eventually. But we need help. We need more people.\"\r\n\r\n\"People like you,\" Edgar said, looking directly at Locke.\r\n\r\n\"What do you think I can do?\" Locke said, \"I'm just a thief. I can't do\r\nanything against an Empire!\"\r\n\r\n\"'A small stone may make a ripple at first, but someday it will be a\r\nwave.'\" Edgar said, \"An ancient quote.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are no ordinary thief, Locke Cole.\" The old man said, \"You were\r\nonce\r\nthe best treasure hunter in Kohlingen. We need someone like you, someone who can\r\nwork their way through Empire lands, disrupting their communications and supply\r\nlines, providing and gathering information. And most importantly, to contact our\r\nallies. It has become increasingly dangerous for me to meet with our allies like\r\nthe king here.\"\r\n\r\n\"If the Empire finds out we've been meeting with our allies in secret,\r\nit's\r\nhard to tell what they'd do.\" Edgar said, \"Especially since some of our contacts\r\nare deep inside the Imperial hierarchy. What do you say? Not much pay, but you\r\ndon't really do these things for the money do you?\"\r\n\r\nLocke paused for a while. These guys knew him inside out, and his\r\nconscience begged him to help them out. But there were other things he had to\r\ndo, something else he was fighting for.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nHis memory flashed back to that fateful day. He had wanted to show\r\nRachel\r\nthe buried ruins he had found in one of his explorations up on Mt. Kolts. With\r\nall the artifacts there, he was pretty sure they would be pretty much set for\r\nlife. It had taken him a while to convince her to come with him, but he\r\neventually got her to agree.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry, I'll watch over you every step of the way.\" He grinned at\r\nher\r\nas they strode up the mountain path.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure you will,\" Rachel replied, \"the same way you were watching\r\nover\r\nthat bar girl the other night, eh?\" She smiled at him teasingly.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, I told you, she looked just like my cousin!\" Locke smiled right\r\nback\r\nat her. \"The cave's just beyond the next bridge.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'd better hurry,\" Rachel said, pulling close to him. \"If my parents\r\nfind\r\nout I've been gallivanting with you--\"\r\n\r\n\"--they'd chase me out of Kohlingen, right. Don't worry, I'll just show\r\nyou\r\nwhat I've found, and have you back in Kohlingen before your father can give you\r\none his trademark lectures.\" Locke stopped and faced her, made a stern face and\r\nstarted to mimic her father. \"I don't know what you see in that Locke fellow!\r\nHe's a regular rapscallion, that he is! He'll do you no good, you hear!\"\r\n\r\nRachel laughed at him and slapped him lightly on the chest. \"Knock it\r\noff,\r\nokay? I can see the bridge already.\"\r\n\r\nRachel had stopped at the summit just before the bridge. She looked off\r\ninto the southward horizon, at the small town seemingly a lifetime away.\r\n\r\n\"South Figaro looks so... small from up here.\" This was the first time\r\nshe\r\nhad ever climbed a mountain, and the natural beauty she could see amazed her. \"I\r\ncould see for miles... everything is so... pristine...\"\r\n\r\n\"C'mon Rachel, you're the one who told me to hurry!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh... yes.\" She said, hurrying over to him. \"I would be a little more\r\nexcited if you maybe told me what it is we're going to see.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not gonna believe what awaits us up here!\" Locke said as he\r\ncrossed\r\nthe bridge. \"Come on, it's worth a fortune!\"\r\n\r\nEverything else had seemed to happen in slow motion. It was a moment he\r\nhad\r\nrelived time and again. His footing had been wrong, and he had felt the bridge\r\nbegin to give way. He heard her shouted warning, but had been caught unawares\r\nwhen she threw herself at him. He had been so surprised that he wasn't able to\r\nput up any resistance. He had felt himself pushed back to the far end of the\r\nbridge. He had stumbled clumsily, and his instinct took over as he jumped clear\r\nof the collapsing bridge. He had looked back, and she was not there. He ran to\r\nthe edge of the ravine, shouting her name without hearing anything. He had\r\nclimbed down after her, and everything else was a blur. Rushing her back to her\r\nfather's house, the worried looks on her parent's faces, the relief when the\r\ndoctors said she'd be fine, and finally, that blank look on her face when she\r\nwoke up to him. No gleaming eyes or bright smile. Simply an emotionless stare,\r\nas if she had never seen him before.\r\n\r\nHer parents had been outraged, but he had just sat there, not knowing\r\nwhat\r\nto do or say. He tried to speak, but Rachel's father wouldn't even hear of it.\r\nHe was chased out of Kohlingen by nightfall, nowhere to look or turn.\r\n\r\nHe couldn't remember how he had wound up in South Figaro, or how long he\r\nhad been there. He didn't know how he was able to survive, living off food he\r\nfound or stole off the streets. Somehow, he found himself under the care of an\r\nold scholar who had retired to South Figaro. The weeks of desperation had taken\r\ntheir toll on him and he was bedridden for several days. But he had found\r\ncomfort with the old man who listened to his story, the only one he ever told it\r\nto. He had poured his heart out, sometimes with tears running down his face, as\r\nhe recounted Rachel's tragedy. Luckily, his newfound friend had with him a\r\nglimmer of hope that brought him out of his stupor.\r\n\r\n\"I can't be sure about this, you know,\" The old scholar had droned in\r\nhis\r\nmonotone voice, \"But I seem to recall an old chap a while back who had done\r\nresearch on this sort of thing... memory loss and recovery, I believe.\" Locke\r\nremembered how his face had lit up when he realized what the old man was saying.\r\nA cure? Rachel's condition can be cured?\r\n\r\n\"Well, as I said, it's somewhat of a long shot,\" the old man said, \"but\r\nI\r\nthink the old chap was one of the Empire scientists.\"\r\n\r\nAnd so his hunt had began. After thanking his benefactor, he had set off\r\nfor Imperial territory, determined to find a cure for her recovery. He lived by\r\nstealing off merchants and Imperial officers, traveling throughout the Southern\r\ncontinent, asking scientists and researchers about this so-called cure.\r\n\r\nAnd all for what? Locke asked himself as he considered the offer being\r\nmade\r\nto him. He had been searching for almost a year now, with not even a single\r\nclue. He was wanted for numerous crimes throughout the empire, but he couldn't\r\neven sneak into the fortress at Vector to question their scientists. Maybe, this\r\njob was the right thing for him to do? No, he decided. He had already devoted\r\ntoo much time and effort to what he was doing, it all had to mean something, he\r\nhad to do it, for Rachel.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" He replied to Edgar and the old man, \"I understand your\r\nneeds,\r\nbut there are some things I just have to do, some things that are more important\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\nEdgar frowned a him. \"I don't think I have to remind you that you're a\r\ncriminal under my jurisdiction.\" He looked straight at him, \"I hold your life\r\nin my hands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that supposed to be a threat?\" Locke said mockingly, \"I've escaped\r\nworse fates than this before.\" He stood there defiantly, as if daring Edgar to\r\nstrike him.\r\n\r\n\"Now, now, no need to be hostile to each other\", the old man said\r\nsoothingly. The two backed down a bit. He looked at the young king. \"Edgar, no\r\nneed to be rough with him, is there? I'm sure you can arrange a 'pardon' for\r\nthis young man, can't you? So that he can consider our offer.\" He turned back to\r\nLocke. \"Please take the time to consider it, you don't have to decide now.\" The\r\nold man looked at Edgar, \"Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right, tell you what,\" Edgar sighed resignedly, \"I'll tell some of\r\nthe\r\nguards at the night shift to take an early break around midnight, okay? Just\r\ndon't hurt any of my guards.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man nodded and turned back to Locke. \"We can't force you to help\r\nus, that isn't our way. But please think about it. If you wish to contact me,\r\ntalk to Arvis of Narshe, I'm sure you know him.\" He smiled at Locke. \"My name is\r\nBanon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or, you could just get yourself caught again,\" Edgar grinned as he went\r\nto\r\ncall the guards back.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nLocke nudged his chocobo to go just a bit faster. He was anxious, and at\r\nthe same time worried. He hadn't been back to Kohlingen for the past year, but\r\nhe needed to go back now. He needed to reassure himself that he was doing the\r\nright thing, to remind himself what he was fighting for.\r\n\r\nHis conscience had been bothering him since the guard brought him back\r\nto\r\nhis cell. He had wanted to catch a couple of hours sleep before midnight, but he\r\nkept thinking about what it is that he was he was doing. He was on a wild-goose\r\nchase, he could recognize that, for some cure that may or may not exist. But he\r\nhad to do it, because he owed it to her, to fight for her. To protect her. But\r\nnow, he had turned his back on people who needed him, people he could help, to\r\npursue this unknown cure. Had he met the right choice? He would know when he saw\r\nRachel again.\r\n\r\nSure enough, the guards left around midnight, and Locke had been the\r\nonly\r\nprisoner awake. He had looked around warily, still not sure what to make of the\r\nsituation, but then started to work on the cell's lock. Nothing too difficult,\r\nhe was out of the dungeon in three minutes. He had promised not to hurt any of\r\nthe guards, but he had to knock a couple of them unconscious and steal a\r\nchocobo.\r\n\r\nAnd now here he was, just a couple of miles to Kohlingen now, and he\r\nwould\r\nsee her again. He didn't need to talk to her, just to see her. To remind himself\r\nof what he was doing, and why.\r\n\r\nOff the horizon, in the direction of Kohlingen, he sighted a thick\r\npillar\r\nof black smoke rising from the ground. Worried, he kicked his chocobo into high\r\ngear.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe sight was disturbing. The slightest traces of dawn had begun to\r\nappear,\r\nand the rays of light seemed to grotesquely outline the destruction that had\r\nhappened here. Several houses were burned to the ground, some had collapsed on\r\nthemselves, now simply a heap of wood and rubble. As Locke rode into the city\r\nand through the empty streets, he could feel several eyes looking out of the\r\nhouses that were still standing.\r\n\r\n\"What the hell happened here?\" Locke pondered for a moment before his\r\nheart\r\ntook over again. \"Rachel!\"\r\n\r\nHe got off his Chocobo, and took a shortcut down a narrow alley. Looking\r\naround, he saw that most of the brick-and-mortar houses here had survived\r\nwhatever it was that caused this carnage, so he figured Rachel and her family\r\nwould be alright. His stomach turned as he saw the remnants of their house\r\ncollapsed on the ground like a random pile of rocks. He stood there gaping for\r\nseveral moments before he heard someone call out to him.\r\n\r\n\"Master Locke!\" Seymour, Rachel's family's manservant, came running up\r\nto\r\nhim. He was a skinny man in his late forties, and he was often sympathetic to\r\nLocke and Rachel's relationship even when his master didn't approve.\r\n\r\n\"Seymour!\" Locke said in relief, \"What happened here? Where's Rachel?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was the Empire, sir!\" Seymour spilled, as he stopped in front of\r\nLocke,\r\ngasping for breath. Even though he was almost fifty, he had always insisted he\r\nwas healthy enough to run a marathon. \"They came through here last night, saying\r\n'Imperial enemies' had been hiding here.\" He looked around. \"They burned down\r\nand destroyed houses and buildings with some new weapon they had. MagiDuck, or\r\nsomething such, sir! A ghastly meld of monster and machine, a weapon of\r\ndestruction...\" He looked at Locke, \"It's good to see you again, sir, despite\r\nthe circumstances...\"\r\n\r\n\"Rachel!\" Locke almost shouted, \"Where is she? Is she alright?\"\r\n\r\nSeymour hesitated before replying. \"Best you go see for yourself sire,\r\nshe's at Largo's right now.\"\r\n\r\nLocke nodded, and hurried off. \"Thanks, Seymour. Get some rest, you\r\nhear?\"\r\n\r\nPutting aside his concerns for Seymour's health, Locke made his way to\r\nthe\r\nherbalist's shop. Old Largo, the medicine man of Kohlingen, had done many good\r\nthings for him back when he was still climbing mountains and all. Hopefully,\r\nRachel would be alright.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nHe had been sitting on this bench for half a day now. He felt so\r\nuseless.\r\nAll his efforts, all his sacrifices to find a cure for Rachel, and what happens?\r\nHe's not there for her at the time she needed him most. Largo had told her what\r\nhappened, how their house had collapsed on top of them. Seymour and the others\r\nhad dug through the rubble, expecting to find only their dead bodies. Rachel's\r\nparents didn't make it. But surprisingly, Rachel did. She had been holding\r\nsomething in her hand when they found her, gasping for breath, bruised and\r\nbattered all over. She had been delirious and weak as they carried her to\r\nLargo's for treatment, mumbling all the way. Once they laid her down on a bed,\r\nshe had promptly collapsed and had not awakened since. She had dropped whatever\r\nit was she was holding, a small pendant which had given her something to live\r\nfor, which Largo had seen fit to give to Locke.\r\n\r\nHe fingered the small pendant Largo had given him, and opened the\r\nlocket,\r\nthe same way he had been doing for the past few hours. The picture inside was a\r\nbit burned at the edges, but he could nonetheless see their faces so clearly.\r\nLocke and Rachel. They had taken this picture several months before the\r\naccident, and she had promised to treasure it forever. He closed the locket and\r\nslammed his fist into the ground as he recalled Seymour's words. \"She was\r\nmumbling your name all the way, sir, even before we found her in the rubble, and\r\nup to the time she fainted.\"\r\n\r\n\"So bloody useless,\" he muttered to himself, \"What the hell have I been\r\ndoing this past year, what the bloody hell has it all been for?\"\r\n\r\nHe remembered Largo telling him about her condition. He said she was in\r\nbad\r\nshape, and that it was a miracle she survived. He had given her some medicine to\r\nkeep her from the brink of death. But that was the best he could do. He didn't\r\nknow whether she could be revived in any way. The herbs would keep her like\r\nthis, in a form of suspended animation, for a long while, but that was the best\r\nhe could do. For all intents and purposes, it was as if she were already dead.\r\n\r\nBloody useless, Locke repeated to himself. What could he do now? Raise\r\nthe\r\ndead? A slight rain began to fall.\r\n\r\n\"Master Locke,\" he heard Seymour's voice behind him, \"You should get\r\nsome\r\nrest. And get out of the rain, sir.\"\r\n\r\nHe ignored him for a while, and eventually Seymour's voice vanished from\r\nhis hearing.\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe next dawn found him still in the spot, staring lazily at the\r\nherbalist\r\nshop across the street. The rain had stopped a few hours before, but he was\r\nstill quite drenched. He felt his eyelids starting to fall, for the umpteenth\r\ntime now, and snapped himself awake. He heard footsteps behind him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry.\" The voice was the old man's. The one he had met in Figaro\r\nCastle. What did he say his name was? Oh yeah, Banon.\r\n\r\n\"I came up here as soon as I'd heard.\" The old man sat down beside him.\r\n\"We\r\nknew of your history with the girl here in Kohlingen, and we knew that was why\r\nyou didn't want to join us. Too bad things had to be like this.\"\r\n\r\nLocke's silence disturbed him but he went on, \"Listen, about the\r\noffer...\"\r\nBanon wasn't sure what to say, but he decided to press on, \"...we understand if\r\nyou choose to decline. After all it must be a difficult time for you ri--\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll do it.\"\r\n\r\n\"--ght now. Eh?\" Banon turned to him in surprise.\r\n\r\n\"Rachel would've wanted me to help you guys, I guess,\" Locke said\r\nresignedly, \"She always said the Empire would someday threaten Kohlingen. I\r\nnever really listened to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Locke--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry about me. I've had a long time to think about things. I\r\nsacrificed a lot of things trying to bring back the Rachel I knew, only to have\r\nthe Empire take her away again. I owe it to her to fight for the ideals she\r\nbelieved in. I have to do this now, or else, it all has no meaning.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man nodded. \"Very well. I'll be staying at the inn. When you're\r\nready, just look for me there alright?\"\r\n\r\nLocke nodded. He stood up and looked down at himself. \"I guess I should\r\nclean up a bit, huh? Maybe Largo's awake already.\" He started towards the\r\nherbalist's shop.\r\n\r\n\"Oh and Locke,\" Banon started to say.\r\n\r\nLocke looked at him questioningly.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to the Returners.\"\r\n\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nfinis\r\n\r\n\r\n",

She looked up to her companions. \"That's amazing.\"\r\n\r\nKai simply nodded at her. He had seen all this before, and every time a new SeeD\r\ncame to watch the launch process the reaction was always the same. He looked at\r\nthe other SeeD beside him, Mecis' \"special friend\", as she put it. Laguna\r\nHilmark looked on at the launch process in a bored sort of way, as if it was\r\nnothing out of the ordinary, even though this was his first time at Lunar Gate\r\nas well. \"What's up, Laguna?\" Kai said, \"It's something, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, well,\" the 21-year old SeeD drawled, \"I've seen it before in the training\r\nsimulations.\"\r\n\r\nKai smiled. \"Training isn't much compared to the real thing, kid.\" Laguna and\r\nMecis had been SeeDs for little more than three years now, but they had spent\r\nmost of their time in administrative functions rather than actual combat duty.\r\nThis was only Mecis' second assignment outside of Garden, but Laguna had far\r\nmore actual combat experience, and he tended to act like nothing surprised him\r\nanymore.\r\n\r\n\"Next please.\" The technician handling the launch pods gestured towards them.\r\n\r\n\"Mecis, you're up.\" Kai gave her a friendly pat on the back. \"It'll be fine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Er, yeah...\" Mecis said not a bit nervously, \"It's safe right?\"\r\n\r\nLaguna put an arm around her to reassure her. \"Don't worry. You've seen the sims\r\nright? It'll be over before you know it.\"\r\n\r\nMecis nodded, and Kai couldn't help but chuckle to himself. He had known these\r\ntwo since they were cadets at Trabia, being one of their instructors, and he\r\nknew that Mecis always had a tendency for travel sickness. 'She should be fine\r\nif Laguna's with her', he figured.\r\n\r\nLaguna helped Mecis into the launch capsule. \"It would help if we could all go\r\nat once you know,\" he muttered a bit loudly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it would, wouldn't it?\" Kai replied before the technicians could respond.\r\n\"It's just your luck that the other launch units are being serviced today. Don't\r\nworry, you'll be launched right after her.\" Laguna, Mecis and another SeeD were\r\nbeing assigned to guard duty at the orbiting Lunar Base, and Kai was there to\r\nsee them off.\r\n\r\nLaguna ignored him and turned to Mecis. \"You'll be fine, okay, I'll be there\r\nright after you.\"\r\n\r\nMecis smiled back at him, \"Don't worry about me.\"\r\n\r\nLaguna smiled as well. Stepping down, he closed the hatch and moved away.\r\n\r\n\"Launch error correction, plus 2. Orbital correction, minus 1. Corrections\r\ncomplete. Commencing launch...\" the technicians powered up the launch unit,\r\n\"3...2...1...go!\"\r\n\r\nFor the second time in his life, Laguna witnessed the powerful force of the\r\nlunar launch unit. Acting as a magic-enhanced catapult, the device propelled\r\nMecis' Launch capsule upwards at a precalclated angle, going at more than twice\r\nthe escape velocity. The launch generated a powerful wake, and it was several\r\nseconds before Laguna noticed Kai had said something to him.\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Laguna said to the senior SeeD even as his hearing recovered from the\r\nmomentary shock.\r\n\r\n\"I said,\" Kai repeated, \"This is gonna be the last mission for the two of you,\r\nisn't it?\"\r\n\r\nLaguna said nothing and looked up at Mecis' capsule.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nEverything flashed by.\r\n\r\nShe felt a bump. Then another. And another. She started to regain her senses,\r\nand Mecis felt slightly queasy. \"Why did I agree to this?\" she thought ruefully\r\nto herself. The hibernation process initiated at the Lunar Gate prevented her\r\nfrom moving around, but she was still flly conscious. Finally gathering enough\r\nstrength to look around, she glanced out the transparent glass hull of her Lunar\r\nCapsule. Everything was still moving too fast.\r\n\r\nAnother bump rocked the capsule, and she realized that the bumps were being\r\ncaused by large energy nets that served to slow the capsule's momentum as it\r\nhurtled towards the Lunar Base. Another bump, then another. After one more bump,\r\nshe realzed the capsule's speed was relatively slower now, and that it was in\r\nfact about to come to a halt.\r\n\r\nLooking outside, she saw the Lunar Base, a massive space station set into orbit\r\nby the Esthar government more than a hundred years ago. \"Amazing,\" she said to\r\nherself, \"It's larger than I thought.\"\r\n\r\nFour figures dressed in white appeared around her capsule. \"Astronauts,\" Mecis\r\nrealized, as the four figures started to bring her capsule towards the space\r\nstation. They loaded her capsule into a large machine, some sort of relay device\r\napparently. The device carted her capsule into the Lunar Base's Dock Area.\r\n\r\nShe felt a few more bumps, and the next thing she knew, she was inside a large\r\nhangar-like structure. She heard a faint voice over the transceiver on the\r\ncapsule.\r\n\r\n\"Initiating quick thaw.\"\r\n\r\nWith relief, Mecis felt the temperature around her start to increase. Slowly,\r\nthe numbess vanished from her body, and she was able to move. The capsule hatch\r\nopened, and she started to step out. As she looked around, she was surprised to\r\nsee her capsule was suspended off a wall roughly ten meters off the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry,\" she heard a voice, \"Gravity's off.\"\r\n\r\nMecis recognized the voice as belonging to Rez, the other SeeD she had met at\r\nthe mission briefing. Turnin towards him, she saw him floating around,\r\nsurrounded by several more astronauts.\r\n\r\n\"You okay?\" Rez asked her. He was a tall, blond-haired guy, probably no more\r\nthan 20 years old. Mecis didn't know much about him, except that he was from\r\nGalbadia and that they would be working together at the Lunar Base for the next\r\nthree months.\r\n\r\nMecis nodded. \"Just a bit woozy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't go seasick now.\" Rez said cautiously. Mecis smarted at the comment. Kai\r\nknew she was conscious about her travel sickness, but went ahead and mentioned\r\nit on the way to Lunar Gate anyway. \"I'm so gonna smack him when we get back,\"\r\nshe thought to herself.\r\n\r\nShe stepped out of the capsule, and felt herself floating in mid-air. \"It's like\r\na Float spell,\" she thought to herself. She recovered her duffel bag from the\r\ncapsule and floated towards Rez and the astronauts.\r\n\r\n\"What's with the luggage?\" Mecis asked Rez. Rez was carrying not only the\r\nstandard SeeD duffel bag, but also an additional backpack he wore over his\r\nshoulder. It was unusual for SeeDs to carry more than the duffel bag during\r\nmissions.\r\n\r\nRez shrugged. \"I'm a heavy packer.\"\r\n\r\nMecis was about to reply when one of the astronauts spoke. \"Third capsule\r\nincoming.\"\r\n\r\n\"Looks like your boyfriend's coming in.\" Rez commented. Mecis didn't answer and\r\njust looked out the transparent glass walls of the hangar. She saw another Lunar\r\nCapsule come in from the distance, and row upon row of vibrant energy nets\r\nappeared in front of it. As the Capsule hit each net, it lost a bit of speed,\r\nuntil if finally slowed to a crawl. The four astronauts loaded the capsule into\r\nthe waiting relay machine, and she saw how the machine manuevered the capsule\r\ninto a nearby tube. The capsule shot out and reappeared near where her own\r\ncapsule was.\r\n\r\n\"Initiating quick thaw.\" Mecis realized the voice was coming over a loudspeaker.\r\nShe saw Laguna's capsule glow momentarily before the hatch opened. Laguna\r\nstepped out, dragging his bag behind him. Unlike Mecis, he quickly adapted to\r\nthe zero-gravity condition and immediately went over to her.\r\n\r\n\"You okay?\" Laguna said to her. Mecis detected a bit of fatigue in his voice and\r\nreplied. \"I'm fine. You look like that trip shook you a bit.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I just need a bit of sleep that's all.\"\r\n\r\nMecis smiled at his reply. Laguna would never admit to being shaken by anything.\r\n\r\nThey heard Rez call out to them. \"If you lovebirds are ready, we gotta go see\r\nthe director.\" He was already being escorted by a couple of astronauts towards a\r\nnearby doorway. A couple more astronauts moved towards the pair, motioning them\r\nto follow.\r\n\r\n\"Let's go,\" Laguna said to Mecis. The astronauts guided them to the doorway and\r\ninto another room. The door shut behind them, and the astronauts slowly moved\r\nthem towards the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Locking gravity.\" The same voice spoke over the loudspeaker. Mecis felt a\r\nfeeling of weightedness start to appear around her, similar to how a Float spell\r\nwore off. She and the others gently landed on the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Gravity lock complete. Welcome to Esthar Lunar Base.\" The door on the other\r\nside of the hallway opened and the astronauts motioned them towards it. The\r\nvoice spoke again, \"Please follow the right-hand corridor to report to the\r\nDirector. Thank you.\"\r\n\r\nThe three SeeDs stepped out into the corridor. It opened into three paths, one\r\nheading left, one heading right, and a stairway goind up. \"Well, time waits for\r\nno one,\" Rez said as he went down the right-hand hallway. Laguna and Mecis\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n\"Check it out!\"\r\n\r\nMecis was looking out the large glass window in the hallway. The window provided\r\na clear view of the surrounding space. At a slight distance from the space\r\nstation, there was a huge circular structure that seemed to be filled with some\r\nsort of translucent crystal. A humanoid figrue dressed in blue could be seen\r\ninside the structure.\r\n\r\n\"Man, you get amazed easily, don't you?\" Rez needled her, \"That's Rinoa's Tomb.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what it is!\" Mecis shot back, slightly annoyed. Rinoa's Tomb was the\r\nreason the Esthar Lunar Base was built. Rinoa Heartily, the last sorceress in\r\nhistorical record, was being kept in suspended animation within the crystal\r\nprison. Shortly after participating alongside SeeD in the last Sorceress War,\r\nshe was struck with a fatal disease that was impossible to recover from. Fearing\r\nthat her death would cause her powers to be passed on to a new, more powerful\r\nsorceress, she had willfully succumbed to the suspension process. And she had\r\nremained in this same place for the last hundred years, a grim reminder of the\r\ndanger posed to the world by the sorceress powers. And a grim reminder of why\r\nSeeD's vigilance was needed at all times. She had seen pictures of it before of\r\ncourse, but the view from this close was completely different. One could see\r\ncompletely into the crystal prison, and Mecis could almost see the expression on\r\nher face.\r\n\r\n\"She seems so...sad.\", Mecis said.\r\n\r\n\"Sad? What are you talking about? She's a sorceress!\" Rez retorted.\r\n\r\n\"That's not what I'm talking about!\" Mecis replied. \"Rumor has it that her lover\r\nwas a SeeD!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please, that's just an urban legend.\" Rez said. \"Why would a SeeD become\r\ninvolved with a sorceress?\"\r\n\r\nLaguna, having had enough of their witty reparte, nudged Mecis. \"Come on, the\r\ndirector's waiting.\"\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\n\"Just three of you this time? Garden's getting overconfident aren't they?\" Dr.\r\nKasim was the head of the Lunar Base staff and director of the Sorceress\r\nResearch project. \"Or are they too busy fighting other people's wars?\"\r\n\r\nMecis seethed at the insult. Ever since the last Sorceress had been defeated,\r\nSeeD had made a name for itself as a powerful mercenary force. The current head\r\nof Garden, Cid IV had justified it by saying Garden needed the money to maintain\r\nit's vigilance against the Sorceresses. This, along with SeeD's tendency to\r\nunfairly prosecute suspected potential Sorceresses had considerably dimmed\r\nSeeD's reputation worldwide.\r\n\r\n\"That was an unnecessary comme-\" Mecis was cut off as Laguna nudged her.\r\n\r\nLaguna saluted the director and spoke. \"Sir, with all due respect, three SeeDs\r\nare more than enough to handle any threat that may appear, and Garden's\r\npeacekeeping operations are all geared towards protecting the peace of the\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, whatever.\" The director looked over the assignment sheet Laguna had\r\nhanded him. \"Laguna Hilmark. Named after the former president eh?\" Laguna simply\r\nnodded. The director picked up a metallic card from his desk and tossed it to\r\nLaguna.\r\n\r\n\"That's the pass for your quarters, take the elevator further down the hall to\r\nsub-level III. Dismissed.\"\r\n\r\nLaguna saluted again, and all three SeeDs filed out of the director's room.\r\n\r\n\"Nice guy,\" Rez muttered, \"I'm so gonna enjoy working for him...NOT!\"\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThe door to the SeeD quarters slid open, and the three of them stepped inside.\r\n\r\n\"Two rooms huh,\" Rez said, looking around, \"Will it be guys and girl, or will\r\nyou two be sharing a room?\" He grinned at the two mischievously. Laguna shot him\r\na hard look.\r\n\r\n\"Heh, you said the wrong thing.\" Mecis said.\r\n\r\n\"Garden Code Article 45 Paragraph 12.\" Laguna recited in a monotone. \"SeeD\r\nmembers are forbidden from having relations while on duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sheesh, you're really anal about the rules, aren't you?\" Rez said, \"Lighten\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"I call this room!\" Mecis said, entering the bigger bedroom. She put down her\r\nduffel bag and started to unpack.\r\n\r\nLaguna shrugged. He went into the other room. It had two bunker-style beds,\r\nsimilar to those in Garde dormitories. Rez followed, tossed his bags unto the\r\ntop bed and walked out.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" Laguna asked him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm gonna go take a look around.\" Rez said casually as he walked out of the\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\n\"Don't get into any trouble,\" Laguna called after him as he went on unpacking.\r\n\r\nMecis stepped into their room after Rez walked out. \"Isn't he tired? He's okay\r\nthough, isn't he?\"\r\n\r\nLaguna looked up at her. \"Yeah, I guess. He's a bit weird though.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've worked with him before, during the Timber mission. \"\r\n\r\n\"Against the Forest Owls?\" Mecis had heard the story from Laguna before. The\r\nForest Owls were a revolutionary group led by pro-Sorceress fanatics. Laguna had\r\nbeen assigned there a year ago to defend Timber after a potential Sorceress was\r\nrumored to have been found in that area.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah,\" Laguna nodded, \"He was kind of a loner and was really quiet, like he\r\ndidn't like what was going on.\"\r\n\r\nMecis shrugged. \"He seems fine to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you should get used to him, we'll all be working together for the next\r\nthree months.\"\r\n\r\n\"Laguna...\"\r\n\r\nLaguna hesitated before asking. \"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"After this mission, are we--?\"\r\n\r\nLaguna sighed. Mecis had wanted to retire from SeeD after this mission. While\r\nshe was a tough girl, she was physically weak compared to other SeeDs, which was\r\nwhy she had preferred to take administrative functions during her tour of duty.\r\nShe was tired of her and Laguna constantly being in danger because they were\r\nSeeDs, and had wanted to start a peaceful life in her hometown of Winhill.\r\n\"Didn't the Headmaster at Trabia invite you to be an instructor?\" Laguna said to\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, but...I dunno. I'd still be a SeeD.\" Even as an instructor, SeeDs could\r\nbe called to combat duty at any time if needed. Mecis sighed, \"Do you still want\r\nto--?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just that if we quit,\" Laguna replied, \"then what would I do?\"\r\n\r\nMecis smiled. \"You could be something ordinary. Like a barber!\"\r\n\r\nLaguna shook his head. \"You're being silly. Tell you what. Let's wait 'til this\r\nmission is over. After this one, we'll go on vacation, and we'll decide then,\r\nokay?\"\r\n\r\nMecis smiled at him again. A vacation was better than nothing. \"Okay.\"\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nKai was walking down a hallway in the Tears Point research facility, several\r\nkilometers from the Lunar Gate. He stopped at a door marked \"Lunar Observation\r\nControl\" and made his way in.\r\n\r\nThe room was a large array of computers and monitors. Several heads craned to\r\nlook at him when he entered, and all but one went back to their work after they\r\ndid not recognize him. Sienna Balmont, commander of SeeD's Dincht division\r\nresponsible for Esthar, nodded to him. \"Did the launch go well?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nKai nodded back. \"They're fine. They should be resting up at the Lunar Base by\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, they're going to need that rest,\" Sienna muttered.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Readings here indicate unusual activity on the surface of the moon over the\r\npast few weeks. The 'residents' of the moon seem to be converging on a\r\nparticular spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--?\" Kai was surprised at what she was implying.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Apparently, the time has come for another Lunar Cry.\"\r\n\r\n-----------------------\r\nTBC\r\n\r\nAuthor's Rants:\r\nWell, this is the first time I'll be doing a multi-part 'fic, so wish me luck!\r\nAnyway, I know nothing much happened in this part, but I just wanted to lay the\r\ngroundwork for some future events. I wanted to include the first major plot\r\nevent in this one, but after writing the above, I felt it would be a bit too\r\nlong, so I'll just cut it here. Between the cheesy title and the happenings\r\nhere, can you guess what this 'fic will be about? Stay tuned.\r\nOn a side note, if FF8 is my least favorite FF game, why am I writing about it?\r\nIt's because the story was so weak I have to supplement it myself, lol. No\r\noffense to FF8-lovers. =)\r\nAs always, any comments, corrections, suggestions, e-mail me. Flames, send 'em\r\nto bill@microsoft.com.\r\n",

However,\r\nthis does not forgive the fact that your actions before, during and after\r\nthe Ultimecia incident not to mention your allowing yourself to fall under\r\nher influence speak towards your lack of discipline and lack of respect\r\ntowards the institutions of Garden.

Quistis, Zell, Selphie, Rinoa and Irvine had come to see him off.\r\n\"We all know the decision was already made even before I came back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Seifer...\" Rinoa said.\r\n\r\n\"Where's Squall? Doesn't he want to gloat at me a bit before I get going?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seifer,\" Quistis said, \"I think you grossly underestimate how everyone\r\nfeels about you.\" Zell started to make a comment but Selphie quickly\r\nelbowed him in the gut.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah whatever,\" Seifer said, picking up his duffel bag. \"I'm off.\" He\r\nstepped out of the dormitory hallway and made his way to the exit. Not one\r\nof the others could follow after him.\r\n\r\nAs Seifer turned the corner towards the exit, he heard a voice behind him.\r\n\"Hey.\" Seifer turned around to see Squall leaning against the Garden\r\ndirectory.\r\n\r\n\"What, you come to laugh at me or something?\" Seifer said.\r\n\r\nSquall traced a line across his forehead scar with his forefinger.\r\n\"I still owe you. Don't die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hmph,\" Seifer said and he walked off.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\"Seifer wait up!\"\r\n\r\nSeifer looked at the two figures running towards him. \"Raijin, Fujin,\"\r\nSeifer said, \"What do you guys want?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, you were just gonna leave without us?\" Raijin said.\r\n\r\n\"EXPLAIN.\" Fujin said. It was a command, not a request.\r\n\r\n\"I convinced them I forced you both to do what I said.\" Seifer replied.\r\n\"You guys get to stay. I'm the only one who has to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are you talkin' about Seifer?\" Raijin said, \"We're a posse, we can't\r\nbe split now, y'know.\"\r\n\r\n\"You two still have a chance to take the SeeD test next year,\" Seifer said,\r\n\"Don't screw up your lives on my account.\"\r\n\r\n\"IDIOT.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wha--?\" Raijin was caught unawares. As far as he knew, Fujin had never\r\ninsulted Seifer before.\r\n\r\n\"What did you say Fujin?\" Seifer said, surprised.\r\n\r\n\"Idiot. You think we didn't know what we were doing?\" Fujin said, her tone\r\nof voice different. \"We knew we'd get in trouble, yet we stuck by you. Now\r\nyou just want to leave us behind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Heh.\" Seifer's face formed into his usual sneer. \"I should've known.\r\nAlright, gather your stuff, and meet me at Balamb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alright,\" Raijin said, \"Where we goin, Seifer? Galbadia? Esthar?\"\r\n\r\nSeifer looked up for a bit before responding. \"I think we'll go fishing.\"\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nZell rushed into the room. \"Hey guys, turn it to channel 31.\"\r\n\r\n\"Channel 31?

A scene near a train station was being shown, and the field\r\nreporter's voice came through.\r\n\r\n\"...the situation was resolved when three unidentified mercenaries came in\r\nand brought the Galbadian president to safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercenaries?\" A different voice spoke, probably the news anchor at the\r\nstation. \"You mean SeeD?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, the authorities say they were definitely not SeeD.

Standard disclaimers\r\napply. Spoilers? Not really...\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI'm almost there.\r\n\r\nI must've been walking for a day and a half now. A day and a half through\r\nsnow-filled forests and mountains, barely eating. I haven't slept since that\r\nship dropped me off on this island. I'm tired and exhausted. But I need to get\r\nthere. I have to.\r\n\r\nThe others--they don't understand. None of them understand. They tried to stop\r\nme, to hold me back. You don't need it, they said. How could they know? They\r\nknow what it's like. The feeling of strength, the feeling of power, the rush of\r\nadrenaline that I get. I need that rush. I want it.\r\n\r\nThere it is! I'm finally here, after all that walking. The dome-like structure\r\nstands out among the surrounding snow, like an out-of-place metal igloo. My goal\r\nis here, I'm mere steps away. I quicken my pace.\r\n\r\nIn front of the dome, three figures stand. Barely four feet tall, they are\r\nobviously not human. Yellow-skinned humanoids, Shumi. These three are the ones I\r\nseek. They're the only ones now between my goal and me. As I approach, they\r\nglance at me before once again assuming their ready stances. They know what they\r\nguard is valuable.\r\n\r\nI bring out my purse, hoping I have enough money. It's the last of my cash, the\r\nlast of my supplies. It's not even my money, I had to swipe it from Rinoa. It's\r\nnot like she needs it, her dad's well off anyway. What I need is more important.\r\n\r\nThe Shumi nod at me, and I toss the purse at them. They look over the purse,\r\nthen turn to look to each other. What? Not enough? No, please. I need to have\r\nit. Come on... I'll pay you back the rest later, I tell them.\r\n\r\nThey shake their heads. Sorry. Sorry? Sorry won't do. I need to have that power,\r\nthat rush. My own supply ran out days ago. I need a fix, and I need it bad. They\r\nshake their heads once more, and ask me to leave. But I can't leave. I need that\r\nrush.\r\n\r\nBefore I know it, the gunblade is in my hand. The Shumi, they're sturdy people,\r\nand some are known to be fierce warriors. But they haven't faced the battles\r\nI've faced. And of course they weren't expecting it.\r\n\r\nThe first guard explodes into white blood before the other two can react. They\r\ndraw their weapons, I stare them down. They know they're going to die. Fools.\r\nThey should've just given me what I wanted. One of them charges, the other runs\r\nfor the nearby dome entrance, hoping to sound an alarm. The second one dies\r\nquickly, the gunblade going through his throat. Before his body even falls to\r\nthe ground, a low ringing sound begins to echo around the structure. The other\r\nguard was quicker than I thought. As I turned, he was already on top of me,\r\nblade ready.\r\n\r\nNot that he would have gotten me. Not in a hundred years. He barely has time to\r\nshout a death cry.\r\n\r\nThe guards are down. The alarm is sounding. But it doesn't matter. My goal is\r\nhere, mere steps away. It'll take them several minutes to get up here, and by\r\nthen it'll be mine.\r\n\r\nI walk to the bright patch of snow the Shumi were guarding and lean down,\r\nlooking for that sensitive spot. There! There it is! Finally! It's been so long.\r\n\r\nSweating slightly, I close my eyes and focus on the goal. I can feel it there.\r\nThat power. That rush. I reach out with my mind, and take it for myself.\r\n\r\nYes! An incredible rush comes over me, too much for me to handle. I fall over\r\nfrom the shock. I can feel it come over me, overwhelming me with unbelievable\r\nforce. It fills my body and soul, flowing through my veins, invigorating every\r\ncell of my body. God, yes! This is what I live for, this power, this\r\noverwhelming power.\r\n\r\nThe rush passes, all too quickly. More, I need more. As I reach down to draw\r\nmore of that power, the gate of the dome opens, and five Shumi warriors come\r\nout, determined looks on their faces. I smile and reach out my hand to them.\r\n\r\nTheir eyes widen in fear as they realize what is about to happen. But it's too\r\nlate. I feel the power flow through me again. Outwards this time, another\r\nincredible rush, though not as good as the first one. I feel the energy course\r\nthrough my veins, flowing out my outstretched arm.\r\n\r\nThe Shumi don't have time to think. They move to scatter, but they are slow, too\r\nslow. Before they can take a single step, a scintillating white light, with the\r\nfaintest hint of green appears around them, surrounding them, bathing them in a\r\npure white glow that makes the surrounding snow look like an oil slick. Their\r\nfaces recoil in fear, and the white glow seems to pulse for an infinite time,\r\nbefore finally exploding into a thousand brilliant shards of pearl and emerald.\r\nThe glow settles, and there is nothing left. Not even a trace.\r\n\r\nNow free of distractions, I reach down and continue to extract more of that\r\npower. That sweet, flowing power. I look around, seeing the carnage I had\r\ncaused, and I realize that they were all right after all.\r\n\r\nMy name is Squall Leonhart.\r\n\r\nAnd I am an Ultima junkie.\r\n\r\n-fin-\r\n\r\nAuthor's rants: \"What? Squall would never do anything like that! That's totally\r\nOOC!\" Maybe, maybe not, I don't know. What I do know is that obsession and\r\naddiction can bring out the worst in the best of us. And the worst about Squall\r\nis that he would willfully place the lives of millions in danger to get what he\r\nwants. I'm glad I have no such additions. Well, maybe to video games, maybe. Not\r\nthat I'd kill anyone over a video game, of course. This one was a quickie, done\r\nin no more than thirty minutes, twenty even. I just thought about it while\r\nwatching someone play FF8. He kept going back to that draw point every so often\r\nI said \"It's like you're addicted to it.\" Totally spur-of-the-moment.\r\n\r\nOh yeah, I was just watching THE WEAKEST LINK (yeah all caps), so here's a\r\nlittle something extra:\r\n\r\nNida: \"Quistis, why Zell?\"\r\n\r\nQuistis: (shakes head) \"I'm ashamed to say I was his teacher. He flubbed so many\r\neasy questions. Like the one about Hyne...\"\r\n\r\nNida: \"What about you, you've been to FH, haven't you?\"\r\n\r\nQuistis: \"Well... yes.\"\r\n\r\nNida: \"How come you didn't know the name of the mayor there?\"\r\n\r\nQuistis: \"Well, that's... not exactly Garden curriculum...\"\r\n\r\nNida: \"Rinoa, why Zell?\"\r\n\r\nRinoa: \"Well, he seems to take so long to answer, and he got a lot of wrong\r\nanswers, so...\" (shrugs)\r\n\r\nNida: \"You have a boyfriend, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nRinoa: (embarassed) \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nNida: \"Don't you go out on dates?\"\r\n\r\nRinoa: \"We do...\"\r\n\r\nNida: \"Then how come you don't know the meaning of 'foot the bill'? Doesn't he\r\npay for your meals?\"\r\n\r\nRinoa: \"Well... he...\"\r\n\r\nSquall: (puts his palm to his forehead)\r\n\r\nRinoa: (embarrassed) \"He doesn't earn much, so we always go Dutch.\"\r\n\r\nNida: \"How cheap!\"\r\n\r\nSquall: \"...Whatever.\"\r\n\r\nNida: (turns to Zell) \"Zell, according to our statistics you are not the weakest\r\nlink. However, with four votes, you are THE WEAKEST LINK. Goodbye.\"",

Standard disclaimers apply.\r\nFinal Fantasy IX spoilers, all the way baby!\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nMy name is Vivi Ornitier.\r\n\r\nI am a black mage.\r\n\r\nThat is to say, I can call upon elemental forces to weave powerful magical\r\nspells of destruction. Which is often quite handy, especially when facing a\r\nlarge group of plant-like creatures that can tear me apart with their limbs or\r\npetrify me with a single drop of their saliva.\r\n\r\nA simple flick of my wrist and a small burst of concentration is all it takes,\r\nand three of the plant-creatures explode into ice shards. Six more appear to\r\nreplace the fallen ones. I had hoped I would never have to use these powers\r\nagain. Fate seemed to have a different opinion.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nDenial.\r\n\r\nFreya walked silently along the street of Treno. She wouldn't be able to come\r\nback here for a while, with all the events over in Burmecia. So she wanted to\r\ntake one last stroll before she took the ride to Lindblum. The moon cast a pale\r\nglow over Treno at this time of day. Strange that for a city that never\r\nsleeps, it looks its brightest when the moon is full.\r\n\r\nFreya stopped at the stairway leading to the street near Dr. Tot's house. A lone\r\nfigure was sitting at the landing on top of walkway. Recognizing the hat, Freya\r\nwalked up and sat down beside him.\r\n\r\n\"Hey, what's wrong?\"\r\n\r\nThe figure gave a start, apparently noticing Freya for the first time.\r\n\"Oh... I... well... it's nothing, I guess...\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you visit Dr. Tot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Y-yeah. He wanted to see me that's all.\"\r\n\r\n\"You sure there's nothing wrong?\" Freya made a worried face at her friend. \"I've\r\nbeen hearing some rumors from the village.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I... it's nothing.\" He got up. \"Sorry, I promised Eiko I'd teach her how to\r\nbid at the auction today.\"\r\n\r\nFreya nodded, and the little guy ran off with his unusual stride. A faint\r\nscreeching sound echoed in the distance and Freya recognized it as the familiar\r\nhum of the railway cars.\r\n\r\n\"Guess that's my ride,\" she said to no one in particular.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\"Vivi, behind you!\" The voice belonged to Blank, one of the Tantalus Crew. He's\r\na nice guy, always looking out for other people. It's a good thing he's looking\r\nout for me right now, as I spin around to see a giant green tentacle about to\r\nslam down on me. As he jumped up to take on the offending vegetable, I threw a\r\nquick bolt of lightning at his sword, and his enchanted blade took the target\r\ndown in one blow.\r\n\r\nI hate fighting, but I'm glad I decided to come along with the Tantalus. Back\r\nhere, to where it all began. For me and my brothers at least, although we can't\r\nsay we were born here, this is where our souls came from. The excuses we have\r\nfor souls at least.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, we're almost there!\" That's Marcus, another one of the Tantalus Crew.\r\nI pointed a finger, and a large ball of flame exploded against the plant walls\r\nbefore us, opening the way deeper into the maze of plant-life that was the Iifa\r\nTree. Or what remained of it anyway.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nBargaining.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at the avian doctor. He knew it would come eventually, but to hear\r\nsomeone say it was an entirely different matter all together.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor Tot...are you sure...\" His high-pitched voice trailed off. \"There must\r\nbe something you can do.\"\r\n\r\nDoctor Tot sighed. He always hated to be the bearer of bad news. He adjusted his\r\nspectacles and looked at the young man with sadness in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry...I'll conduct some more tests with the samples I took but... I can't\r\npromise anything.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the other tests? Didn't you find anything?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't had enough time to complete the other tests, I'm afraid...\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor... please...\" Tot could here the desperation in his voice. \"There has to\r\nbe something...\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry. We all knew this would happen, sooner or later.\"\r\n\r\n\"No... This can't be... not now... I...\" He couldn't find the strength to gather\r\nhis thoughts. \"I'm sorry Doctor.\" He ran off without another word.\r\n\r\nDoctor Tot closed his eyes, adjusted his spectacles and grimaced. He hated being\r\nthe bearer of bad news.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nAnother wall breaks down, and we rush forward, stopping suddenly at the edge of\r\nwhat seemed to be a deep semicircular crevice with walls made of green foliage.\r\nAs if on cue, twigs, branches and leaves gave way inside the crevice, revealing\r\nnumerous spider-like plant-creatures, the same ones we'd encountered before.\r\n\r\nThe Tantalus Crew almost cringed at the sight of these hordes, but their\r\nattention was drawn by Marcus' outstretched hand. \"Over there!\"\r\n\r\nNear the center of the crevice, two human like figures lay on the ground,\r\nunmoving, and right at the base of the Iifa Tree. Without hesitation, we make\r\nour way across the valley of beasts. I provide covering fire as Blank and Cinna\r\nmake their way toward the two figures.\r\n\r\n\"Just as I thought,\" Blank says, \"It's the same thing as the petrified forest.\"\r\n\r\nCinna inspects the first body. \"This one's dead. Looks like he's been this way\r\nfor weeks.\" Marcus and I turn to look at the body, and heave a sigh of relief\r\nwhen it's not the one we're looking for.\r\n\r\n\"Must've been Kuja. Poor sap,\" Blank said. But our attention was already held by\r\nthe other figure, a somewhat short humanoid form, encased in stone.\r\n\r\n\"Zidane.\" I manage to say.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nAnger.\r\n\r\n\"Ouch!\"\r\n\r\nEiko had been one her way to Doctor Tot's residence when she collided with a\r\nsmall figure apparently in a hurry. Apparently, the other one was as surprised\r\nas she was, as both of them were knocked back a bit by the collision.\r\n\r\n\"Watch where you're--\" Eiko looked at the one she had bumped into. \"Vivi?\"\r\n\r\nVivi dusted himself off and looked at the young summoner. \"Oh, hi Eiko. Excuse\r\nme, I--\"\r\n\r\n\"Hey!\" Eiko said, grabbing Vivi's arm before he could dash off, \"Where do you\r\nthink you're going? I've been looking all over for you! You made me wait up at\r\nthe auc--\"\r\n\r\nEiko was surprised to be cut off as Vivi shook off her hand. \"Sorry, Eiko, but I\r\ndon't have time for this right now, okay?\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Is there a problem? Some sort of emergency?\"\r\n\r\n\"Problem? Of course not!\" Eiko was astonished to hear a hint of sarcasm in\r\nVivi's voice, a tone she'd never heard from the black mage before. \"The world is\r\nsafe remember? We went out and saved the world! Why should there be a problem?\"\r\n\r\n\"Vivi, what are you--?\"\r\n\r\n\"We went all the way to a different world, faced the spirit of destruction, and\r\nthat... that monkey Kuja is dead!\" Vivi's voice was completely different from his\r\nusual shy tone, even though his featureless face revealed nothing. \"Everything\r\nshould be great! Everyone should be happy!\" Vivi shook his hands around him in\r\nfrustration. Eiko noticed sparks starting to form around her erstwhile friend.\r\nPeople had started to stop and stare at the ranting little boy.\r\n\r\n\"Vivi, I think you should calm down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Calm down? Look at what's happened to us! The princess hasn't spoken to anyone\r\nsince Zidane...\" Vivi's voice trailed off, \"And now I...I...\" Tendrils of energy\r\nstarted to twirl around his cone-shaped hat, totally unnoticed by the now\r\nranting mage. \"We went out and gave everything for everyone! It shouldn't be\r\nlike this!\" The ground around Vivi suddenly burst into an explosion of flames.\r\n\r\n\"Aaah!!!\" Eiko was knocked off her feet and was thrown to the nearby wall.\r\n\"Ou--ch!!!\" The nearby townspeople were forced back by the sudden blaze. Despite\r\nall the events that had happened lately, exploding flames were never a good\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nVivi stopped and noticed the flames swirling around him. \"Wha--? Oh no!\" He\r\nturned to see a slightly scorched Eiko trying to stand up. He looked down at his\r\nown hands to see traces of the flames still lingering on his gloves. \"Eiko, I--\"\r\nNot knowing what to say, Vivi ran off.\r\n\r\nEiko heard footsteps behind her and turned to see Doctor Tot approaching from\r\nhis residence. The doctor adjusted his spectacles, and turned to help Eiko get\r\nup. \"What happened here?\"\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nWe're running now, as hard and as fast as we can. As soon as the Supersoft had\r\ntaken effect, a large bulbous head had appeared from the Iifa Tree, as if\r\ndefending it's home from a robbery. Marcus had taken the unconscious Zidane over\r\nhis shoulders, and we made our way back to daylight. By the time we reached the\r\nTantalus, I was exhausted, and nearly drained of my power. The Benero brothers\r\nwaved us on board, and the engines roared to life.\r\n\r\nRight behind us however, the mass of tentacles at the base of the Iifa Tree\r\nstarted to move. They shot out, with the bulbous head just behind them, as if\r\nordering them to prevent our escape. I drew upon my last remaining reserves and\r\ntried to hold them off.\r\n\r\nBaku ordered the liftoff, and the Tantalus took to the air. Three tentacles shot\r\nout, two of them latching onto the Tantalus' bow, the other onto the tail. More\r\ntentacles came out as the ship was swung around.\r\n\r\nBaku came out armed now, \"The ship'll break apart if this goes on!\"\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nDespair.\r\n\r\nAmarant nodded grimly to the guard as the gate closed behind him. He hefted his\r\npack over his left shoulder, and looked towards the station. The night was\r\nyoung, and he had a long way to go.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Amarant?\"\r\n\r\nAmarant turned around at the high-pitched voice. It's the kid, he thought to\r\nhimself. The \"kid\" was seated on a small knoll just outside of the Treno city\r\ngate. Judging from the dew gathering around his hat, he'd been there for a\r\nwhile.\r\n\r\n\"Are you leaving too?\" He heard the kid say the words, but he couldn't see how\r\nhe spoke. Not that it mattered. Amarant was never one to try to figure\r\neverything out.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. I still got some 'unfinished business' elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh. I see. Everyone's leaving then...\" The kid's voice trailed off with a\r\nfamiliar tone.\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. You're the last one left. Still got business with the doc?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well... I...\" His bright eyes seemed to affix themselves to the ground.\r\n\r\nAmarant grunted. \"Guess what the brat told me was true, huh?\"\r\n\r\n\"B-brat?\" The kid looked up, \"You mean Eiko?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah. She kept pestering me about cheerin' you up.\" Amarant turned to go. \"Not\r\nthat I care, mind you.\"\r\n\r\n\"...\"\r\n\r\nAmarant took a couple of steps, then, as if changing his mind, stopped in\r\nmid-stride. \"You wanna live forever, kid?\"\r\n\r\n\"W-what?\"\r\n\r\nAmarant went on without turning around. \"Everybody goes sometime you know.\r\nYou're luckier than most, 'coz you know when to expect it. But people like me,\r\nthat brat, even that goof-off knight or that guard by the gate, we have no idea.\r\nWe could be dead tomorrow for all we know.\"\r\n\r\n\"M-Mr. Amarant...\"\r\n\r\n\"But you don't see us sittin' on a hill wonderin' why we gotta die, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I...\"\r\n\r\n\"If you think sitting there feeling sorry for yourself is the best you can do,\r\ngo ahead. But the rest of us, we go ahead, and do whatever it is we do, even if\r\nwe die the next day. I don't know what you believe in, but that's gotta be\r\nbetter than moping around.\" Amarant started to walk off again. \"'Sides kid,\r\nnobody wants to live forever.\"\r\n\r\nVivi looked at Amarant's departing figure and considered the mercenary's words.\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nBlank shouted something to his companions as he tried to keep the ship steady. I\r\ncouldn't hear above the noise of the battle. Baku, Marcus and Cinna came\r\nforward. Cinna took the helm, and the others tried to hack off the offending\r\nplants. It was no use however, we couldn't break free. It seemed like the more\r\nwe fought, the more tentacles appeared. And we were too tired to go on.\r\n\r\nZidane, awakened by the violent assault, got to his feet groggily. \"What's going\r\non?\" he asked as he held on to Cinna for balance. Cinna told him to stay down,\r\nbut Zidane, quickly taking stock of the situation, drew a dagger from Cinna's\r\nbelt. \"I'm not gonna go without a fight,\" he said, \"If Tantalus goes down, we\r\nall go down!\"\r\n\r\nDown below, the giant bulbous head looked up at us, as if taunting us. \"There is\r\nno escape.\"\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nAcceptance.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think you should come with us, little guy.\" Baku looked down at the\r\nsmall figure beside him as the crew loaded their gear unto his ship.\r\n\r\n\"B-but, Mr. Baku...I really want to help.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that, kid, but...it's a Tantalus thing, you know?\" Baku smiled grimly.\r\n\"We're the ones who gotta go after that idiot.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's up Boss?\" Blank walked up to the pair, slightly sweaty from the day's\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\"Don't what's up me, how's the loading?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's fine. Everything oughta be finished by dusk. Heya Vivi.\"\r\n\r\nThe diminutive black mage nodded, adjusted his hat, and decided to convince\r\nBlank instead. \"Please let me come with you Blank!\"\r\n\r\n\"What? It's gonna be pretty dangerous, y'know.\" Blank said, as if uncertain.\r\n\r\n\"That's what I keep tellin' the kid,\" Baku agreed, before going to look over the\r\nloading process.\r\n\r\nBlank turned to Vivi. \"You really want to find him don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Please Blank, it's the least I can do for him,\" Vivi pleaded. \"He's done so\r\nmuch for me, for all of us! I, I--\"\r\n\r\nBlank smiled and crouched down beside the black mage. \"To be honest, I don't\r\nthink we can do it by ourselves.\" He looked over at Baku's hulking form. \"Didn't\r\nwant to mention it in front of the boss, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then will you--?\"\r\n\r\nBlank shook his head, and Vivi's eyes showed signs of disappointment. \"The\r\nBoss'd never agree. Sorry Vivi, gotta keep packin'. See those crates over\r\nthere.\" Vivi looked over to where he pointed and saw several large wooden\r\ncrates. \"I still gotta load those, but I don't know why we're usin' such large\r\ncrates.\" He smiled at Vivi again. \"Probably enough space in those crates to fit\r\na small person, you know what I mean?\"\r\n\r\nVivi looked up, a surprised look in his eyes, and nodded gratefully.\r\n\r\nBlank stood up. \"I think I'll talk to the boss for a bit before packing those\r\ncrates.\" He winked at Vivi and turned to go.\r\n\r\nBaku looked over his shoulder as Blank came to stand beside him. \"Did you\r\nconvince him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I told him you'd never agree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor kid. You hear about the thing from Doctor Tot?\"\r\n\r\nBlank nodded at his boss. \"Perfectly understandable why he wants to come\r\nthough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't you do the same thing in his position?\"\r\n\r\nBaku grunted and shouted to his men. \"Hurry it up, we gotta schedule to keep! We\r\ngotta play in Alexandria in a week, Iifa Tree or no Iifa Tree!\"\r\n\r\n****\r\n\r\nAll these thoughts flashed back through my head as Zidane spoke his words. We\r\nwere almost gonna now, the Tantalus was about to be broken in half. Only a\r\nmiracle could get us out. In desperation Blank went to the side of the airship\r\nand looked down at the ominous plant core.\r\n\r\n\"Blank!\" Marcus said, \"What are you thinking?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's just like the Evil Forest Marcus!\" Blank shouted as he fended off the\r\nattacking tentacles. \"These plants'll die down once the core is dead!\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't be an idiot!\" Baku shouted, grabbing Blank back from the ship's railings.\r\n\"You won't last two seconds out there!\"\r\n\r\n\"All of us are gonna die at this rate!\"\r\n\r\nBaku and Blank's voices faded out of my head as they kept arguing. I knew Blank\r\nwas right. The ship wouldn't hold much longer, and all of our lives were now\r\nthreatened. Zidane. Baku. Blank. Marcus. Cinna. Benero. Zenero. Genero. And me.\r\n\r\nIn the end, there was no choice, really. One dying soul in exchange for eight\r\nothers to live. After all, nobody wants to live forever.\r\n\r\n\"Zidane!\" I turned to him as I started to gather the last of my energies. This\r\nman had taught me to appreciate who I was, to enjoy life, and to give all of\r\nmyself for what I believe in, and today, I was proud to give myself for him.\r\n\"Please make the princess happy!\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Vivi!\" I could hear Zidane's shout as I ran to the edge of the ship and\r\ndived towards the core, that green bulbous plant that had threatened our lives.\r\nI felt the power coalesce around me as I hurtled downward, dark energies from\r\nbeyond this world gathering around my fingertips.\r\n\r\nI came to this world spawned from this tree, and today I return to it.\r\n\r\n\"Doomsday!\"\r\n\r\n-fin-\r\n\r\nAuthor's rants: Ye gods, the last semester of college really took a lot of wind\r\nout of me, I think. I'm exhausted now, maybe because I decided to do half of\r\nthis all in one sitting. Which would explain why some parts might look like they\r\nwere written hastily. =) Anyway, if you find any such parts, please email me so\r\nI can get around to fixing 'em. Also, I know there's bound to be a lot of\r\nspelling errors here seeing as how my keyboard is behaving abnormally and I\r\ndon't use a spell checker. (I hate Word!) Ah, I'm rambling now. Must be a result\r\nof several months of not writing anything but technical papers. Gotta get some\r\nsleep. (Goes to sleep.)\r\n\r\n",

One particular \r\nstudent, however, was trying to avoid his lunch. This student, Ranma \r\nSaotome, had concealed himself behind the cafeteria doors in hopes of \r\navoiding the \"lunch\" his \"fiancee\" had prepared for him.

Where Ranma go?\"\r\n\r\nRanma and Ukyo had vanished.\r\n\r\nPart Two\r\n\r\nIt was the usual lunchtime scenario at the Furinkan High cafeteria. \r\nVarious students were in various states of gobbling. One particular \r\nstudent, however, was trying to avoid his lunch. This student, Ranma \r\nSaotome, had concealed himself behind the cafeteria doors in hopes of \r\navoiding the \"lunch\" his \"fiancee\" had prepared for him. It wasn't \r\nexactly normal behavior for such a boy to avoid free food, but the \r\nfiancee in question was one Akane Tendo, and her cooking could be used as \r\nnuclear weaponry if only the government realized it.\r\n\r\nAnother fiancee, however, managed to spot him. This time it was \r\nokay.\r\n\r\n\"Ranchan! I brought you some okonomiyaki!\" Ukyo Kuonji's voice came \r\nto Ranma's ears, and Ranma thankfully accepted the okonomiyaki.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks Ucchan\", he said between gobbles.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the nearby wall started to break down.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no...\", Ranma said.\r\n\r\nA purple-haired young girl carrying a delivery tray smashed through \r\nthe wall and deftly pushed Ukyo away from Ranma.\r\n\r\n\"Ranma, I cook special deluxe ramen for ai len!\" Shampoo said, \r\nglomping onto Ranma.\r\n\r\nAll this had not gone unnoticed to Akane Tendo, and right now she \r\nwas emanating an incredibly red battle aura. \r\n\r\n\"Ranma...\" she began, rather furiously.\r\n\r\nAnd suddenly there was a flash of light.\r\n\r\nWhen the light dissipated, Ukyo and Akane looked around in shock.\r\n\r\nRanma and Shampoo had vanished.\r\n\r\nPart Three\r\n\r\nRanma Saotome felt the sensation and recognized it. It was a \r\nfeeling he regularly had, that of submitting his will to gravity.\r\n\r\nHe was falling. \r\n\r\nLuckily, Ranma managed to fall into a convenient clump of bushes on \r\nthe outskirts of Nerima, staving off any real damage (which Ranma \r\nwould've been impervious to, anyway). He jumped up to his feet and \r\nbrushed the dust off his red Chinese clothes. At least this time, he \r\nhadn't landed in water.\r\n\r\n\"What in the world just happened?\" he said to himself out loud. The \r\nshrubbery he had fallen into was just outside the Nerima cemetery, \r\nmeaning he must've flown quite a long way from the Tendo Dojo. The \r\nproblem was, this time he didn't recall anyone in particular smashing him \r\ninto the sky. He doesn't even recall being at the Dojo for the last \r\nthirty minutes. To the best of his knowledge, it was presently lunchtime \r\nat Furinkan High. \r\n\r\nRanma's musings were interrupted by two familiar voices coming from \r\nwithin the cemetery. For some strange reason, Ranma's brain decided to \r\nkick in and realized something strange was going on. The female voice he \r\nheard was definitely Ukyo's. The weird part was the male voice. He could \r\nswear it was...himself.\r\n\r\nConfused, Ranma leaps over the wall and crosses to a nearby tree. \r\nSeveral yards away, he sees Ukyo, and surprisingly, himself! They are in \r\nfront of a grave, and Ukyo seems to be comforting Ranma for some reason. \r\nDeciding that discretion was the better part of valor, Ranma decided to \r\nspy on this impostor. Concealing himself in the nearby shrubbery, he \r\nlistened in to their conversation.\r\n\r\n\"You're doing it again, Ranchan. You keep blaming yourself for what \r\nhappened. Year after year for five years now we've been coming here, and \r\nyou still haven't forgiven yourself.\" Ukyo's voice came to the (hidden) \r\nRanma's ears. \"What?\" Ranma said to himself, \"Ukyo's known this impostor \r\nfor years? Whose grave is this anyway?\"\r\n\r\nThen he heard the impostor's voice, as clear as his own. \"You're \r\nright Ucchan...I just can't help but remember what she meant to me...\"\r\nShe? Ranma wondered to himself.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, Ranchan. It's time to go. Time to move on.\" Ukyo said, \r\nmoving away with the impostor.\r\n\r\nPuzzled, Ranma steps out of the shadows after they leave, then \r\nwalks over and inspects the grave they were visiting. \r\n\r\n\"I..it can't be...\", he said, shocked, \"A--Akane Tendo...died age \r\nseventeen...\". Ranma's brain, which normally could not handle anything \r\nmore complicated than one of Ryoga's schemes, was working overtime. He \r\nhad just been with Akane about an hour ago, insulting her cooking. How \r\ncould she be dead, with her grave here for the past five years? And who \r\nwas that impostor?\r\n\r\n\"Only one person can explain what's going on here,\" Ranma muttered \r\nto himself, \"Either that or she's behind it all.\" \r\n\r\nWith that in mind, Ranma ran off in the direction of the \r\nNekohanten.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo find it no longer there. This was even more of a visual shock \r\nfor Ranma, as it meant he couldn't get free food there anymore. Besides \r\nthat, he had just eaten at the Nekohanten this morning! Something strange \r\nwas definitely going on.\r\n\r\n\"Looking for someone, son-in-law?\" a familiar old voice came from a \r\nnearby rooftop. \r\n\r\nRanma leapt up to the rooftop and found Cologne there. At least she \r\nstill looked the same, if everything else in Nerima had gone crazy. \r\n\r\n\"What's going on, old ghoul?\" Ranma spat out.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, son-in-law, you are as impolite as ever, in any time.\" Cologne \r\nremarked, \"And to think I came all the way from China to visit you.\"\r\n\r\n\"China? What were you doing in China? Where's the Nekohanten? What \r\ndo you mean in any time? And what the hell happened to Akane?\" Ranma \r\nindignantly shot back.\r\n\r\n\"One question at a time, Ranma.\" Cologne pulls out a folded \r\nnewspaper from within here robes. \"Here\", she said, passing the paper to \r\nRanma, \"read it, and tell me what date it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"November 16...1999?!\"\r\n\r\n\"That is correct, son-in-law. You have traveled in time, and you \r\nare now five years into the future.\"\r\n\r\n\"Time travel? But how? Why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop blabbering for a while and listen to me, boy.\" Cologne said, \r\n\"You don't have much time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay.\" Enough time for what?\r\n\r\n\"Five years ago, you and Shampoo were sucked into a temporal rift \r\nnear Furinkan High. You ended up five years in the future, as you are \r\nnow. However, in that future, Shampoo was dead, her body found after she \r\nhad mysteriously vanished for months. When you and Shampoo talked to the \r\nUkyo Kuonji from that time, she said she had also traveled to the future \r\nwith Ranma five years before, and she had seen a timeline where she had \r\ndied. Apparently, in that other time, the same thing that happened to \r\nShampoo happened to Ukyo instead. With their knowledge of their future, \r\nRanma and Shampoo came back, and Shampoo's death was averted. Instead of \r\nShampoo, however, it was Akane Tendo who met their fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"What? How could all this be happening?\" Ranma said, confused.\r\n\r\n\"I believe it has something to do with the temporal rift five years \r\nago, son-in-law. After that experience and with the death of Akane Tendo, \r\nShampoo withdrew her claim to you out of respect for her, and we moved \r\nback to China. The present-day Shampoo told me to meet you here so that I \r\ncould tell you all this. I believe that some force at this time, but not \r\nnecessarily in this timeline, is trying to get you, but someone else \r\nalways gets in the way.\"\r\n\r\nRanma tried to follow all this, failed, tried again, and finally \r\ngot it right. \"How can I stop this? If this is the third time it's \r\nhappened, even if I save Akane in the past, it'll happen to someone else, \r\nright?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a chance, son-in-law. You yourself must face whatever \r\nfate it was that would have fallen upon Ukyo, Shampoo, and now, Akane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you help me?\" Ranma said.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid not, for in this timeline, you are a temporal anomaly, \r\nso you can \"Shift\" back to your time easily, while I cannot. You are \r\nalone this time, son-in-law.\"\r\n\r\nRanma just nodded gravely. \r\n\r\n\"One more thing\", Cologne added, \"when Shampoo came back from her \r\ntemporal journey, she was very disoriented and could barely remember what \r\nhad happened in the past, and she was beaten and bruised. This could help \r\nyou find out who's responsible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Waitaminute!\" Ranma said, \"If Ukyo and Shampoo were with me when \r\nthey time-traveled, then this time...\"\r\n\r\n\"...Akane Tendo would have made the journey with you.\" Cologne \r\nended. \"That is correct, son-in-law. You must find her, before any danger \r\ncomes to her. You might even figure out what's going on.\"\r\n\r\n\"One last thing, \" Ranma said, as the ghoul prepared to hop away, \r\n\"If I do manage to prevent Akane's death, then this timeline is \r\ndestroyed? Do you all die?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know son-in-law.\" Cologne replied, \"We might cease to \r\nexist, or just go on as if nothing happened. We don't truly understand \r\nthe intricacies of time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, ghoul. Gotta go!\" Ranma said, heading for the Dojo. If \r\nAkane was in this timeline, she would head straight for the Dojo. And who \r\nknows how her old man would react!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Akane was having troubles of her own. She had \r\nsuddenly found herself wandering on some street after eating her lunch. \r\nMaybe Ranma was right...maybe her cooking did have hallucinogenic \r\neffects, she thought. That thought had quickly fled her mind and she \r\nrushed to the Dojo to find out what's going on.\r\n\r\nWhen she got there, everyone seemed shocked to see her, as if she \r\nhad come back from the dead or something. Even more shocking was when \r\nthey told her she did come back from the dead! \r\n\r\n\"What do you mean I died five years ago?!\", she asked, incredulous, \r\nwhile trying to shake a crying Soun off her leg, \"Is this some sort of \r\nsick joke ?\", she said, pointedly looking at Nabiki.\r\n\r\nNabiki looked hurt, \"It's not like we would fake your death \r\nAkane...the body was there, we all saw it...Ranma couldn't stop crying \r\nfor weeks...\"\r\n\r\n\"Ranma...\" she said, turning to him, \"were you really worried about \r\nme?\"\r\n\r\n\"Akane...\" the purple-shirted Ranma said, \"I...I always regret not \r\nhaving told you before...but I want you to know that I...\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe red-shirted Ranma Saotome had watched Akane enter the Dojo, but \r\nhad carefully concealed himself on a nearby rooftop. As he watched the \r\npurple-shirted Ranma hug Akane closely, he shifted a bit and considered \r\nrevealing himself and explaining everything.\r\n\r\nBut he knew no one would listen to him anyway, particularly \r\nhimself. He just had to wait until he could talk to Akane alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ranma\", Akane said, breaking the hug, \"I'm confused...just this \r\nmorning I was at school...at Furinkan...how could I have died five years \r\nago?\" She looked at everyone for an explanation.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Akane\", Nabiki said, \"It seems that five years ago, you and \r\nRanma vanished in flash of light near Furinkan...when Ranma came back, he \r\nhad no memory of what happened...and when you came back a week later, you \r\nwere near death...we couldn't save you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry Akane\", Ranma said, \"If only I had done something back \r\nthen...\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! My Daughter!!! My Long-Lost Daughter!!!\", Soun wailed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRanma had caught enough of the conversation to understand what had \r\nhappened. He and Akane had leapt forward five years into the future, and \r\nAkane did not come back alive from the encounter...which meant that \r\nsometime between now and their going back to the past, something bad \r\nwould happen to Akane. He would have to stop whatever it was that was \r\ngoing to happen...but what was it? And why did it also happen to Shampoo \r\nand Ukyo? \r\n\r\n\r\nLater that night, when Akane was about to go to sleep in her newly-\r\nrefurbished room, she heard a knock on her door.\r\n\r\n\"Come in\", she said.\r\n\r\nRanma, still wearing the same purple shirt, came in, and sat down \r\nnext to Akane on her bed.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" she said, a bit annoyed.\r\n\r\nRanma held her hand. \"I just wanted to see if you were okay...\" he \r\ntrailed off.\r\n\r\nAkane was a bit surprised that he held her hand, \"Sorry\", she said, \r\n\"didn't mean to snap at you.\"\r\n\r\nRanma squeezed her hand gently, and she squeezed it back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOutside Akane's bedroom window, Ranma-chan, wearing a wet red \r\nshirt, was watching them. He waited until the purple-shirted Ranma had \r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nAkane sighed as Ranma left the room. Then she heard a slight \r\ntapping on her window. When she turned to look, she was surprised to see \r\na very wet Ranma-chan, in a red shirt, hanging outside her windowsill, \r\nasking to come in.\r\n\r\n\"Ranma!\" she said, opening the window and letting him in, \r\n\"wha...how did you get there? I...we were just...\"\r\n\r\n\"Shh...\", Ranma said, putting a finger to his lips, \"Keep quiet and \r\nI'll explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay\"\r\n\r\n\"You notice how we were in school today, and suddenly you found \r\nyourself somewhere else?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I was wondering what happened...but nobody here could \r\nexplain it...\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I can. Listen...\" Ranma proceeded to tell her Cologne's \r\nstory.\r\n\r\n\"You really expect me to believe something like that?\" Akane said, \r\n\"Cologne must have been joking or something.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no other explanation Akane. The Nekohanten wasn't there \r\nthis afternoon, but it was definitely there when I had breakfast this \r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean you had breakfast with Shampoo?!\" Akane shouted, \"What \r\ndid you think you were doing?!\"\r\n\r\nThe red-shirted Ranma heard footsteps coming and threw himself \r\noutside the window and flipped up to the roof.\r\n\r\nThe purple-shirted Ranma and Kasumi opened Akane's door and rushed \r\ninto the room.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Akane?\" Kasumi said.\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything wrong?\" Ranma said, his concern showing, \"We \r\nheard you shout and...\"\r\n\r\n\"N...no, it's okay. I, um, just saw a mouse, that's all...yeah \r\nthat's it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh my, a rodent!\" Kasumi said, \"I'll have to call some \r\nexterminators!\"\r\n\r\n\"Uh, that's okay Kasumi\", Akane stammered, \"I threw it out of the \r\nhouse.\"\r\n\r\n\"Okay\", Ranma said, stepping out of the room, \"You sure you'll be \r\nall right?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure\"\r\n\r\nRanma and Kasumi left and locked the door behind them.\r\n\r\nAkane went to the window and looked up. \"It's okay\", she whispered \r\nto the moon, \"You can come out now.\"\r\n\r\nThe red-shirted Ranma flipped back into Akane's room.\r\n\r\n\"That was close\", Ranma said, \"we can't let them know who we really \r\nare. They'd never believe it. I know I wouldn't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ranma\", Akane said, \"If that other person is really you, in the \r\nfuture, do you and him have the same, um, feelings? About us, I mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"There's no time for this Akane\", Ranma said, a bit embarrassed, \"I \r\nhave to go and figure out who or what is up to this...\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\" Akane said, \"You'll leave me here?\"\r\n\r\n\"You should be safe here, Akane. They can protect you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can take care of myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, Akane, you're a martial artist too, and all that.\" Ranma \r\nresponded, \"but whatever it is that hits us here, is going to kill you. \r\nAnd I can't risk that happening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ranma...\"\r\n\r\n\"I gotta go. I'll come back when I've figured out what to do.\"\r\n\r\nRanma stepped out of the window and was about to leap into the yard \r\nwhen he heard Akane scream.\r\n\r\n\r\nRanma turned around and saw a weird sight. A blue-violet haze was \r\nforming in Akane's room and there were blue tendrils of energy grabbing \r\nonto her.\r\n\r\n\"Akane!\" Ranma shouted, echoed by another voice from the hallway.\r\n\r\nRanma tried to stop the pulsating blue trails of energy but he was \r\ngrabbed in mid-air and both the red-shirted Ranma Saotome and Akane Tendo \r\nvanished into the vortex.\r\n\r\nThe purple-shirted Ranma Saotome crashed through Akane's room to \r\nfind a small energy vortex shrinking out of sight.\r\n\r\nPart Four\r\n\r\nAkane found herself conscious and tried to move. Unfortunately, her \r\nhands wouldn't agree with her. They were tied up for the moment, \r\nliterally. She was in a small room and tied to a pole. The building \r\nlooked old, as if it would fall down any second. Numerous crates were \r\nlocated in the room. She heard a familiar voice.\r\n\r\n\"He got you too, huh?\" Ukyo's voice came from behind her. \r\n\r\n\"Ukyo!\" Akane turned to see Ukyo and Shampoo also tied up, all \r\nthree of them around the pole. \"Who did this to us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ai ya!\" Shampoo remarked, \"Violent girl not know? It was--\"\r\n\r\nShampoo's sentence was cut short by a small maroon projectile sent \r\nhurtling through the far wall. Instead of crashing into the crates, \r\nhowever, the maroon blur stopped itself in mid-air and settled down on \r\nits feet.\r\n\r\n\"Still can't beat me Ranma m'boy!\" Akane recognized the voice; it \r\nwas...\r\n\r\n\"Happosai!\" Akane said, surprised, \"So you were behind all this!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ai len!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ranchan\"\r\n\r\nRanma had emerged from the hole Happosai had made through the far \r\nwall. He was burning red with battle aura. His clothes were torn in \r\nseveral places and he had a bruise on his right arm.\r\n\r\n\"This ain't over yet, you old freak!\" Ranma spat out.\r\n\r\n\"You're right, Ranma!\" Happosai gloated, \"You still have to bring \r\nme more girlies!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring...?\", Akane said, \"Ranma, you...!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Akane\", Ukyo said, \"it's not his fault...\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, oh!\"\r\n\r\nRanma and Happosai had decided to resume their hostilities, and \r\nthey were moving at incredible speeds. Ranma was dishing out low-level ki \r\nbursts to Happosai at maximum speed. Happosai, however, managed to dodge \r\neach and every one.\r\n\r\n\"Enough playing around, Ranma\", Happosai said, landing on a crate, \r\n\"You've got work to do!\" Suddenly, Ranma noticed a blue sapphire Happosai \r\nwore on his neck. The gem glinted a bit and then blue energy formed in \r\nfront of Happosai.\r\n\r\n\"Time Flare!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ranchan look out!\", Ukyo shouted.\r\n\r\nToo late. A pulsating blue energy burst flew towards Ranma. Ranma \r\nleapt out of the way, but the blast followed him and enveloped him. A \r\nbright light formed around him and he vanished.\r\n\r\n\"Ranma!\" Akane shouted, \"What did you do to him?!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sent him back in time, of course!\" Happosai said gleefully, \r\n\"So he can bring back more girls!\"\r\n\r\n\"What? Where...when are we anyway?\" Akane said.\r\n\r\n\"In your future, of course\", Happosai said, as if Akane would \r\nunderstand immediately. When he saw she didn't he elaborated, \"Five years \r\nto be exact.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why are you doing this to us?!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear Akane, you don't know how terrible it's been!\" Happosai \r\nwhimpered, latching himself unto Akane's chest, \"Allow me a moment in \r\nyour bosom to tell my tale.\" \r\n\r\nAkane fumed a bit, but realizing there was nothing she could do, \r\nnodded. \"Go on.\"\r\n\r\n\"You see, in this future, my future, I had accidentally killed you \r\nall when I discovered the powers of this\", Happosai pointed to the gem \r\nlaced around his neck. \"This\", he continued, \"is the TimeStone. It allows \r\nsomeone to displace another person through time! So, using the powers of \r\nthe Stone, I sent Ranma to the past, knowing that there'd be girls around \r\nhim for sure, and then I moved him five years into the future, and then \r\nshifted him to this future!\"\r\n\r\n\"What! You pervert!\" Akane shouted, \"You're doing all this just so \r\nyou can harass some girls?!\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't understand, Akane\", Happosai continued, \"In this future, \r\nthe Time Stone gives me incredible powers, and I'm close to becoming all-\r\npowerful. However, I need to be in the presence of pretty ladies to be \r\neffective! I drain their youthful energy to become stronger. So I used \r\nRanma as a temporal female magnet!\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait\", Ukyo said, whereupon Happosai immediately leapt off Akane \r\nand glomped onto Ukyo's chest.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" Happosai said.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Ukyo\", Akane smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Grr...anyway, if all this is true, how come Ranma didn't tell us \r\nwhen we time-traveled?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you see, when I shoot him back in time, his mind also goes \r\nback in time. He only remembers what's going on when he gets back here.\"\r\nHapposai explained.\r\n\r\nSo that's it, Akane thought. \"But wait\", she interrupted, \"In the \r\nother timelines, Shampoo and Ukyo managed to survive. That means Ranma's \r\ngoing to beat you!\"\r\n\r\n\"No way, girl!\" Happosai laughed, \"Those weren't my timelines. They \r\nwere just branch-offs that resulted from Ranma's perpetual time-jumping. \r\nWhy, you're already the third batch of girls here!\"\r\n\r\n\"What! Where are the others then.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sent them back, of course. I can't use them anymore after I've \r\nrun them out of energy. In that state, they're already near-death.\"\r\n\r\n\"You monster!\" Akane said, realizing why the other Ukyo, Shampoo \r\nand Akane had died.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing can stop me, Akane-chan!\" Happosai said, glomping on Akane \r\nagain, \"Nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are right. Perhaps not.\" The voice came from somewhere \r\noutside the building.\r\n\r\n\"What the--?!\", Happosai said, \"That voice...\"\r\n\r\n\"You are indeed a menace, in any time, Happy.\" The small figure \r\nsaid as it came into the building.\r\n\r\n\"Ai ya! Great-grandmother!\" Shampoo said.\r\n\r\nThe figure was indeed, Cologne, carrying her staff around her. \"You \r\ndidn't think I'd come along with Ranma, did you?\" Cologne said, \"It's \r\nover Happosai. Surrender the TimeStone!\"\r\n\r\n\"To you? Ha!\", Happosai snickered, \"I killed you months ago, and \r\nI'll kill you again !\" Happosai leapt towards her.\r\n\r\n\"We'll see\", Cologne said, also leaping towards Happosai.\r\n\r\nThe battle began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Ranchan!\" Ukyo said.\r\n\r\n\"Huh?\" Akane said.\r\n\r\n\"Ai len!\" Shampoo said.\r\n\r\n\"Shh\", Ranma said, \"Cologne and I heard everything. Relax, I'll get \r\nyou all free.\" He started to work on the ropes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Elemental Storm!\" Happosai shrieked, creating a powerful hurricane \r\nwithin the building. The roof was blown off and lightning and thunder \r\ncrashed across the sky. He extended his battle aura into the hurricane, \r\nlighting the night with energy.\r\n\r\n\"Hiryu Shoten Ha!\" Cologne countered with the Dragon Cyclone, and \r\nsoon the area was filled with a storm of lightning and flame.\r\n\r\n\r\nRanma, Akane, Shampoo and Ukyo were struggling to stay standing in \r\nthe midst of the powerful display of energy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sorry, Cologne\", Happosai said, momentarily halting the Elemental \r\nStorm, \"I have to send you back now. You just weren't good enough.\" The \r\ngem around Happosai's neck glowed with power and pulsating blue energy \r\ngathered around his body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"No!\" Ranma said, gathering his ki, \"Mokou Takabishya!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ki bolt hit Happosai from behind and disrupted his Time Flare. \r\nCologne, however, was exhausted and landed on the ground, breathing hard. \r\nHapposai turned his attention on Ranma. \r\n\r\n\"All right, then\", Happosai said, gathering his energy again, \"You \r\nfirst. Time Flare!\"\r\n\r\nThe pulsating blue energy bolt leapt towards Ranma. Ranma was \r\nexpecting it and leapt high into the air. Th bolt turned before hitting \r\nthe girls and was close behind him.\r\n\r\nRanma twisted in mid-air and made a dive for Happosai. The energy \r\nbolt turned and followed. \r\n\r\n\"Kachu Tenshin Amaguriken Maximum!\" Ranma said, bringing his fists \r\ninto Happosai.\r\n\r\n\"You can't beat me, boy!\" Happosai said, blocking all 23,000 \r\nattacks. Suddenly Ranma turned sharply and leapt away.\r\n\r\n\"Scared you, didn't I--Ahh!! No!!!\", Happosai's words were cut off \r\nby the blue energy bolt that slammed into him. The energy bolt had failed \r\nto turn and had collided with Happosai, enveloping him with pulsating \r\nblue energy. Happosai faded out of sight. \"I'll be back ... \" his voice \r\ntrailed off. The TimeStone glistened then fell off his disappearing neck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Not bad, son-in-law.\" Cologne said. They had recovered from the \r\nbattle and were studying the TimeStone left behind. \r\n\r\n\"So, how do we get back?\" Ranma said.\r\n\r\n\"This TimeStone is said to be unique throughout all of time. If we \r\ndestroy it here and now, all other traces of it across time and space \r\nshall be destroyed as well.\" Cologne said, \"In which case Happosai would \r\nnever have found it in the first place.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait\", Akane cut in, \"What about us? And all those alternate \r\ntimelines? If Happosai never found it, we shouldn't be here, right?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a temporal paradox\", Cologne explained, \"Once we destroy this \r\nStone, we, and all the alternate timelines, will cease to exist. The day \r\nwill go on as if something never happened. And we will have no memory of \r\nwhat happened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh...\" Akane said, sounding disappointed. She turned to her \r\nfiancee. \"Ranma, what I asked you back in my bedroom...?\"\r\n\r\n\"Um, well...\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough fooling around\", Cologne said, smashing the TimeStone to \r\nbits, \"Let's go.\"\r\n\r\nAnd there was a flash of light.\r\n\r\nPart Five\r\n\r\nIt was the usual lunchtime scenario at the Furinkan High cafeteria. \r\nVarious students were in various states of gobbling. One particular \r\nstudent, however, was trying to avoid his lunch. This student, Ranma \r\nSaotome, had concealed himself behind the cafeteria doors in hopes of \r\navoiding the \"lunch\" his \"fiancee\" had prepared for him. It wasn't \r\nexactly normal behavior for such a boy to avoid free food, but the \r\nfiancee in question was one Akane Tendo, and her cooking could be used as \r\nnuclear weaponry if only the government realized it.\r\n\r\nAnother fiancee, however, managed to spot him. This time it was \r\nokay.\r\n\r\n\"Ranchan! I brought you some okonomiyaki!\", Ukyo Kuonji's voice \r\ncame to Ranma's ears, and Ranma thankfully accepted the okonomiyaki.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks Ucchan\", he said between gobbles.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the nearby wall started to break down.\r\n\r\n\"Oh no...\", Ranma said.\r\n\r\nA purple-haired young girl carrying a delivery tray smashed through \r\nthe wall and deftly pushed Ukyo away from Ranma.\r\n\r\n\"Ranma, I cook special deluxe ramen for ai len!\" Shampoo said, \r\nglomping onto Ranma.\r\n\r\nAll this had not gone unnoticed to Akane Tendo, and right now she \r\nwas emanating an incredibly red battle aura. \r\n\r\n\"Ranma...\" she began, rather furiously, \"How dare you eat their \r\ncooking, and refuse mine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Look, Akane\", Ranma said, pushing off Shampoo, \"In case you \r\nhaven't noticed, a garbage can would be a better alternative than your \r\ncooking!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ranma you jerk!\" Akane screamed, sending Ranma into LEO at the \r\nsame time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRanma landed in the Nekohanten's trash can. Cologne fished him out.\r\n\r\n\"Having trouble with your girlfriends, son-in-law?\" Cologne said.\r\n\r\n\"I am not your son-in-law!\"\r\n\r\nSomewhere in China...\r\n\r\nThe Jusenkyo guide looked out of his window to see a bright blue \r\nlight form over Jusenkyo. The light quickly vanished and a small figure \r\nof a man hurtled towards the cursed springs.\r\n\r\nThe Guide rushed to the pools and saw a small frog hop out of a \r\nnearby pool.\r\n\r\n\"Aw, too bad.\", the Guide said in his weird voice and accent, \"You \r\nfall into Spring of Drowned Frog. Very tragic story of frog that drown \r\nthere seven hundred year ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ribbit.\"\r\n\r\n--End--\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n-----------------------------------------------Author's Witty Repartee---\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThis fic is weird. I wrote this after watching some weird time loop \r\nTV show I couldn't place. Anyway, it's really my first fic, so if you \r\nwanna say anything 'bout it, send stuff to the Nikholas F. Toledo \r\naddress. If is suck, say so, if I don't you can say that too. Oh yeah, \r\nplease check for misspellings or grammar errors or whatever. I am not \r\n\"SWITCH\" OK? I'm just using his address. Oh yeah, could people please \r\nwrite more weird time travel thingies. I'm kinda sick and tired of all \r\nthe herbs and spices plots, and I kinda like pointing out continuity \r\nfaults. BTW, does anybody think Ukyou can beat Kunou in combat?\r\n\r\nNotes (07/04/2003)\r\nThis fic was written in 1994!\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nVECTOR (aka roytang)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Added a start page containing the menu only, so that visitors wouldn't have to listen to me ranting all the time. Uploaded some stuff, since my COMPUTER IS PROBABLY GOING TO DIE SOON! It's on its last legs... I can feel it. Over the next couple of days I'll probably be uploading stuff that I don't have backed up elsewhere. For now the only new upload is a bunch of high school pics. See the Files section for more.\r\n\r\nTowards my resolutions:\r\n\r\nI went on over to FF.net to see if the last fic (Nobody Wants to Live Forever) got any reviews. Whee! Got some positive ones. I'll try to write more soon.\r\n\r\nI downloaded a free Win32 C++ compiler+GUI. It's Dev-C++, available at Bloodshed Software. Also, I downloaded some of the old Win32 programming lessons from ReliSoft. I'll probably redo all the work since my previous trials had been lost in an HD formatting a while back. The sad thing is that the DirectX SDKs are unbelievably huge, 100+ Megs, even the older DX5.0, so I probably won't be doing any DX programming 'til I get a new computer.\r\n\r\nLearning Japanese? Well... I'm working on it I guess. I checked out some lessons at Japanese-Online.com. I've gone through them before, but I didn't really follow through so I forgot. =)\r\n\r\nAnything else? Okay:\r\n\r\nTurns out another Square SNES game has been gifted with a translation patch! The game is Live-a-Live, a strange sort of RPG. I tried it out a bit, but now I'm stuck. =( It's really weird. Hulk Hogan appears in it!

I wanted to put up the Anime ROMs before, but I was worried about what Topcities might do, since Ihaven't heard anything about what they do to copyright violations on member sites.

I'm actually doing this more often than studying for the board, studying game development, studying Japanese or writing anything else. I wonder why? Anyway, I added a humor page and a special \"Who Am I?\" page. Check 'em out. Also the Anime ROMs site should be fully operational by now.\r\n\r\nSo I went and saw Lord of the Rings last Friday. As everyone expected, it was an excellent movie, and the theater was jam packed. We had to use all our mighty skills to get seats. Even my first brother, who doesn't normally watch movies, enjoyed it and said it was great. My only complaint is that the movie is too long! I mean, I know Tolkien created a huge world and all, but did they really have to show the party traveling through numerous forests, mountains and snow without advancing the plot? That's one of the reasons I didn't get to finish the book, I felt the plot dragged along in favor of the lengthy descriptions. The movie does this too, but to a lesser extent.",

My time has been consumed by the evil monster that is Sierra's Betrayal at Krondor. It's an RPG based on Raymond Feist's Riftwar series of books. Haven't read the books myself, but the game is well done, and is still enjoyable despite its age (I think it was released in '92 or such). The game was released by Sierra as freeware to promote the sequel, and it can be downloaded at happypuppy.com \r\n\r\nThe other thing I've been doing, is trying to catch up on my board exam review, and I'm fairly behind schedule. There's around a month and a half left before the exam, but so far I've only reviewed most of the electronics topics. (The reviews are in 3 parts: electronics, communications and mathematics.)\r\n\r\nAnother thing I've been doing was working on my own RPG. The Palefire thing was great, but it seems no one in the group has time to do it anymore. While I still want to do Palefire, it'll have to go to the back burner while everyone gets their acts together. Since I don't have a new comp yet, no RPG programming of any sorts going to take place soon. Right now it's mostly design, world-building, and setting the rules into place. I don't even have a very solid plot yet, but I want to thresh out the world before focusing on the plot. Good luck to me.\r\n\r\nThings I'm not doing: Learning more Japanese (which I promised myself I would do); Studying more programming (same); Writing fiction. I'd update the Mecis story but I found the first part of it severely lacking. When I have time, I'll probably rewrite it altogether.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.happypuppy.com\r",

It's true it was on my old site, but I can not find a reliable indicator of what date it was published. So I will publish it with an arbitrarily chosen date of March 1, 2002.)\r\n\r\nOfficially, this rant should be available upon the re-opening&nbsp;of the NFT Zu webpage, version 4.something. As much as I'd like&nbsp;to babble on about anime or fanfiction, several of my associates&nbsp;here at the Zu know a lot more about those than I do. So I'll&nbsp;stick to something where I can claim some sort of specialized&nbsp;knowledge: video games.\r\n\r\nLately, I've been playing Legend of Mana. It's a little-known&nbsp;Square game for the PSX, the fourth installment in the Seiken&nbsp;Densetsu series of games. It's a quirky little game, but what&nbsp;will strike you most about the game is the amazing graphics. No,&nbsp;I'm not talking about FFVIII-style FMVs or such. I'm talking&nbsp;about the detailed hand-drawn animations. The characters are&nbsp;portrayed by detailed sprites, the backgrounds are colorful,\r\n  \r\nhand-drawn landscapes, nothing like the mundane realism of&nbsp;FMV-based games. Don't get me wrong, I'm not knocking FMV. I&nbsp;certainly appreciate a great CG movie in a game.\r\n\r\nBut these days practically every game and its mother has FMV,&nbsp;and frankly, I tend to grow tired of it. What's wrong with good&nbsp;ol' 2d animation? We see a lot of games pushing the envelope as&nbsp;far as 3d CG FMVs are concerned, but where are the games pushing&nbsp;the envelope of 2d animation? As Legend of Mana and games like&nbsp;Parappa the Rapper show, there are certainly games and stories&nbsp;which are much better told in 2d animation than the mundane 3d&nbsp;videos of today. And for all their technical sophistication, 3d&nbsp;engines are still far more limited than what hand-drawn animation&nbsp;could show us, visions far closer to the artist's\r\n  \r\nimagination.\r\n\r\nSo where are all the 2d RPGs? Sadly, outside of Square and&nbsp;Capcom, no one seems to be capable of thinking for themselves and&nbsp;differentiating themselves from the pack. In this case the&nbsp;console RPG scene suffers from a common problem: lack of&nbsp;innovation. Aside from a couple of industry leaders, few&nbsp;companies can afford to \"try something different\" when they have&nbsp;sales to make. It's far easier to do what everybody else is doing&nbsp;than to try out something which may or may not sell. The 2d RPG&nbsp;seems to be going the way of the handheld, as practically all 2d&nbsp;RPGS these days are being announced for GBA only, with the PS2,&nbsp;XBOX and GC all geared towards powerful 3d apps.\r\n\r\nGranted, all of this might be chalked up to the fact that I'm&nbsp;an old-school gamer of sorts, and you could argue that \"3d is the&nbsp;wave of the future!\" But if you look at Legend of Mana, and its&nbsp;younger SNES brother Secret of Mana, you can't help but see how&nbsp;2d animation has improved by leaps and bounds over the years,&nbsp;albeit unnoticed compared to the attention 3d animation has been&nbsp;getting. Five years ago, all these 3d games were getting noticed&nbsp;because they were bringing us something new, a greater sense of&nbsp;realism than what 2d animation could bring. Back then 3d WAS the&nbsp;wave of the future. Today, it IS the future, and 3d games are the\r\n  \r\nnorm, and 2d animation offers us something different, something&nbsp;fresh.\r\n\r\nWhat am I saying? I want to see more 2d games, RPGs&nbsp;specifically. I want to see more Saga games, more Mana games,&nbsp;more Breath of Fire. I want to see new sprite-based RPGs. I want&nbsp;to see more fantasy worlds that look fantastic, more anime&nbsp;cut-scenes. Is it all too much to ask?\r\n\r\n-Thinking about getting a GBA before a PS2",

There must have been several hundred people crammed into less than two hundred square meters of mall area, interspersed with some twenty cubicles filled with various displays and banners. What madness is this you ask? What product could be so enticing that hundreds of otherwise sane people to participate in such a gathering, jostling for space and risking being elbowed, stepped on or maybe even pick pocketed? The answer was employment. That most important symptom of security that people crave especially in tough times such as these.\r\n\r\nYes, my friends, it is a job fair. Hopeful job-seekers from all over the capital converge upon this establishment in the commercial district and hope to find gainful opportunities in these otherwise difficult times. I am one of such hopefuls. Weaving amongst the crowd and perusing various company paraphernalia, I search for the perfect job for one of my skills.\r\n\r\nHere's one, an engineering job, sounds promising. Oh, it's in Bulacan, a good three hours away from home. No thanks. Hmm, there's an opening in this Japanese company. Wait, I already applied for that a couple of months ago. How about a teaching job at some technical college? No thanks, there are better schools out there for me to teach at.\r\n\r\nI chuckle at my own audacity. For someone who had been unemployed for a good six months now I was being extremely picky. How many job applications had I botched over the past six months? At least three that sounded promising. And for no apparent reason aside from the vague \"I wouldn't like it there\" or \"It's not the right job for me.\" Sometimes I wonder what it is I really want.\r\n\r\nOr maybe that's the problem. For someone who spent the last few years of his engineering studies whining about how he should have shifted to another course, I had no real idea about what it was I wanted to do. Well, no practical idea at least. I know I eventually want to work in interactive entertainment software (read: computer games), but that's not really a plausible option right now. Aside from that, nothing. I have no idea where to go or how to get there.\r\n\r\nI know I need a job. Heaven knows I've sponged off my folks long enough. But what job? I look at the hordes of people applying for boring, everyday office jobs and I shake my head. I don't want to end up some office drone who can't break out of his routine. I don't want a job that is tedious and boring. I don't want to be some staff engineer doing the same things day in and day out. I want to learn, I want to be challenged, I want to expand my horizons. I want a job that's exciting, constantly unpredictable, a job where being unable to adapt can only cause disaster. I don't want a job that asks me to be tied down for two to three years. I hardly have enough attention span for a semester of classes, how could I stand being in the same job for several years? I don't want a job that's mundane, mediocre or ordinary. I want something different, something exciting, something that amazes people when they ask.\r\n\r\nMaybe I'm being unrealistic or a bit too idealistic, as is common for me at times. But I remember one time when I asked one of the guys I went to college with what he was planning to do after his studies. He said something about joining a big company and rising up the corporate ladder. What kind of dream is that, to be someone else's employee? And this was someone who would later on graduate with honors! I would rather be self-employed, risking my own money on a venture that may or may not succeed. If you fail, then you try again. At least you rise and fall through your own decisions, your fate belongs to you, and not to some anonymous board of directors.\r\n\r\nAlas, that's not possible for me right now, not when I don't have a shred of cash. And until I do, I am left with little choice but to undergo some mind-numbing mundanity of a job. Gainful employment is a necessary evil for now, so onward I march, ever searching for an ideal job that will tide me through until such time that I find the means to take my destiny into my own hands. My time will come, someday.",

Six months (okay three) of hard work and preparation (well alright, occasionally glancing at my books) and what do we get? A bunch of questions chosen seemingly at random. The Math and Electronics parts were good enough actually, and I felt pretty confident there. The second day was bad. The Communications exam might as well have been a random set of questions about cookie dough and displacer beasts. Me, Marc and Dennis went through at least a hundred questions in various topics an hour and a half before the exam but not one of the stuff we reviewed came out. Instead we're bombarded with questions about obscure standards and various laws. \\Sigh\\\r\n\r\nOr maybe I'm just sour-graping because I didn't make the top ten [link broken]. Then again I was expecting at least Dennis to make it in, but no such luck. Are there any other UP studes in the top ten? I don't know, and I'm not sure I care anymore. Oh well, that's the breaks.\r\n\r\nI finished Tales of Phantasia yesterday, finally. I must've been playing it for about half a year before I managed to finish it. Emulators are really bad for your attention span &#8212; I've got a Seiken Densetsu game near the end but I haven't touched it for maybe a year now. Anyway, I went and kicked Dhaos butt, even though I wasn't able to complete the better subquests, complete Arche's spells or even get Gremlin and Shadow. Maybe another time. Or if Namco decides to be nice and release it for the PSX. Oh yeah, I put up the ending save state here [link broken]. Hopefully one of these days I can finish the Ranma RPG, SD3 and DQ5, not necessarily in that order.\r\n\r\nSo I've been playing Hoshigami lately. When I first bought it and tried it out I thought it was a horrible game. It's quite hard, and you will easily die if you don't know what you're doing. Now I realize the reason I was having such a hard time was because I was trying to play it like FF Tactics or Tactics Ogre. Instead, the RAP gauge encourages an entirely different way of thinking. You have to learn how to conserve your RAP, to know how to use the turn sequence properly, when to shoot and when not to shoot, and when to attempt a session. Granted, knowing all this stuff doesn't make the game that much easier &#8212; but I find myself enjoying it once I familiarized myself with the different tactics. Sadly, very few people will be able to appreciate this game. I'm in Chapter 2 and I've already burned 20 hours of game time and probably a lot more in real-time &#8212; I tend to lose battles often. =P\r\n\r\nThe following web sites are graciously hosting some of my fiction, so be nice and visit them: Icy Brian's RPG Page and Laura's Sailor Moon Shrine [link broken] (although why a SM shrine would have FF fanfiction is beyond me. =)\r\n\r\nLast week we saw The Count of Monte Cristo.

I stopped playing the game a month or so ago out of sheer irritation.\r\n\r\nFor the uninitiated, H:RBE is a tactical RPG for the PSX, released during the last year the PSX. The game is similar in some respects to games like Final Fantasy Tactics and Tactics Ogre, with an emphasis on turn-based squad-level combats. Unlike FFT and TO's similar Active Time system, H:RBE uses a system called RAP, where each character can perform as many actions as he wants provided he still has the RAP gauge to pay for it. The more RAP you use, the sooner your next turn comes, and vice versa. I bought this game hoping it would be at least comparable to either FFT or TO. Was I disappointed? Read on.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nThe Good:\r\n\r\nRAP. RAP is good. The fact that you get to decide how to allocate your time, and the fact that you can control when your characters get to act. This is good.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nShoot. Shoot is good, a nice ability that adds a different tactical angle to the game, emphasizing the importance of position.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nSession. Since Shoot is good, it follows that Session must be good.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nDifficulty. Yes, difficulty is good, to a certain extent. Hoshigami brings a new level of difficulty to the table that we didn't get to have in the ridiculously easy FFT. Veteran gamers were looking for a level of difficulty closer to that of the old favorite, Tactics Ogre. The game's difficulty is actually still good (albeit good on the masochistic side) but the actual difficulty is overshadowed by the fact that it's \\tedious\\. Read on.\r\n\r\nThe Bad:\r\n\r\nLack of variation. You basically have only five things to do: attack, shoot, move, cast spells or use items. And spells do only one of three things: deal/heal damage, or create/heal status or break equipment. Where's the Haste spell? Protection spells?\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nLong battles. The lack of variation wouldn't be so bad if you didn't have to endure it for hours at a time.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nNo saving between successive battles. That was a bad, bad, design boo-boo. You've been fighting for hours on end, and you're almost finished, when a lucky archer drops the bomb on Elena.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nBad AI. You know what I'm talking about. Archers who don't understand the trajectory of their weapons. Enemies who kill each other. Soldiers who attack even if the hit chance is 0%.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nUnforgiving design. Permanent death. Underlevelled party has no chance against higher level party. Masses of enemies thrown at you. It's like the designers decided that instead of simply working on tactically challenging battles, they would throw lots of enemies at you, at higher levels than you would expect and hope that you have the tactical ability to overcome this. It was a good idea except for the fact that LOW-LEVEL CHARACTERS STAND NO CHANCE AGAINST HIGH-LEVEL CHARACTERS. Even if you're only two levels behind, your damage and hit rate become so pitiful that you simply won't survive one-on-one, what more two-on-one. The game would've been 300 times better if either a) story battles had the same level as you; or b) The number of units on each side are comparable. As it is, the only real reliable way to win in battles is through either Coinfeigms or leveling-up. Which wouldn't be so bad except that... \r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nLevelling-up is tedious. Since you will almost never meet enemies in the Towers who are at the same level as yours, you're stuck fighting lower level goons while occasionally hitting yourselves for EXP. And not only that... \r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nLevelling up Coinfeigms is tedious. Yes it is. The interface is so bad; every time you engrave your coin, you must go back to the top of the list of seals and look for the seal again. Given that you often want to engrave your coins multiple times with the same seals, the game becomes unnecessarily tedious. Adding to this is the \"random\" factor involved in engraving. I'm sure during development it seemed like a neat concept and all, but in practice all it means is that you have to occasionally save in-between engravings.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nDeity/DEV system. Good idea, poor execution. Some of the abilities are simply worthless, and some are strictly better. You will seldom need to change your abilities around. Status-enhancing abilities are generally useless at 10%, slightly better at 25%. Champion sounded cool, except in practice you never want to have anyone with low HP. Furthermore, the system is unbalanced. Sonova people simply suck, despite their HP Bonuses.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nNo randomness. All battles are fixed. No hoping to meet an Uribo here, folks, each battle gives you the exact same opponents every time.\r\n\r\nThe Ugly\r\n\r\nthat sad, sad battle theme. I end up unplugging the audio cord on the TV whenever I play Hoshigami.\r\n\r\nAll in all, what went wrong in this game? The thing is that the designers thought people wanted a difficult game, so they made a difficult game. The problem is that they achieve that difficulty through repetitiveness, redundancy and tediousness. On the GameFAQs message boards I read an analogy comparing Hoshigami to Chess. The difference between Hoshigami and Chess is that in Chess, both sides start with the same pieces, and you win or lose based on your own tactical decisions. In Hoshigami, not only does your opponent get more pieces than you, they're all bishops and knights while you're stuck with a platoon of pawns. And you have to play that game of chess some 50 times, without losing, ever.",

If\r\n  \r\nrushing is the means for that win, you should go for it.\r\n\r\nWhat does this mean? If you don't want to be rushed, don't\r\n  \r\nplay on Battle.net, because on Battle.net people play primarily\r\n  \r\nto win and secondarily for fun.\r\n\r\nGet a bunch of friends together and hook up a LAN and play\r\n  \r\namongst yourselves, where you can have your own rules like \"No\r\n  \r\nrushing!\" or \"Announce before attacking!\" or \"No building fifty\r\n  \r\nmillion towers!\"\r\n\r\nIf you insist on playing on Battle.net, don't play 3v3 or 4v4;\r\n  \r\nit's in these formats that rushing is a very viable strategy. I\r\n  \r\nfind that 2v2 is best, as there is little human interaction in\r\n  \r\n1v1.\r\n\r\nIf you think that rushing makes the game \"no fun\", then maybe\r\n  \r\nyou should be playing another game. Warcraft III is a *strategy\r\n  \r\ngame*, the \"fun\" is in finding strategies to beat your opponent.\r\n  \r\nRushing is a strategy, just like any other, and it can be\r\n  \r\ndefeated just like any other strategy (otherwise 100% of people\r\n  \r\nwould be rushing, which isn't true)\r\n\r\nDo you always get beaten by rushes? Maybe you should look at\r\n  \r\nyour build order to see how you could improve speed-wise or get\r\n  \r\nmore defense early on. Look at replays to see how people beat off\r\n  \r\nrushes. Scout ahead to know they are coming. Practice against two\r\n  \r\nor more computer opponents to test yourself. The key to improving\r\n  \r\nis not to whine about things that are \"cheap\" or \"no fun\" but to\r\n  \r\nstudy ways to beat those things.\r\n\r\nAs a note, I am not a rusher. Not often anyways. I will rush\r\n  \r\nevery so often, but only for variation. I attack when I can,\r\n  \r\ncreep when I can, and tech as fast as possible.\r\n\r",

Some people might argue that personal pages are like the dregs of the internet. And they're probably right. Given that any random joe-on-the-street can get on Geocities and build his own website, (like royness.vze.com for instance) we're certainly bound to see all sorts of stuff (and accordingly, all sorts of crap) on the internet.\r\n\r\nSee, that's the thing: \"All sorts of stuff.\" It's pretty much the same way Forrest Gump describes a box of choc'lates: You never know what you're going to get. And occasionally, you get some good stuff. And for people like me, who are obsessed with the trivial, stuff is good. The same way that people browse through bargain bins looking for good deals, I like to browse through personal pages looking for something read-worthy (or even better, download-worthy.)\r\n\r\nThe problem with most personal pages on the &#8216;net however, is that they are crap. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of good ones out there. (Try a href=\"http://www.toastyfrog.com\" target=\"_top\"Toastyfrog/a or maybe Seanbaby) But the fact is that a whole lot of websites are done by people just learning to do HTML or trying it out. Not that being a newbie is a bad thing; the bad thing is when you make a website just for the sake of having one, just so you can say you know how. Websites built in this manner typically end up the sort that's filled with all sorts of tricks like animated GIFs, scrolling marquees or a ton of Javascript. Lots of flash but not much content really.\r\n\r\nHere are some tips for people who want to make their own website:\r\n\r\nHave something to offer. Many people build personal sites with the attitude of \"It's my website, what do you care what I put on it, anyway!\" Yeah well, if you don't care what people think about it, why are you putting it up on the net? Leave it on your computer if that's your attitude. Websites are put up for public consumption, so there has to be something there for people to consume. If you're going to put up a website, make sure you have something to offer the public other than an \"under construction\" page. Otherwise, you're just wasting people's bandwidths aren't ya? When you're just starting out with the idea of \"I want to have my own webpage\", it might be hard to think of what your webpage can offer the world. It doesn't have to be anything big or extra popular, you can start small. I originally put this website up just to host some fanfiction. (And then I put up more and more stuff... ) You can put up your writings, reviews of things you like, links to interesting places, info about yourself, announcements about events you're involved with, etc.\r\n\r\nBe original. This is hard to do in today's web. Most of the things people put up on their websites can undoubtedly be found elsewhere on the web. What can you do to set yourself apart from the crowd? Use more original content, or if you're lacking in that department, look for different ways to present your content. An example would be when I was first learning HTML, I tried to make a Rurouni Kenshin web site. At first I was going to put in info about the characters, story etc. But after looking around a bit, I saw that there were already many websites around for this popular anime series. So instead, I put up info about the fighting styles and techniques of the RK characters, something that I couldn't find at that time. (Don't try looking for this so-called RK site of mine, I took it down a long time ago. I still have the files and may revive it someday though.)\r\n\r\nKnow what contrast is. Look at this site and you'll know what I mean.\r\n\r\nDon't try to do everything at once There are people who make websites with the idea that their site will be \"next big thing\" of the internet. It won't, trust me. Not anytime soon at least. Although there are a lot of crap sites, there are also a lot of good sites, and the best ones have developed from small sites with a limited following to being read by millions. You, with your meager resources and staff of (probably) one can't hope to achieve that overnight. Start small, focus on what your site can provide to your viewers right now instead of trying to be a really big thing. See that site I linked to above? The front page says \"Your number one sorce for your anime needs.\" Not only is that misspelled, but it's so far from the truth.\r\n\r\nKnow how to spell and know how to write proper English (or whatever language is your choice). I'll cite the above link as an example again. How do you expect your readers to take your website seriously if you can't even spell \"sorce\" properly? Go back to school first, then make a website. Additionally, you may want to leave the l33t sp33k for mIRC, unless that's what your audience expects.\r\n\r\nWrite for your audience That way, they can come back later. Don't do things like writing in l33t when your viewers will probably hate it. For a personal site, your initial audience is probably going to be mostly you, and maybe some friends and family. When you want to start attracting more people to your site, you may also consider writing for people who think like you. This are the best kind of viewers, as they will like what they see and will usually come back for more.\r\n\r\nKnow how to take criticism Actually, this is advice for being on the internet in general. Remember that the internet is a public medium, and anything you offer on the internet can be criticized by anyone. A lot of stupidity on the internet comes from people not knowing how to take criticism. Study the criticism and correct your mistakes. Accordingly, I want to apologize in advance to the owner of the site I've been using as a bad example &#8212; I have nothing against you, yours was just the website I had open at the time of this writing.\r\n\r\nHave links. Links are always good because if the rest of the website is bad, at least there's a chance of finding something better to read. If your website could have only one thing, have links.\r\n\r\nDang, this turned out longer than I thought it would. I have a lot more to say on this topic, I'll say them next week. Later!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://royness.vze.com\r\n [2]: http://www.seanbaby.com\r",

I'm glad I got the whining done in the last post. Spent the night before at David's (whose birthday is a couple of days before mine). Dave, Mon and I played approximately seven hours of CvS2, watched a Jet Li flick then played around eight hours of Warcraft III. WC3 is the bomb! (And it further highlights my craving for a new computer) Anyway, went home the next morning, got some sleep. Then the usual birthday food in the evening, and some new pants.\r\n\r\nI had forgotten to go to Church that morning (curse you Warcraft III!!!) so I decided to go to Church this morning. Before going I was stiull a bit down about being a 24-year old bum, but somehow going to Church gave me back a bit of hope. Funny how although I'm not a very good practicing Catholic, a few quiet moments with God are enough to change my perspective on things.\r\n\r\nIn any case, this is the start of a new year, hopefully one better than the last. I don't know where fate will take me this year, but I will face life with open arms, overcome all challenges and spit in the face of destiny. All things happen for a purpose, hopefully soon i will know mine.",

I was quite optimistic too &#8212; the position was for a \"Java Trainee.\" I was more than willing to be trained, and a trainee position meant you didn't have to be proficient in Java right? Turns out I was wrong. =( Apparently they needed someone with some experience in Java, preferably with a project or two under his belt. I tried to convince the interviewer that I had a lot of raw talent and learn pretty fast anyway, but I haven't got any high hopes. That pissed me off.\r\n\r\nEven worse, I had gone to Ortigas with just enough cash to make the trip back and forth. I had left a good two hundred bucks at home &#8216;coz I forgot to pick 'em up and put 'em in my wallet. I was thinking of trying out the arcade version of Capcom vs SNK 2, maybe buying a CD or two. But no! Now I couldn't even grab a bite on the way home. That pissed me off.\r\n\r\nLater that night, my mother was watching \"While You Were Sleeping\", and I was feeling so depressed I was wondering what would happen if I ended up like Sandra Bullock at the start of the movie &#8212; alone, and working a dead end job as a ticket seller. Sigh\r\n\r\nIt's not just the fact that I'm still unemployed &#8212; it's been a good nine months now and I've kinda gotten used to that. It's the realization that despite whatever work I've done in school, I can't get a job. It's as if everything I learned in college was useless.\r\n\r\nWhen I was finishing up in UP, everything seemed simple &#8212; I'd graduate and all my troubles would be over. I'd get a job at maybe Canon or Intel, save a bit, buy a new computer and a PS2, et cetera. To tell the truth I was probably spoiled by those teachers that kept telling us that simply being graduates of the State University was good enough to land a job. I ought to sue those teachers for mental anguish or something. I graduated from one of the hardest course at one of the best universities in the country, and I can't land a job. Gosh darn it all.\r\n\r\nAfter thinking about this, I thought I'd evaluate my own skills to see what could be done. Lemme see, I can do:\r\n\r\n  Embedded software. Since I did two thesis-level projects involving embedded software, I reckon I'm fairly good at this. The problem is that I've only come across one job opportunity where this skill would be useful, and I never got a callback (and\r\n  \r\n    I thought it was a pretty good job for me too.)\r\n  Programming. This would be great, until I acknowledge that while I'm a programming genius, I don't actually have any application-level programming experience under my belt. I'm good a coding, optimizing programs, finding solutions to tough problems, but I've never been part of a large-scale software project, even though I could probably do it all myself, in theory.\r\n  Web Development. I know HTML and various scripting languages, can use Macromedia Dreamweaver and Flash, what can't I do? The problem comes up again: I know it all in theory, but lack the experience. It's not like I'm churning out webpages at a dime a\r\n  \r\n    dozen, and most places looking for web developers ask for some level of experience. Curses.\r\n  Write. Or at least I like to think I can. But it doesn't sound very profitable to be writing for a living... \r\n\r\nSigh, that's it. Pretty sad, huh? The main problem seems to be most of what I can do is self-taught and relies on my raw talent instead of actual experience. What is it with the world? Why can't they just recognize my genius and overlook my lack of experience? I learn impossibly fast anyway, anything I don't know I can pick up quickly. Argh.\r\n\r\nOh well, at least now I feel better, having put my thoughts into words. This journal thing is probably really healthy for me. I get to whine without burdening anyone with my problems.\r\n\r\nThere's still some hope, at least. Sir Louie, the ECE guy Tito Ferry set me up with, said he'd ask around, although he did recommend I learn a few more skills by taking some short courses at APC, an IT school near SM North. I'm a bit hesistant about that though &#8212; short courses will undoubtedly cost money, and I don't want to bother my parents about cash any more than I have to. It's bad enough I can't help them make ends meet... \r\n\r\nAnything else? Lately we've been watching Excel Saga (ridiculosuly funny! Pedro!!!) and Scryed. AXN is showing two new anime series: Ayashi no Ceres and Gensomaden Saiyuki. And they brought back Monday night anime, so more anime all around. Oh yeah, the A/V cable for our PSX is apparently busted. Which probably explains why I got rather pissed off today. Just when I was gonna get adult Rei back into the party! Without the PSX to distract me, I had no choice but to face my real-world problems\r\n\r\n=(\r\n\r\nIn any case, I guess I have no choice but to keep going and hope for the best. I got a nice quote today from Castaway, from Tom Hanks of all people:\r\n\r\n _\r\n  \r\n \"I know now I have to keep on breathing. Because the sun will rise tomorrow, and you never know what the tide will bring.\"\r\n  \r\n_\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by pikapika2501 on 2008-01-29 02:58:53 +0000\r\nHi I'm pika.

The Bourne Identity stars Matt Damon as rogue CIA agent/amnesiac Jason Bourne. In his quest to uncover his own identity, Jason travels all around Europe pursued by the CIA's agents and dragging along an innocent gypsy girl who just happened to be his best shot for a ride to Paris.\r\n\r\nNow, I haven't read the book in ages, so I can't say for sure how faithfully the story translates to the movie (although as I recall there was a lot more traipsing across Europe &8212; I may be wrong though) so I have to judge the movie on its own merits.\r\n\r\nOn its own merits, the movie falls short of my expectations. Mainly because I was expecting some fast-paced action, but most of the time it's just Jason and Marie running and hiding from the CIA. It's more of an action/thriller than a straight action flick &#8212; Jason spends a lot of time trying to uncover the conspiracy behind his pursuers. However, it doesn't seem to pull off either the thriller part or the action part very well. The thriller part doesn't fly because we know what's going on well before Jason does &#8212; the movie shows us what's going on at CIA HQ, how his boss travels to Paris to mete him, et cetera. The action part doesn't fly because the thriller parts get in the way. DOn't get me wrong, there are some cool action stunts here &#8212; Jason riding a free-falling body down the center of a spiral stairway to gun down one of the CIA agents &#8212; but they are few and far between. Also, the director seems to enjoy some sort of shaky, jarring camera work &#8212; not really a problem but occasionally\r\n  \r\nannoying.\r\n\r\nOverall: Good enough, I suppose. The director is no Robert Ludlum\r\n  \r\nbut the story is told well enough.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nAustin Powers in Goldmember\r\n\r\nDo I make you horny baby?\r\n\r\nAnother Austin Powers movie? Well I knew what to expect &8212; more of the same. I got what I expected, but that isn't really a bad thing. As usual with Austin Powers movies, some parts tend to drag on, while some parts are simply \"laugh-out-loud\" funny. This time, Dr. Evil enlists the aid of 70's criminal mastermind Goldmember in a nefarious plot to extort money from the world leaders (as if you didn't know.) Austin himself gets some help (aside from the requisite Powers girl Beyonce Knowles as Foxy Cleopatra) &#8212; from none other than his dear old dad, legendary secret agent Nigel Powers (played by Michael Caine) This one has a bit more story than the first two &#8212; you get to find out more about Austin and Dr. Evil's history, and some strange plot twists ensue. Expect the return of such characters as MiniMe, Fat Bastard and Dr. Evil's wayward son Scott. Also a new character on the side of British Intelligence is played by Wonder Years star Fred Savage\r\n\r\nThe funniest parts are mostly during the opening sequence and towards the end. Expect more gross, insensitive and blatantly offensive humor, more naked bodies, more Fat Bastard crapping, more silhouette jokes, more making fun of MiniMe, hollywood cameos, movie spoofs and the like. This time however, things don't stay the same. Some changes in the status quo happen towards the end and this will obviously not be the last Austin Powers movie.\r\n\r\nOverall: I liked the second one better, but this one's good too. As is the case with Austin Powers movies, it's not for the easily offended.\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nSigns\r\n\r\nCrop circles? This isn't the X-files is it?\r\n\r\nOf the three movies I saw this week, \"Signs\" was the one I was looking forward to the least. The trailer didn't really give me a good impression &8212; looked like some cheap X-Files ripoff with Mel Gibson as Fox Mulder. As it usually happens, turns out I was wrong about the whole thing -- \"Signs\" is one helluva good movie.\r\n\r\nLet's get it out first: \"Signs\" is about an alien invasion. We're talking spaceships and green men. However, unlike movies like Independence Day which tell the story of how the world comes together to defeat an alien menace, \"Signs\" tells the story of how a family comes together to survive fear, paranoia and green men knocking on their door. All of the Independence Day stuff happens, but never at the forefront of the story &#8212; the giant spaceships are there, somewhere in the background, shown on\r\n  \r\nTV.\r\n\r\nThe story is about a farmer and his family in a small rural town. Overnight, mysterious crop circles appear in his fields. Later on, more signs appear &#8212; prowlers around their house, strange radio noises. As a former minister, Mel Gibson faces what he fears the most &#8212; the idea that there is no God, and that he and his family are left to fend for themselves against whatever threat is there lurking in the shadows.\r\n\r\nThe movie is extremely well-written, with all the characters playing their parts well, and all the elements coming together towards the end to make a whole lot of sense.\r\n\r\nOverall: Go see it. Now. Unless you're like my kid brother who would probably get nightmares just thinking about an alien invasion.",

        "content": "---\r\nauthor: roy\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2002-11-30 01:30:03\r\ntags:\r\nLegacy Blog Posts\r\nGaming\r\ntitle: Square Enix\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2002/11/square-enix/\r\n---\r\n\r\nAnyway, I've had a couple of days to think about it, so I'd like to share my thoughts on the matter.\r\n\r\nFirst, the facts:\r\n\r\nEnix and Square are merging. Square stock will be bought out for Enix stock at 0.81 Square per 1 Enix. The Square president will be head of Square Enix, the Enix board remains in place, they'll move into Enix headquarters in Shibuya.\r\n\r\nAll currently announced releases will go on as scheduled. A FF/DW merger may be in the offing, but no definite plans, and probably only as a side release. No personnel will be let go.\r\n\r\nSquaresoft is: Final Fantasy, Chrono, Xeno, SaGa, Mana and assorted other titles.\r\n\r\nEnix is: Dragon Quest/Warrior, Soul Blazer series, 7th Saga, Actraiser, Tri-Ace (Star Ocean, Valkyrie Profile), and a lot of stuff that never made it outside Japan. Enix also has a deal with GameArts on co-developing the Grandia series.\r\n\r\nSony, one of Square's major stockholders, will have it's shares diluted to 8% of Square/Enix.\r\n\r\nNamco, another game company also has some stock in both Square and Enix, and is the publisher of Xenogears' prequel, Xenosaga.\r\n\r\nSquare also has a US publishing deal with EA, set to expire at the end of the year. (This last tidbit may not mean anything... )\r\n\r\nSquare also recently acquired the Quest team (responsible for Tactics Ogre series) and the rights to the Ogre Battle franchise.\r\n\r\nOkay, what can we see?\r\n\r\nFirst off, Enix will be in control, at least at first. Although the Square guy will be Pres, the Pres can always be overridden by the board, and the Enix board will remain in place until they hold a stockholder election thingy, whatever that's called. You might think this is bad \"Oh no, Enix is in control, that means FF is doomed!\" Of course not. They're not stupid. The fact is that Enix being in control of the company's vision and direction makes more sense in light of Square and Enix's overlapping powers. Square develops most of it's products in-house, while Enix publishes a lot of products from other developers like Tri-Ace and Gamearts. Therefore, it makes more sense for Enix to be in control of administrative/business stuff, leaving Square staff to focus on what they do best &#8212; game development.\r\n\r\nBut what does this mean to us as gamers? In the immediate future, nothing really. All the currently announced projects are unaffected: we'll still get FFXI, FFXII, FF:Crystal Chronicle, FFTA, Unlimited Saga, etc. The only thing I've found people to be questioning on message boards is whether FF1-2 (which still doesn't have a definite announcement of a US release) will have an English version. This is a possible concern, as Enix didn't even bother to release an English version of their own DW4. Who knows, maybe we'll get a collection of DW4 and FF1-2? 😛 (Addendum: FF1-2 has been announced for US release.)\r\n\r\nBut after the immediate future, what then? Square Enix will almost\r\n  \r\ncertainly continue the Final Fantasy and Dragon Warrior lines. The future for the Chrono series also seems bright, as the original Chrono Trigger was a collaboration between Square and some of Enix's creative staff. Stuff from Tri-Ace and GameArts will probably go on as before, seeing as these development studios are mostly independent of Enix anyway. And if we're lucky, we'll get another Soul Blazer trilogy.\r\n\r\nWhat I worry about are Square's \"secondary\" RPG series: SaGa and Mana. Now that Square Enix will have two \"big\" series under it's roof, will they still have time to develop these still-young series?\r\n\r\nAlthough not really related to the merger, things also look bright for fans of FFTactics. Aside from the upcoming FFTA, Square's acquisition of Quest and the Ogre Battle franchise means we'll probably see more FFT/TacticsOgre type games coming from them. Combined with the unique gameplay perspective of Tri-Ace, who knows what interesting games will come out?\r\n\r\nI've been looking around on message boards after the news came out, and it seems a lot of people are worried about how Enix might screw up Final Fantasy, or Square screw up Dragon Warrior or anything like that. To this, again I say: They're not stupid. FF and DW, although they have the same roots, are completely different series now, and their different styles again reflect how Square and Enix can complement each other's strengths. Well, I guess DW will benefit the most, as it's sorely lacking in FFs specialty: really good graphics.\r\n\r\nAnother concern that has been raised has been the possibility of a monopoly in RPG games. With this merger, a lot of the big RPG names are now under one roof. Won't the lesser competition cause more lackluster RPGs to be put out? Maybe, but I doubt it. Square Enix still can't afford to let up on the quality, as there are still a good number of other good up-and-coming series out there: Suikoden (Konami), Wild Arms (Sony?), Tales (Namco) and Breath of Fire (Capcom) all still have quite some following and good potential. In fact the above titles will probably slug it out for the Number 2 Console RPG Developer slot... \r\n\r\nAll in all, the opinions I've read on the web are mixed: some are good, some are bad. My own personal take is that it's good; mergers generally mean two companies wanting to capitalize on each other's strengths, not share each other's weaknesses. Let's just wait and see, and hope for the best. 😛",

First I had to wrestle with my PC's small case, trying to figure out where to place the thing. Then, given how old my PC is, it predictably failed to detect the whole capacity of the drive, insisting it was only 8 Gb. I went down to Seagate's website and did some Dynamic Drive Overlay thing that let me overcome the BIOS limitations. But the DDO installed a Bootloader that would often hang the PC upon booting! I had to send in an email to Seagate tech support and wait til the next morning before I could get everything fine and dandy. Now I have a nice healthy 36 Gb of space... almost 20 times as much capacity as the old drive. Sw33t. The only problem now is that the hard drive didn't come with any screws &#8212; so I just placed it on top of the old one. And I had to move my floppy so it's lopsided.",

The Recruit _didn't get as much critical acclaim as _Gangs, but what the heck, Al Pacino in a spy thriller? How could I lose?\r\n\r\nThe story is simple enough. Colin Farell plays James Clayton, a young man just out of MIT, recruited by CIA agent William Burke (Pacino). Clayton is obsessed with finding out what happened to his father, who was lost in an accident some fifteen or so years ago. Pacino taunts him by dropping the occasional hint about his father's fate, and Clayton throws away the promising career he would have had in Engineering to join the CIA. The third entry to this little affair is Leila, Clayton's batchmate at the Farm, a\r\n  \r\nchick who may or may not be a double agent, but definitely has the hots for him. The three of them expectedly get involved a complicated plot involving double agents, unofficial operatives and the standard amount of secret agent sex.\r\n\r\nThe best parts of the movie involve the CIA training. We get a glimpse into the kind of psychological warfare business they teach the recruits at the training centre affectionately called \"The Farm.\" Here Al Pacino does what he does, drilling his principles into his students: \"Trust no one.\"; \"Nothing is what is seems.\", and \"Everything is a test.\"\r\n\r\nThe weakest part has to be the character of James Clayton himself. The character of Leila puts it best: Why the hell does James feel like doing anything he can to please Burke? James never has any real motivation for following Burke like he was the Messiah. Aside from that mysterious star on the CIA wall at Langley (which may or may not be related to his father), there is nothing stopping James from just calling it quits and heading home. Hell, I wouldn't have wanted to go through that training,\r\n  \r\nsecret agent or not.\r\n\r\nOverall: Enjoyable enough, despite the predictability of the overall plot. Ending is a bit disappointing, but only a bit, as it leaves an important plot point hanging. I hope we see these characters again sometime...",

I was invited (under false pretenses I might add) to a seminar trying to sell me to the concept of network markets. It was by a group of people called \"Network 21\" who supposedly have a corporate partner in Amway. Now, don't get me wrong, I have nothing against these people, I'm sure they're enjoying themselves looking for sucke-I mean clients, and convincing them to buy Amway toothpaste and shampoo and vitamins and god-knows-what. I wish them well. What I'm particularly annoyed at is the guy who invited me there, a guy from my university who I don't even know, supposedly to talk about a \"career opportunity.\" Hello!!! I'm an engineer, why the hell would I want to sell toothpaste! \"Oh no,\" he says, \"That was my mistake at first. I thought they were going to tell me to sell door-to-door. All you have to do is refer people to our products.\" \"Excrement!\" I wanted to shout in his face, \"You get paid if you convince people to buy your products? I think that's why it's called selling!\" \"Here, why don't you take this tape before you decide?\", he goes on. \"After all, as an engineer, you can't make a decision without information!\" Yeah right, and let you waste another hour-and-a-half of my life? (In addition to the two hours I had to listen to the talk that is.) \"It's not for me,\" I tell him, not wanting to be rude. \"Why not?\" he persists, \"How can you know if you don't listen to the tape?\" I wanted to smack him around a bit right there and then.\r\n  \r\n    _\"Hello! There's a part of my brain that goes screaming &#8216;Nooooo!!!!' if I don't wanna do something, that's how I know! If I was the type of person who enjoys gathering people and convincing them to buy expensive toothpaste, then that's what I'd be doing.\" _Grrr. I left Megamall quite riled up after that. I had lost two hours, possibly of sleep, and I still had work the next day.\r\n  \r\n    They're lucky I didn't have homicidal tendencies and a gun.\r\n  Yesterday was the anniversary of Philippines Independence. On June 12 1898, Emilio Aguinaldo first raised the Philippine flag at his home in Malolos, Cavite, officially declaring independence from Spain. At that time the Republic of the Philippines, the first such government in Asia, was born. And today is a legal holiday ^_^\r\n  Random linkage: Click here if you enjoy being tortured by puzzles. I'm currently at the second gate. It has annoying BGM though.\r\n  I got a pleasant surprise yesterday. Former members of the FFF, disgusted by the tyrannical ways of a mad dictator banded together to form a new mailing list, inconveniently named the AntiFFF. (Inconvenient because, well, the group would be stuck with that name forever, always living under the shadow of needing to be better than the FFF was. Well, maybe that's a good thing in some ways.) Anyway, they're a fine bunch of guys, the same people who came together at the FFF's peak.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.randomhouse.com/doubleday/davinci/main.html\r\n [2]: http://groups.yahoo.com/Final-Fantasy-Forum\r",

Work is tough right now, as we've got a big deadline coming up in August. I've been putting in 10-12-hour days on a regular basis over the past couple of weeks or so, so I barely have any time to do anything. (Except for a few quick games of [\r\n  \r\n    The Frozen Throne][1] (yay!) before going to bed of course.)\r\n  Of course, the other reason I haven't updated this thing in a fairly long while is that my PC broke down! And since it was past the automatic replacement period, I had to wait for three weeks while PC Express ordered replacement parts. I was irritated at PC Express for most of those three weeks, as being without computer leaves me without a healthy outlet for my stress from work. I'm not bad about the PC having problems per se, I'm fairly sure it's currently impossible to make 100% defect-free electronics. What I'm particularly pissed at was the poor customer service. Their phone lines are almost always busy, their testing of components was not done properly (it was only after they replace the mobo and the power supply that they found out that it was a faulty hard drive that caused the problem, forcing me to have to wait another three weeks for a replacement drive... but I just went out and bought a new one anyway... ) and it's hard to get to them because of their office hours, and... I could go on and on. I guess the distinct disadvantage of buying from cheaper stores is that the customer service is poorer. Or maybe I'm just unlucky. In any case, my next PC will be an Intel one, this time I'll probably buy one of those pre-assembled \"Package\" PCs from a mall outlet, just to have a basis of comparison.\r\n  New mailing list!

For those not from the Philippines, All Saints Day and All Souls Day are non-working holidays for us, and the roads are generally jammed anywhere near cemeteries as Filipinos flock to the graveyards to remember their deceased loved ones. Sadly, since my folks are out of town, and I have no idea how to get to the resting place of my grandparents without them, all I can do is say a prayer for them right here. \\says a silent prayer\\\r\n\r\nAnyway, I bought Temple of Elemental Evil today. I hear it's quite buggy though &#8212; I'll wait for a patch before actually playing it. But installing the game allowed me to make a discovery... I'm low on hard disk space! I'm not sure how it happened, since I believe that a week ago I still had some 15 or more gigs of space available, but earlier I was down to 2 Gb. A quick scan told me that there was no disk error involved &#8212; so I decided to chuck some stuff from the PC. Out went Baldur's Gate (I like the game, but I really can't seem to get myself to play it very often) and Neverwinter Nights (yes, it's infinitely replayable given the available modules, but why play mods when there are new full-length games like ToEE available?) After uninstalling these games and getting rid of some old Naruto eps, I was back up to a still-tight-but-healthy 6 gigs.\r\n\r\nWell, checking out the disk space led to other stuff, so now I'm resigned to spending the rest of the night cleaning up the stuff on the computer, installing new programs, getting rid of old ones, and lots of other general maintenance work.\r\n\r\nChances are I'll be goofing again in a while though.

I like it. But then again, I like anything with a job system and learnable abilities. I find myself excited at the prospect of learning abilities with weird names such as \"Cheap Shot\", \"Initiative\", \"Flametongue\" and \"Silent Samba\"!\r\n\r\nThe game itself has a very \"happy\" feel... the battles are fast-paced and the general mood is upbeat. If you came in looking for a Final Fantasy game, you're gonna be disappointed. The Final Fantasy victory music isn't even there; Yuna jumps across chasms and climbs up ledges at the touch of a button.\r\n\r\nThe battles can be somewhat confusing, given how fast the ATB goes. And between the third and fourth missions (Besaid and Zanarkand), the difficulty seemed to jump up quite a bit. (I actually ran out of MP in Zanarkand and had to skip back to the save point for a refill.). Hopefully it means the rest of the game won't be a walk in the park like some other Final Fantasy games \\\\*coughcoughFF8coughcough\\\\*\r\n\r\nIt was nice seeing Wakka and Lulu, but I was really glad to see the Besaid Aurochs again.! 😛 I remember people complaining about the skimpy clothing and how Rikku is portrayed as a sex object. I don't get that feeling, in fact I don't particularly like the Rikku look, but Yuna looks pretty good.\r\n\r\nAbout the jumping and climbing part... it's kinda weird seeing it in a Final Fantasy game, but I hope they find some clever gameplay uses for it (none so far) The garment grid/dresssphere thing seemed kind of lame, and I'm not particularly fond of the Sailormoon-type costume changing thing, but it's okay, I suppose. I'd turn off the long animations in the options, but I suppose I have to see each change once... \r\n\r\nAnd for those who were worried about Yuna being a pop star... she's not. ^_^",

It's some sort of gaming platform, apparently, but I'm too lazy to go through google and find out more details.\r\n\r\nLost Levels \r\n   \r\n-- covers games that were never made available to the general (well, American at least) public. They have this neat feature about the games that would have been Final Fantasy IV and Seiken Densetsu, but got cancelled; another nice feature is that they've uncovered a preliminary script for what would have been the NES release of the Japanese Final Fantasy 2... neat!\r\n\r\nQuote:\r\n\r\n_\r\n    \r\nI have just three things to teach:\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nSimplicity, patience, compassion.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nThese three are your greatest treasures.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nSimple in actions and in thoughts,\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nYou return to the source of being.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nPatient with both friends and enemies,\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nYou accord with the way things are.\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nCompassionate toward yourself,\r\n    \r\n\r\n    \r\nYou reconcile all beings in the world.\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n_\r\n    \r\n-- Lao Tzu\r\n   \r\n_\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.insertcredit.com\r",

I used the\r\n  \r\nsample ballot at the Eleksyon 2004 website \r\n  \r\nto help me fill up those slots.\r\n\r\nRegarding my choices, the Concilors are all allied with Lakas-CMD, hence they are part of Sonny Belmonte's ticket, who really deserves not only another term but a term with people he's chosen to ally himself with. For president, I chose Roco, &#8216;coz hell, if by some miracle he wins I don't wanna miss my chance to gloat that I voted for the candidate who was right in every possible way. For the party-list rep, last time around I voted for Bayan Muna, but I don't really like how they're soft on the NPA, whether or not the military allegations are true. Akbayan, while still left-leaning (to balance the center-to-right preferences of most mainstream politicians), at least recognizes that the NPA Permit-to-Campaign fees are downright extortion and should be criminalized. For the Senators, the only unusual choice is Doc Hussin (more Muslim representation), but the rest should be obvious. I actually had only 11 senators listed before deciding on Hussin.\r\n\r\nSo what will happen to the country now? Who knows, for a while I was thinking of voting for FPJ just to see what kind of new crap our country can go through... \r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.findprecinct.com\r",

I'm not sure if it's right for me to be talking about the project here, so I won't delve into any specifics. I will however, bore you all with stories from my first trip anywhere remotely far from home.\r\n\r\nFirst, the plane trip. Economy class (excuse me, fiesta class) on a PAL Airbus from NAIA2 to HK International on Thursday night. Food was okay, I've had worse, not really enough to turn me off airline food. The PAL flight attendants, as I later discussed with a male coworker, were quite not-young and, well, not-hot. Heh, probably unfair but you get a certain expectation from media, you know? The flight was short (less than two hours) and uneventful, no dizziness or pukathons for me, thanks, unlike when I take the eight-hour bus ride to Bicol. This may seem boring to seasoned fliers, but I liked that little map that told me at what location we were currently flying over. Neat!\r\n\r\nAs an engineering type, I also took notice of the plane itself. Is it normal that airplanes routinely jiggle and vibrate as the plane taxis? I understand that it's unavoidable as things like cars and trains do the same; but shouldn't things be a bit tighter on a plane? Still, didn't really bother me.\r\n\r\nUpon landing, I got a glimpse of HK International Airport. I had heard it was huge, but didn't get to look around much as I was greeted at the boarding gate by two of the HK staff. Nice people, one of them bought me dinner at McDonald's although I told them I had already had the airline food. Afterwards, they took mo to The Peak, apparently a famous spot for tourists in Hong Kong. It's a mall-type thing on top of a rather high mountain. From the observation deck, you could see most of Hong Kong. From there I could see that Hong Kong was a very urbanized area, a lot more than Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nAfter spending some time there, they drive me to the Staff Quarters near the HK office, where one of our RP staff has been staying for a month. The RP guy greets me, shows me upstairs, shows me the ropes, and I get some sleep.\r\n\r\nThe office building is right next to the block where the staff quarters was, barely a five-minute walk. I spent most of my time in HK between the office and the staff quarters. Truth be told, the trip wasn't really very exciting, as there was a lot of work to be done and not much time to goof around. I'll just note some things particularly interesting about being in a foreign country:\r\n\r\nPeople speaking in an unintelligible language all the time. Probably the biggest hurdle to anything, it took surprisingly little getting used to the fact that I couldn't communicate perfectly with anyone, and with some people, not at all. On some occasions, I had to buy food or drinks through pointing and using hand signs to find out how much stuff was. When walking on the street, I'd turn my head whenever I hear someone speaking English, because it was quite unusual. Also, when dining out with the HK staff, I'd have to rely on them to order for me, since I can't read the menus. Which brings me to... \r\n\r\nForeign food. Anyone who knows me knows I'm quite a picky eater. I don't take to new foods very easily. But it's hard to refuse when you're a guest, so I got to taste more new stuff in my five and a half days in HK than I have for maybe the past three years. It's ok, I don't mind, even the veggies. The biggest problem was the fact that I have no idea how to use chopsticks, and almost every meal needs the use of chopsticks. At one point, I had to badger my co-RP staff to help me get food using the serving chopsticks. While I was there, I had some Taiwanese, Thai food, and of course, Chinese. Lots of Chinese. Oh, and an interesting side note: apparently foreign McDonald's have no McSpaghetti.\r\n\r\n_Religious issues. _I was unable to hear Mass on Sunday. We had to work most of the day, but I got off around 4PM. I asked one of the HK guys for directions to a Church (we were in Kowloon, I believe), but when I explained that I was Catholic, he didn't know what the term meant. (This is of course ridiculous to a Filipino; everbody knows what a _Katoliko _is!) After saying that my faith is similar to another RP staff who he had also met before, he gave me some instructions on where to find a Church. I walked around a bit, following his directions. Which eventually lead me to a Mosque. Ooookay. So I walked around some more (quite a bit actually, went up and down the same road couple of times), I found a place called \"St Andrews Church\", I guessed this was the place he was talking about. I walked in and asked around, found out they had a Mass around 6PM. So I waited for a bit. Around 5:45 I picked up a flier and noticed that it was in fact an Anglican Church (Is it a Protestant thing? Or something else? I'm not entirely sure), and I it's not the same so I went out looking again. I saw another Church, this time it was Lutheran. Around 6:30PM, I gave up, bought some dinner at McDonald's and took a taxi home. The next day one of the HK staff who said he was Christian told me there was a Catholic Church beside the Mosque... apparently it was a small one so I failed to notice it. From our discussion, I think there's quite a distinction here between \"Christians\" and \"Catholics\"; which is weird since I'm fairly sure Catholics are Christian. Anyway, I was wondering why it was so hard to find a Church in a place where... \r\n\r\n_There are so many Filipinos. _You can see 'em everywhere, as you walk along the main streets. Mostly tourists and domestic helpers, I believe. I could hear Tagalog being spoken on the street more often than English. Of course, maybe I should've asked one of them where I could go to Church... \r\n\r\n_Taxis are discplined. _This is of course, shocking to any Filipino! A sticker on the inside of every taxi tells you the rules: They can't turn down fares, they have to issue a receipt when asked, they must follow seatbelt laws, etc. Every taxi is equipped with a receipt machine, and every one of 'em is bright red so they're easy to spot. Overall, while I still experienced traffic jams over there, their traffic situation is still hella lot better than ours.\r\n\r\nWhat else can I say? As I said, I didn't have much free time. They were kind enough to give me half the day off on Tuesday afternoon (my flight home was Tuesday evening), and they recommended some places I could go visit. So I went to Quarry Bay, about 2 MTR stations away from the office. I wasn't sure what I was looking for, though, so I ended up mostly wandering aimlessly, not buying anything &#8216;cept for some food and drinks. I actually managed to walk all the way back to the office, and just decided to buy some chocolates from a supermarket to bring home.\r\n\r\nOn the flight home, PAL switched me to a much smaller plane, which sucked. :( I got to see more of HK Airport, and let me say... it's frickin' huge. I told the guys who brought me to the airport that NAIA2 is like a fourth of HK airport, but now I think it's more like a sixth. I'm told they even have some sort of moving platform thing for people whose gates are so frickin' far. It took 30 minutes for our plane to taxi, that should say something.\r\n\r\nAnyway, got home around 11:30, bought some more goodies at the duty-free shop. Took a taxi home, arrived safe and sound. Told stories for an hour or so, then ...  zzzzzz.\r\n\r",

After having to spend six days in HK (well, more like five-and-a-half, more on that later) and then proceeding to conduct SQL training sessions for the latest batch of recruits, I was kinda tired and stressed out from work. Good thing I had the common sense to file for two days leave after the elections last Monday; don't have to come in 'til tomorrow.\r\n\r\nNot that I'm using the free time for anything sensible mind you. In fact, most people would probably consider it a serious waste of vacation leave. But hey, I like to goof off! In between Warcraft III sessions, random internet surfing, constant reloading of the Inquirer website (to see the latest Namfrel quick-count figures of course), and reading through a couple of CDs worth of comics copied from Mon last Monday, I did manage to clean up my room somewhat.\r\n\r\nI really only wanted to clean up &#8216;coz I wanted to read the Street Fighter comics and couldn't find them. I was only able to find the two most recent issues though. One other thing I wanted to do was to seriously clean up the crap on this computer. We're quite low on disk space, and more than half of my desktop is cluttered with icons, and Alvin tells me we have far too many MP3s on disk.\r\n\r\nI've downloaded some Java code that will help me extract ID3 data from MP3 files. I'm hoping to use it to properly catalog all the MP3s on disk, assuming I get unlazy enough.\r\n\r\nHeh, while I was Mon's place, he made the brilliant observation that practically everything we do is fueled by how lazy (or unlazy) we are at any time... \r\n\r\n [1]: http://battle.net/war3\r",

If you're not aware of Naruto, it's pretty much like Dragonball Z, except with better animation, actual reasons for fighting, and ninjas instead of aliens. It tells the story of a young boy in the Hidden Village of Konoha, cursed with being the living incarnation of a feared nine-tailed demon fox spirit. Simple enough eh? \r\n\r\nThe game itself is cool; it's one-on-one fighting featuring characters from the anime/manga. Not fighting like Street Fighter fighting mind you, but fighting in an interactive environment, with items to be picked up, things to be destroyed, support characters to be called upon, and mighty cinematic ougis do be performed. If you've ever seen the Powerstone game in the arcades, it's a bit similar, and this is how I imagine Super Smash Bros. Melee would be like. The graphics are okay; not the best cel-shading I've seen, but definitely good for the material. You're restricted to 2d movement, but each stage has two layers, and each layer has various ropes, balconies, trees or whatnot that act as platforms. Most of the moves are available to all characters: punches, kicks, button-mashing combos, launchers, knockdowns, jutsus, counters (using the \"transform into a log\" technique), shurikens, kunai, surprise attacks from your allies, etc. Each character has three levels of ougi moves; when you connect with an ougi move, the view shifts to a cutscene-style depiction of the character doing their ougi on the hapless opponent. The opponent isn't helpless however; both players are given a sequence of button commands to push. If the attacker does it right and finishes before the opponent, he gets to do more damage and proceeds to the next part of the ougi. Since the ougis deal a huge (usually decisive) amount of damage, the defender usually wanys to do finish his sequence faster to greatly lessen the damage. \r\n\r\nThe only problem with this game is the lack of characters: Six are available at the start (Naruto, Sakura, Sasuke, Kakashi, Shikamaru and Rock Lee), and six more can be unlocked (Neji, Hinata, Haku, Zabuza, Gaara and Orochimaru); most of the other characters appear in ougis, as support characters or simply as stage backgrounds (you can hit them when you see them on the screen!) There's a lot of other things to unlock though: BGMs, voices, pictures, action figures, songs, video clips of each ougi, etc. \r\n\r\nI'd recommend it for anyone who's a fan of videogames and the Naruto series.",

Heaven knows it's a lot more entertaining than Philippine politics.\r\n\r\nReminds me of something a friend and I talked about the other day. Since we're obviously not doing so well with elections, we should have a new way of choosing our leaders: trial-by-combat! A DBZ-style fighting tournament (probably at the Araneta Coliseum) to determine who will be the next leader! Hey, at least it would be more entertaining, and FPJ would probably have a much better chance, unless he faces someone like Sonny Parsons\r\n\r",

The whole world knows by now that the Philippine government has capitulated (or intends to, at least) to the demands of terrorists kidnappers holding Filipino truck driver Angelo dela Cruz hostage.\r\n\r\nEven Jay Leno took his shots at our country, with the following quote from opening monologue of Wednesday night, July 14, 2004:\r\n\r\n For the 2nd time in the past few days, a new world record has been set in the 100 meter dash. It was set by Filipino troops fleeing Iraq.\r\n\r\nEven more embarassing, I would think, was the overreaction of local leftist/militant groups, demanding an apology from Leno, accusing him of being a \"swashbuckling apologist\" for George W. Bush.\r\n\r\nNevermind the fact that Leno, Letterman, O'Brien and other late night talk show hosts continually rail on Dubya and their other &#8216;respectable' politicians whenever they find an opportunity to do so; these guys don't even apologize to George W.

Whatever ridicule we get from international media, whatever spite we get from our \"allies\", I can't deny we deserve it.\r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong; of course I wish Angelo dela Cruz gets out of this mess safely, I wish him no harm. But it isn't a simple open-and-shut case of trading our troop positions for the life of one man. By giving in, we surrender our principles, we say to the world: Just abduct a Filipino and you have an entire nation at your command! This is my beef, my gripe, I don't really care about the politics of the situation, whether RP is being a US lapdog or whatnot; All I know is that it's suddenly becomes very profitable for terrorists to kidnap Filipinos.\r\n\r\nNo matter what \"War on Terrorism\" rhetoric you spout, or whether you are against \"US imperialism\" or not, it should be obvious that terrorism threatens our way of life. You may think that it's not a big deal; our troop commitments in Iraq are pratically insignificant anyway, it's a small price to pay; But what if the next time fanatics decide to abduct a Filipino, they demand more than just a troop pullout? What if they demand that we trade one life for another? What if they demand the complete surrender to the Muslim separatists? Would we give in then? To save the life of one man?\r\n\r\nGranted, having to weigh the life of one man against the interests of a nation is a terrible burden to bear, a decision I would not want to take upon myself, so I can understand why the government chooses to capitualte. I can only hope that if, God forbid, I am ever placed in a similar situation where an entire nation would have to throw away principles just to save my life, I would be willing to defiantly announce that I should be sacrificed for the greater good. I'm not judging Angelo dela Cruz; I don't know much about the man aside from the fact that he's a truck driver in Iraq and that he'll likely receive a heroes' welcome for simply being in the wrong place at the wrong time.\r\n\r\nThis is a terrible blow to us as a nation, as a people. And Angelo dela Cruz, should his life be saved, had damn better well live a good and fruitful life, because we have a paid a high price for it.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://philstar.com/philstar/News200407180401.htm\r",

You be the judge!\r\n  I was bored, and wanted something to happen with this blog, so I decided to submit it to Rice Bowl Journals... it's some sort of community for webloggers of Asian descent. I'm of Asian descent, right?\r\n  I have some gmail invites. Ask me for one if you're interested, even if I don't know you, for some reason (maybe I'll talk about it in the next post, even), I feel like making friends. (Where to ask?

I don't talk about these things that often, but hey, what use is a blog if you can't use it as an outlet, right?\r\n\r\nI'm in love. Yup, I am. Whereas I previously considered myself as someone strong enough to be emotionally independent from other people, I find myself now thinking about a certain person constantly, worried about how she is, having my mood depend on how she interacts with me, and generally acting quite nervously around her. I won't mention her name, but I will say I've known her for a bit of time now, and it took me a while to reconcile the desires of my heart and the objections of my mind; but today I am sure: I love her.\r\n\r\nThis sort of thing is really not my style, I normally don't like to speak of romantic ideals or anything, so I'll cut to the chase. She knows, I told her. And her response? Well, it was less than what I wanted, but more than I expected. In her own words: \"I'm not closing any doors on you, but I'm not leaving any windows open either.\" She wants us to be friends, she doesn't want me to court her, she says if she feels something for me somewhere along the way, then that's it; if not, then too bad.\r\n\r\nNow, I'm generally stupid about this sort of thing myself, so to be honest, I have no idea how to proceed. I want to pursue something with her, but for now, I really have no choice but to settle for building a friendship and hope that fate gives me a chance some day. (It seems I have a tendency to rely on fate for such things... )\r\n\r\nI guess the main reason I'm blogging this is that I realize it's brought about a change in my life... and I want to remember it. I want to remember that this is the time I changed, and that she was the reason why.\r\n\r\nHow did I change? For one thing, I seem to have gotten back a whole lot friendlier, and also a whole lot moodier. She brought out my gloomy side again -- the side of me that's logical and analytical. He seldom needs to come out because I can usually rely on my normal self to handle things. But this whole issue with her &#8212; I have no idea how to handle it, so gloomy side comes out. Except he has no idea what to do either. It isn't exactly a problem well-suited to logical analysis, and it frustrates me so much that something I feel so strongly about could be so out of my control.\r\n\r\nTwo things have happened as a result of this, basically: one, I'm more open to people now; and two, I spent some time thinking about love and life, and my life in general, where I want to go and what I want to do. I think I learned a lot about myself; maybe I'll write about it one of these days.\r\n\r\nFor now, I just want to remember that she is the reason I'm feeling this way...",

Read the question once or twice, and you realize that either (a) you already know the answer, (b) you will never know the answer or (c) you think you know the answer, but you'll need time to remember it. For most questions, it should be either (a) or (b), because you should be aware of the scope of what you have studied. For (c), well, I guess I'm unique here, because instead of taking time to actually think about what the right answer would be, I just go with my gut and pick a likely answer! (I said I was fast, not accurate :P)\r\n\r\nOh, and the JITSE itself? A tip to anyone who might want to take it: Don't bother with those five thick reviewer books they give you. Just go through a couple of years worth of sample exams and you'll be fine.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.jitse.org/\r\n [2]: http://www.pcu.edu.ph/\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Anonymous on 2005-10-23 01:10:00 +0000\r\ntrust me ...  you'll regret NOT reading those books.

I would recommend that you check out some of the sample exams\r\n  \r\nor past exams (there should be some that are downloadable from the jitse\r\n  \r\nwebsite I think), as these should help you greatly. The scope of the exam is\r\n  \r\nrather wide, I understand it covers a lot of Computer Science stuff (I'm no\r\n  \r\nComSci grad so I don't know how accurate that is), there were questions on\r\n  \r\nterminology, algorithms, software engineering concepts, etc.",

So I took a taxi, just outside Megamall. The driver had to ask me where I was going, and luckily my choice of destination was favorable to him. Now, to be honest, I really hate taxi drivers who choose passengers based on where they're going. Not only is it illegal, it's annoying. So I didn't really like it when he turned out to be a chatty driver.\r\n\r\nOn our way down East Avenue, near the LTO offices, he told me how he had spent the whole day there yesterday to get his taximeter calibrated. Now, the government recently declared an increase in taxi fares, so taxis have been lined up in droves along East Avenue for days now.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, I found myself interested. He told me about how he was there since 5 in the AM, sleeping in his taxi (apprently a new one, or so he said) He told me about how the chairman (of what exactly, I'm not sure) didn't know anything about cars and had to call a senior citizen employee to help her sort it out. She didn't know much, he said, but she had guts. She stuck to it all day, stopping only to eat, making sure everything was in order, enduring the verbal abuse of the taxi drivers.\r\n\r\nHe said he was impressed with her, a diminutive woman in her late thirties, a bit attractive, apparently single. She hunched when she sat down, but when she walked, she stood tall -- she knew how to carry herself. She was new to the office, he said, but she was eager to learn and she meant well.\r\n\r\nHe was a good storyteller, relishing the details of his story, I wish I could do it justice. I came away impressed, and not a bit ashamed. I was ready to dismiss him as another nobody, someone who couldn't learn anything in life but how to drive a car. But the way he spoke, the words he used, they spoke of a subtle intelligence, a stoic understanding of events around him.\r\n\r\nI should chat with taxi drivers more often.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Anonymous on 2004-11-05 23:34:00 +0000\r\nCabbie stories are the second reason for me to ride shotgun. First is so I can\r\n  \r\npractice some self-defense if need be, and third is so I can figure out\r\n  \r\nexactly where the wrong turn was made.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2004-11-06 02:06:00 +0000\r\nI wanted to smite you for posting anonymously, especially since I know who you\r\n  \r\nare. But I just realized blogger comments don't allow people to leave a name\r\n  \r\nor email address. It's a bit primitive. I'd get another commenting system, but\r\n  \r\nI'm too lazy, and if I find some time I'll probably code one myself. 😀",

You start to notice this certain person. You find her sweet and friendly. You like the way she looks, the way she talks, the way she smiles. She's pretty cute, she's smart, and her smile is enough to melt your heart. You hang out with her every so often. You find something about her that turns you on. Pretty soon you find yourself thinking about her more than usual.\r\n\r\nWhat is it about her that has your interest? You're not sure. You don't even know her that well. She's not the type of person you always thought you'd fall for. She's not a super-beautiful hot babe. She doesn't give any special indication that she's even remotely interested. But your heart doesn't give a damn, you love her anyway.\r\n\r\nYou start to worry about how you're feeling. You wonder whether you should try to get close. Or maybe you should be upfront and tell her how you feel. You agonize for weeks; all the words left unsaid, swimming around in your head, yearning for release. You want to be careful. But you want to shout your love from the rooftops.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter. In a moment of weakness, it comes out. Your first mistake. You tell her how you feel. Verbally, by SMS, by email, by chat, by hand-written note, it doesn't matter. It all starts coming out. Like a fool, you pour your heart out, believing that your love for her is enough; enough for her to give you a chance.\r\n\r\nNo such luck. She won't even consider it. She can only be your friend she says. You walk away, sad, shattered, dejected, not knowing what to do. It rips away your heart, the fact that you love her so much, you feel so strongly for her, yet she cannot return even a fraction of the intensity of your emotion. You feel so helpless, so powerless over this situation that means the world to you.\r\n\r\nYou ask yourself what went wrong. Did you say something stupid, did you do anything wrong, did you blow it? No, she says, there's nothing wrong with you, it's me. Bullshit, you say to yourself.\r\n\r\nYou try to keep on hanging out with her, to be her friend, as she says. But you can't . Every moment you spend with her is infinity of torture. You want to speak out, tell her how you feel, remind her that there's someone loving her. Seeing her is pure agony. In yet another moment of weakness, you make your second mistake. You tell her you still love her, you tell her you're still there.\r\n\r\nShe refuses to talk about it; she says she doesn't want to feel the guilt. Damnit! You blame yourself, asking why you always say the wrong things at the wrong time.\r\n\r\nSoon, things become awkward between the two of you, and you drift apart. You see her everyday, but you barely talk. You still feel the same way, but you can't even comfortably spend time with her anymore.\r\n\r\nYou tell yourself that you should just try to be her friend. You bottle up your feelings, try to set them aside. They eat away at your heart, tear apart your soul. Running into her becomes a double-edged sword; you're glad to see the smile on her face, but you're saddened by the awkward silence that exists between you.\r\n\r\nYou start to question yourself. You start to ask God what you did to deserve this sort of pain. Are you really so unattractive, so unremarkable, that the girl of your dreams won't even consider you? Was it really too much to hope that this girl could at least look beyond your outer shell and try to get to know the real you?\r\n\r\nYou start to doubt the girl you fell in love with. Maybe she wasn't as nice as you once thought? Maybe she's an evil, heartless bitch? Maybe she's no more special than you are, maybe you've put her up on a pedestal, and maybe you'd just be disappointed if the reality did not match your expectations? Is she really worth all this pain?\r\n\r\nYou start to think about how you feel. Are you really in love with her? Or do you just want her because you can't have her? Are you in love with the real her, not just some made-up idea of her?\r\n\r\n\"This is madness!\" you finally conclude. \"There has to be more to life than this...  Why should I waste so much of my time and energy pining over this woman, a woman who will probably never even consider me, a woman whom I'm not even sure why I'm attracted to?\" You come to a decision. You will get rid of these feelings, these emotions; push them away to some dark corner of your soul and leave them to rot.\r\n\r\nAnd you do it. It pains your heart to do so, but you start to avoid her. You don't talk to her unless you need to. Whenever you think of her, you throw yourself into your work, your hobbies, your friends, anything to rid your mind of her lingering presence. You do what it takes. You pull out that part of your heart that remembers her smile, and you bury it inside, deep inside, so that you may never feel those painful emotions again. You kill that part of your soul that knows how to love and how to live.\r\n\r\nIt is living pain and torture, but eventually you manage to do it. You manage to regain control of your mind, heart and soul. You're finally at peace. All is right with the world.\r\n\r\nAnd then you see her again.\r\n\r\nShe greets you, talks to you, compliments you, smiles at you. And suddenly all your hard work fades away. Your world is no longer your own. You're falling in love, all over again.\r\n\r\nYou recognize it, and you accept it. You are able to survive, because somehow, through all those moments of pain, heartbreak and despair, a light shines through. Every so often, you manage to get some time to sit with her, talk to her, see her smile. And those moments, while very rare, are also very precious. Those moments are pure, unadulterated bliss, and you wish there was a way to make them last forever. They are no more than fleeting instants between oceans of pain, but somehow, those few moments are enough to make all of the loneliness worthwhile... \r\n\r\nAnd the cruel, vicious cycle repeats itself...",

I now think company-sponsored health care is cool :D) at Clinica Manila in Megamall. After some blood tests and stuff, I found out some bad things:\r\n\r\n  I have too much uric acid in my system. Apparently I have to avoid beans, canned goods, wine, shellfish, etc. The weird thing is, I don't even eat most of this stuff! (Except maybe canned foods -- I eat Spam regularly :D)\r\n  I'm suffering from hyperthyroidism. I'm not sure what it means, except that my thyroid is too eager to do it's job, so it's giving me some sort of fast metabolism or something. Apparently I should be experiencing dizziness (yes), palpitations (uh... no), shakiness of the hands (some), and possibly rapid weight loss (haha, not likely... )\r\n  My sinuses are clogged up. Now I have to take some nasal spray or something.\r\n  And some other stuff I don't want to talk about 😀\r\n\r\nNothing too serious I guess, but I am seriously getting tired of waiting for doctors! Last Friday, I had to wait in the (cold, cold, cold) waiting corrider of Clinica Manila for more than two hours!!! Lost half-a-day's work time, I did. Luckily, (or unluckily, maybe) I had Neil Stephenson's Cryptonomicon handy. I only killed some 150+ pages in those two hours though, which says a lot about my opinion on his writing/pacing.\r\n\r\nLast Monday, I also spent some 45 minutes in a big tube thingy, with some 5-minute periods of not being allowed to swallow (ye gods that was hard!)...  it was a thyroid scan at the new Medical City on Ortigas Avenue. Nice place, very spiffy. Has a Starbucks.",

And I actually started reading it about a month and a half earlier.\r\n\r\nIn a word, the book is wordy. Stephenson has a lot to say, and it takes him 1100+ pages to do it, whereas if I were writing this story (or weird amalgamation of stories, such as it is), I would probably do it in around half that amount.\r\n\r\nThere are two stories actually, not three as the book's back cover suggests. But those two stories actually start off in around fifty separate threads that start to come together only halfway through the book. This is one of the reasons why it took me a month and a half to get through the first half of the book; once the plot started to get going, everything went a bit faster.\r\n\r\nCryptonomicon is basically about a slick hacker-type dude named Randall Waterhouse, or Randy for short. While reading this book, whenever Randy's name is mentioned, I always visualize young Randy Orton, legend-killer and youngest ever WWE champion. This is the second reason why I was able to read the second half faster. Once I started to imagine it was Randy Orton, there was always the possibility of a book-ending RKO in the next page! Anyway, the first (and main) story arc is about young Randy's involvement in an ambitious startup setting up operations in Southeast Asia. Lots of stuff about finance, cryptography and politics finds its way into young Randy's story.\r\n\r\nThe secondary story arc is about World War II. Unlike the modern-day Randy storyline however, this one has more than one main player, so the WWII story is a lot more fragmented. The most important players are Lawrence Waterhouse (Randy's grandpa), who works for the Allies as a top-notch codebreaker, boasting such friends as the famous (to computer geeks at least) Alan Turing; Bobby Shaftoe, a US marine who seems to have accomplished more during the war than Douglas McArthur himself; and finally Goto Dengo, a Japanese miner whose role in the story is not readily apparent until the halfway mark. (A lot of things improve around the halfway mark.)\r\n\r\nNow, here's the main problem with the novel. There are all these POVs, and it jumps around a lot, so there's a tendency to get confused, and every so often Stephenson pulls out a chapter that doesn't have anything to do with any of the earlier chapters, so you're like \"Crap! Another subplot I have to keep track of!\"\r\n\r\nBut I digress. And so does Stephenson. Not only do the POVs jump around between chapters, but each chapter is liberally interspersed with a short discussion of the weather, Asian cultures, corruption at the NAIA, cryptography, mathematical analysis of horniness, military idiosyncrasies and a bajillion other topics; enterprising high school students looking for a term paper could simply copy one of the book's chapters, find-and-replace some names, and get at least a B. Normally it's okay, but there's simply a lot of stray tangents in this book, and not all of them I found interesting, and were simply glossed over. Not surprisingly, I liked the parts about cryptography.\r\n\r\nI really hated this book at the start, as I found it a very hard read, but after I got past the halfway mark it got a lot easier. I guess my main problem with the start was I had no idea why all these random, seemingly unrelated subplots were coming out; I wasn't sure if there was a point and it was all going to come together later, or Stephenson just lets his mind wander. Luckily, it did all come together later, in a somewhat plausible way.\r\n\r\nAll-in-all, the book is okay, but I wouldn't recommend it to a non-geek, or to someone faint of heart.\r\n\r\nYes, that was a short review. 😀",

When I was there, I was mentally comparing it to the UP Diliman campus. Main reason being, we had a tendency to walk everywhere we went. Just like in UP, everything was literally within \"walking distance\" -- the beach, the church, the cemetary, etc. So in my mind, the UP Diliman campus and Daet, Camarines Norte occupy roughly the same area, even though technically, one is a university campus and the other a full-sized town. (On a tangent, the transportation within Daet is strictly limited to tricycles only, which would imply it being logically smaller than UPD, which has jeepneys.)\r\n\r\nSo, anyway, there was a lot of walking going on. We walked everywhere. Ocassionally, I would get to walk with my father. My dad, he's basically a nice guy. It's always nice to see that while we're walking around town, he has to stop and chat with somebody in every other store. Daet has lots of these little stores, side-by-side in the residential areas: hardware stores, bakeries, general merchandise, etc. And my dad seems to know someone and has to exchange tales of how things have been going, hey-have-you-met-my-son-can-you-find-him-a-girlfriend, that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nNow, maybe this sort of thing isn't that irregular, why do I bother talking about it? After all, my father grew up in this town, it's to be expected that he knows people all over the place, right? Not to me. I mean, growing up I knew a small part of Quezon City, but I was never that chummy with that many people. I guess it's just a small town thing that never fails to amaze me: Everybody seems to know everybody else.\r\n\r\nAnother thing about my dad that occasionally surprises me: he's a story-teller. Like I said, whenever he meets one of these everyday people-on-the-street types, he spends a few minutes chatting with them. Those few minutes are invariably filled with some short story (only occasionally mildly exaggerated) about how his sons have jobs now, how things were when he worked overseas, what happened to his long-lost cousins, etc. When I watch him talking like this to long-lost friends and the occasional relative-whose-name-I-should-probably remember, I am quite a bit envious. I want to be like that, I want to be able to spout out interesting anecdotes on demand, I want to be able to grab people's attentions with my words.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, unlike my dad, I don't have much life experience to speak about. I haven't been to that many places, haven't done that many interesting things. I guess I really need to get out more...",

I'll read most anything. Books, comics, magazines, newspapers, leaflets, articles, essays. Well, anything well-written at least. When I first got access to the Internet, I was overjoyed. \"Wow! Lots of stuff to read!\" And I read a lot online. I started mostly with anime fanfiction, but pretty soon I enjoyed reading discussions on mailing-lists, message boards, news sites, etc. The internet is a treasure trove for one who always strives for information. But I digress, this post is not about the wondrous internet.\r\n\r\nIt's about the fact that I like to read. In particular, I like to read books. In fact, I thought about posting something like this because I was looking for a particular book. Specifically, the Wastelands, third book of Stephen King's Dark Tower series. And I don't want just any copy, I want a copy in the same series as the first two books I already have. I've looked through several National Bookstore branches already, but have yet to find one. I know they used to have a copy at the SM North Edsa branch, since that's where I bought the second book Drawing of the Three. However, I can't find it there; it seems that branch is under renovation, maybe I'm just too confused at the change in layout. The salespeople don't seem to be much help either. \"Stephen King? Try the horror section.\" That would be great except Dark Tower is not a horror series!\r\n\r\nBut I digress again. Back to the topic. I like to read. I like to read books. The internet sort of changed that. After I first got internet access, I seldom read books for a period of time, meaning most of my college years. In fact, I think the only series of books I was able to follow during my college years was Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series. (Short review? Started out okay, then got silly, then got annoying. Serious milking cow.)\r\n\r\nAfter I started working, I had a source of income. (Wow, what a deep and non-obvious statement!) Given this, I was able to start reading again, not only by borrowing from friends (Hi Dave, Mike!), but this time I was able to buy the occasional book myself. So I've been trying to catch up. Sadly, I think the years of reading lots of stuff online has tarnished my reading skills. I still read far, far quicker than most people, but it takes me ages to finish a single book. nowadays. I'm currently reading Neil Gaiman's American Gods; I started about a week agao, but I'm not even a fifth of the way in! It's not that it's a bad book, it's okay, in Gaiman's usual way, but I think it's because there are a lot more distractions in my life nowadays (work, love or lack of it, video games, blogging); When I was young I was able to read a lot because whenever I had free time I would curl up with a good book. These days however, I find that whatever free time I have, I prefer to spend it in quiet _muni-muni _instead of having to use my brainpower to go through a potentially difficult book (thanks, Cryptonomicon!)\r\n\r\nI also want to read more non-fiction, autobiographies and stuff. But I find that such books are usually more expensive than normal paperback novels, and I don't know who I can borrow such from.\r\n\r\nAnyway, what's the point of this post? I like to read. And I want to read more. That is all.",

And I'm going to get my gaming groove on! I got a new copy of Star Ocean: Til The End of Time, hopefully this one's a good copy, I haven't tested it yet.

And, as expected when one makes such a gargantuan mistake, the Sea was aware of my folly. It sent its minions, one after another, to take my precious away from me. Again and again I bore their onslaught, as wave after wave came after me, yearning to knock me off my feet loosely planted upon the sandy earth some four and a half feet below water level. Finally, weary of the long battle, the Sea summons all its might. I did not see it coming, for my back was turned and I was celebrating my recent victories thinking the worst was over. I suddenly became aware of my 12-year-old adopted cousin looking behind me in abject horror. A gigantic wave had arisen out of nowhere, the only warning being the looming shadow that came at me from behind. I had no time to prepare for this savage assault, and the Mother of all Waves came upon me with all her might, finally knocking this proud yet weary warrior off his feet. I felt myself tumble underwater, my trunks almost torn off me in the fury of the crashing water. I reached out my arms in desperation, and my hands struck wet sand, letting me know in what direction to raise my head. When I finally surfaced again, my eyeglasses were gone, I had lost the battle. My eyeglasses belong to the Sea now.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Ari on 2004-11-03 19:10:00 +0000\r\nI enjoyed this lol.

Even though he was able to quote from many other bands, books, and even a separate Radiohead album for free. Even he had personally met the band before, and had freely let them quote his own works in their concerts. Gives a good idea of how fucked-up the worldwide copyright system is. And reminds me why I prefer to just ignore the whole corporate copyright system. (Never mind that it's quite convenient to do so.)\r\n\r\nOn that note, I wonder if local band Parokya ni Edgar had to cough up for their parody of Radiohead's \"Creep\" (I forget what the actual Parokya track title was.)\r\n\r\nApparently, even posting song lyrics online is illegal, btw. Or at least according to copyright lawyers. I'd think that the band Radiohead itself wouldn't mind these things which supposedly infringe on their copyrights, but of course, the corporate structure which they play under would not stand for it. Maybe the world would be far better off if copyright protections were limited to individuals and not corporations? In the modern-day world of the internet, there's really no need for large recording companies any more, they are just large dinosaurs who refuse to admit the coming ice age.\r\n\r\nActually, now that I think about it, I have seldom actually paid for music before. When I was in HS, I sometimes (rarely) bought cassettes. As for CDs (audio CDs I mean), I have _never _bought any audio CDs, pirated or otherwise. Most of the time, I would indulge myself by listening to FM radio or music videos. The downside of this, of course, was that my musical selection was limited to what the big recording companies deemed important enough to promote.\r\n\r\nThese days, with MP3s, my selection is a lot more varied, since I get to pick and sample more music via P2P downloading. I don't even listen to radio anymore, at least not intentionally. I pick up new songs by hearing about them from friends or over the internet. Whenever I'm listening to a new band, I never know if they're popular or not. I recently started to enjoy Dashboard Confessional; I liked Vindicated when I first heard the Spiderman 2 OST. I didn't need the confirmation of public radio (which came about two weeks after I got my hands on 3 full DC albums) to know I liked the song, and the band. My playlist these days is mostly populated by Dashboard Confessional, Matchbox Twenty, Gin Blossoms, Switchfoot, Rivermaya, Sponge Cola, Sugarfree, Bamboo, Maroon 5, Counting Crows, Better Than Ezra, Live, Coldplay, Lifehouse etc. Not exactly on the leading edge of popular music, but at least I picked up thse bands by myself without relying on recording companies jamming them down my throat.\r\n\r\nThis rambling post was brought to you by the letter N.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.planetsimpson.com/radiohead.aspx\r",

I finished the last 1/3rd during a 15-minute bathroom break back home. It was a short book. Lots of people have raved about how good it is. What do I think? It's okay, but nothing overly special. Maybe I didn't get too much of it because it didn't have much new material for me. All of this -- having your own \"personal legend\"; searching and/or fighting for it instead of deciding to accept and be content with you have; communicating with the \"Soul of the World\"; &#8212; most of these things are not foreign concepts to me. I think the book would appeal most to those who are feeling a bit down or lost, and looking for something inspirational to give them a slight push and help them find their way. Or something. 😀\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting things presented in the book is the concept of \"beginner's luck\". Basically the book says that the universe conspires to make your personal legend come true, because of this, when you're starting out on something, the universe will give you a small taste of success, so you're enticed to follow-up. I guess I've never heard of beginner's luck described this way before.\r\n\r\nThe book also talks about how most people will disregarding their personal dreams to settle for whatever contentment comes their way in life. Personally, I think I'm the sort to prefer to go out and learn new things, or strive to make things better than to just be satisfied doing the same thing day in and day out. In fact, that's one of the things I like about my current job: things often stay interesting. I'm almost always learning something new, or doing something different. The only times I don't like my job are when I have to do something similar repeatedly for some time period, that's when I entertain thoughts of quitting. (No real plans though, not anytime soon at least.)\r\n\r\nOne of officemates describes me as having a strong personality, and also as someone who wants to live an exciting life. The problem with that however, is that I'm also quite lazy. So, I'm easily bored and I'm also lazy. Quite a paradox... I like to experience new things, but I also like to spend a lot of time by myself mulling over different things (or sometimes the same thing over and over... )\r\n\r\nMan, that was a random rambling post if I ever saw one.

With games often serving as pioneers into new frontiers, I believe this is merely signifying the trend of software products transforming into services instead of commodities.\r\n\r\nAnyway, what I mean to say is, I've been spending quite some time with web-based games lately. Mostly it's the fantastic and funny web-based parody RPG Kingdom of Loathing, which I've mentioned before. After a brief respite, I'm getting into this game again, having started dabbling with PvP, playing (or trying to play) the market, and going after the quests I haven't finished yet.\r\n\r\nAnother online game I found lately is the totally addictive time-waster gridlock, apparently a port of an existing puzzle game. It's moderately challenging; it took me two days (not continuously, of course) to finish the 40 levels.\r\n\r\nAnd just to show how much free time people have on your hands, just now I found that someone has managed to create an entire Lemmings game written in JavaScript! \r\n\r\nI think it's also great that all three of these games work well with Firefox, without me having to install any silly extensions.

I work as an engineer, remodelling space shuttles so that they don't crash and burn on reentry. I play the piano, the trombone and the harmonica. I am a columnist for an internationally acclaimed newspaper. I produce and direct award-winning movies. To relax, I write full-length novels, solve transcendental math problems and practice karate, taekwondo and aikido.\r\n\r\nI save people from drowning, I protect children from danger, I patrol the streets for litterbugs and jaywalkers, I go to government offices and streamline their processes. I hunt down terrorists, I foil coup attempts, I dismantle nuclear weaponry. I feed the hungry and visit the sick. I write the software that hunts down viruses and protects the internet. I wage war against poverty and take down corrupt politicians. I am wanted in thirty-one states and outlawed in fifty countries.\r\n\r\nI sew clothes for orphans, I bake cookies for prisoners of war, I read stories to the terminally ill. I have read the Bible, the Iliad, and the works of Shakespeare, all in one sitting. I have memorized the streets of New York, Madrid, Egypt, Beijing and Manila. I served in covert operations in Vietnam and Desert Storm. I have set up research centers to determine the cure for cancer and the secret of immortality. I am never late, I do my taxes months ahead of schedule, I can recite Pi up to the 2000th digit. I never sleep, I cannot be surprised, I make the most of my time.\r\n\r\nI stare death in the eye. I bungee jump, I skateboard off high cliffs, I eat Akane Tendo's cooking. I clean up oil spills, I round up lost dogs, I play Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. I have defeated the evil witch, rescued the princess and single-handedly defended the Earth from an alien invasion, armed with nothing more than a swiss knife and duct tape.\r\n\r\nI am a conqueror, I have defeated armies and destroyed nations. I am a lover, I have wooed a hundred women. I am an artist, I have painted murals in every city and written songs in every language. I am a scientist, I have defied and disproven the laws of physics. I am an athlete, I have won twenty gold medals in the last three olympics. I am a spiritualist, I have uncovered the meaning of life yet chose to keep it hidden.\r\n\r\nI am a man of myth and legend, tales of my exploits abound in the darker areas of the night. I am a man of the world, journeying to many places to seek out fame and fortune, protect the innocent and for great justice. I walk my own way, I seek my own truth, I determine my own fate. I stand tall and shake the heavens. When I move, the crowds give way to let me pass. When I speak, the world stops to listen. When I shout, the universe holds its breath.\r\n\r\nI am nature's greatest miracle. I am the one foretold by legend, whose coming will be the beginning and the end. Prophets and sages speak my name in whispers, beasts of the jungle scatter when I approach, kings and presidents tremble in my presence, yet children come to me and adore me. I will incite war and destruction, and I will unite all nations under my wing. I am anger, I am fear, I am madness. I am light and shadow, I am order and chaos, I am life and death. I am judge, jury and executioner. I am your greatest dream. I am your worst nightmare. I am your finest hour. I am your darkest day.

Times to be free from work and stress, to indulge in things I like to do. I've just realized that Christmas is a rather stressful season.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, there's the multitude of Christmas gatherings one has to attend. With family. With relatives. With friends. With friends of family. With coworkers. With coworkers who are friends. It's not that I don't enjoy myself at these gatherings mind you. In fact, lately I've found myself enjoying the company of other people more. It's just that I'm not yet an entirely social person, and too many social gatherings too soon somewhat stretches the limits of my comfort zone.\r\n\r\nChristmas is stressful. Everyone is busy, busy, busy. Going from place to place apparently, as the traffic has been horrible lately, with jams stretching well into the early morning.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of early morning, I left work close to midnight last night. We've been in crunch mode for the past two weeks or so, what with multiple deadlines coming up in January. Not that I can't handle of course. But it doesn't help that every other developer in one of my projects is going to be on vacation next week. Since I've had to run on pure genius these past few days, and as side effect, I was often more loud, sarcastic and smarmy than usual. To anyone who was annoyed by this, I apologize.\r\n\r\nAnd the highlight of my last day of work before Christmas? Sometime before dinner I wrote a love letter and sent it by email to her. Nothing much, just telling her some things I wanted her to know, and greeting her for the holidays and stuff. I wasn't expecting anything back, but I guess I got lucky. A few minutes before I left the office, I got a jabber message from her. To paraphrase:\r\n\r\n preher: boo!\r\nher: thanks for the lovely letter :)\r\nme: I'm glad you liked it. my christmas is complete :)\r\n/pre\r\n\r\nThere was more of course, a small exchange of pleasantries and even more holiday greetings. But I got that warm, fuzzy feeling again. Maybe Christmas this year wasn't so bad after all. =)\r\n\r\nHappy Holidays!\r\n\r",

Deadlines to catch up with at the start of the next year meant crunch time for most of the past two weeks. So, for my first blog post on my first rest day in a while, I'll bring home some work.\r\n\r\nI have a problem with Excel. I'm writing a web app that generates HTML files which are exported to Excel. In most cases, it's easy, I just follow the template generated by using Excel-File-Save As-HTML\r\n\r\nHowever, I've encountered a problem. One of my reports needs to show two tables side-by-side in Excel, but I have to generate the rows for each table independently (i.e. from separate SQL queries). My first thought was to use tables-within-a-table in the HTML source, but it seems that Excel loses the column widths (i.e., the column widths change from what I've set them to before) when I try to create a new table inside one of the existing s\r\n\r\nI need to preserve the widths of the columns outside the inner table. Any idea how this can be done? Or maybe someone can point me to online resources that might help?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, this has been sort of a low-pri task for me, so I haven't had much time to check it out; but the deadline is creeping up on me fast. I've posted on some forums and asked around, but no positive responses so far. Any assistance is appreciated.",

I'm not here to talk about whether the loggers are indeed to blame, or how it's silly for the government to try to implement a total log ban when they can't even implement a selective log ban, or how chances are everyone important will forget about this in, say a month tops, while the victims continue their struggle to recover even a fraction of their once-normal lives. No, these topics have already been covered to death in serious newspaper editorials and columns. And possible internet discussions in Pinoy-bloggerland, I don't know, I'm not particularly familiar with that scene.\r\n\r\nNo, as always, I prefer to attack this from a more personal angle. And like some of my more interesting stories, this one is about a taxi driver.\r\n\r\nHe was a bit old, and his first few attempts at conversation were annoying at best. Later, toward the end of the trip, we glimpsed one of the day's headlines on some tabloid. Something about the government wanting to implement a total log ban. He goes on to say that's an impossible thing, they'd never be able to implement it.\r\n\r\nTurns out he worked for the Department of Environment and Natural Resources for some fifteen-odd years. As a forest ranger. Wow.\r\n\r\nNow of course, as someone who indulges often in the fantasy genre, my idea of &#8216;Forest Rangers' is closely associated either Aragorn from Lord of the Rings, or someone who likes to stop bears from stealing picnic baskets. This guy leaned more towards the latter.\r\n\r\nBased on his stories, it seems like the news articles detailing the lack of manpower at the DENR are accurate. He says forest rangers were often assigned to guard or patrol some forty hectares of land. Or maybe it was four hectares, I forget &#8212; I had this conversation more than three days ago. In any case, I have no idea how large a hectare is anyway. But from his narratives it seemed like the area assigned to them was far too much for one man to cover. Add to that the fact that he and his co-rangers were often harassed by Communist rebels that are supposedly in bed with the illegal loggers, and life was really difficult for them back then. It was a much easier life to just while away your day slacking or goofing off, rather than risk your own life to try to catch some illegal loggers who would probably get off the hook easily anyway.\r\n\r\nHe told about treestampers. Or something like that. Basically, people whose job it is to mark trees to indicate which ones are okay for cutting by which company. Or something. Forgive me; I'm really hazy on the details, maybe because I'm sleepy. Anyway, apparently a lot of these treestampers have lifestyles far beyond their income. When the bribe money comes in, it's a race to mark trees, with no regard for the tree's age or species or location or whatnot.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what I have to say about this, I just thought the hearsay I got from him would be interesting to relate. I'm not exactly a radical environmentalist. As a friend of mine once said, \"Trees? What have they ever done for me?\" I'm a city dude, born and bred, so I seldom worry about such things, it's not really part of my thinking. And I don't really think I can judge people who live on a small government subsidy and have to do what they can to get a decent living. Hey, we're all just out to make some scratch, right? Except that the living some of these guys make may have cost countless lives and destruction of property. Sadly, I think this is just part of the general malaise that plagues our society. Resources are scarce, so the less fortunate among us are forged to scrounge around for whatever we can, the law and the environment be damned. Of course, it doesn't help that the rest of the country only gives a damn shortly after a tragedy happens. Will we ever learn?",

There's a service for him at Pisay tomorrow, Dec. 3, Friday. Since I doubt I can go, I'll say my piece here.\r\n\r\nAlix was a helluva guy. Friendly and gets well with the students. And he gave high grades. Seriously. He gave me flat 1.0s (highest possible grade) for all four quarters of fourth year math. Now, not to brag, when I was in high school, math was my thing. Seriously, I could breeze through my high school math classes in my sleep. And few of my batch mates will contradict me when I say I was one of the best, if not _the _best in math in our batch. (That last part is debatable, some people might contest it. :p) The point of this is not me bragging, since I do that often, it's nothing special. No, the point is that I seldom took math period seriously. I often spent math class doodling something in my notebooks, at least on those occasions that I had a pen.\r\n\r\nOn one such math class, Alix caught me and a classmate (you know who you are... ) passing around a hand-drawn comic strip in class. (During my high school days, I often spent my free energy drawing such small strips about classroom happenings, particularly in the second year. Alas, none of the aforementioned high-school artworks have survived. But I digress.) I got a severe tongue-lashing for that one, something along the lines of \"No matter how good you are at math, you can't just goof off in class.\" I felt quite bad about the incident, not only because I got to eat some humble pie in front of the class, but mostly because I felt like I had disappointed the guy. It's not that I don't goof off in other classes, I certainly do; but I felt that Alix expected more of me, since for some reason he believed me to be a good student. I didn't have the nerve to respond or apologize to him about this, I just took my tongue-lashing in silence. I wish I had told him I was sorry. I realize this is such a small, trivial matter, but God knows I like to obsess over small, trivial matters.\r\n\r\nIn any case, cheers to you sir Alix, wherever you may be. I don't spend much time with the other alumni, but over the past few days, I've seen the news of your passing spread through the online Pisay alumni community quickly, and many are planning to be there Friday. Rest well, sir Alix, and know that your students look back at you fondly.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.livejournal.com/users/zukeeper/\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by btflpenguin on 2004-12-04 09:46:00 +0000\r\nSir Alix wasn't particularly one of my favorite math teachers, but then again\r\n  \r\ni wasn't as able in math as you were (think borderline bubing). My first\r\n  \r\ncomment when I heard about his passing was \"manginginom pala si sir\". It turns\r\n  \r\nout he took the chosen few out for drinks sometimes. And this was true for the\r\n  \r\nmany batches of Pisay people he taught. It must be something to leave such a\r\n  \r\nlegacy &#8212; not the drinking of course, but all that algebra/pre-calculus.\r\n\r\nang haba na nito pero may tanong pa ako &#8212; sino si entertainment capital?\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2004-12-06 22:10:00 +0000\r\nI guess he did drink often since it was cirrhosis, but at least it never\r\n  \r\nshowed during his classes, I believe. Lots of people drink &8212; I guess it\r\n  \r\ndoesn't really change my opinion of the man.\r\n\r\nComment by Anonymous on 2004-12-09 00:41:00 +0000\r\nHey, Peng, (or is it still Sushie?). It's me, \"Entertainment Capital\". Since\r\n  \r\nmy account's on LJ, Roy and I anonymously comment in each other's blogs.\r\n\r\nIn the year that Sir Alix was my boss, he was, as far as I could tell,\r\n  \r\ncompletely sober all of the time I was around. He convinced me that Pisay\r\n  \r\nshould destructure the calculus curriculum and to trickle it down the lower\r\n  \r\nyears, as he was teaching it partly in third year, though not as extreme as my\r\n  \r\nurging to find a way to lower the function analysis parts of it (pertinent for\r\n  \r\nlab reports) somehow to second (or first!) year. (He fully supported my move\r\n  \r\nto teach bridge in Math 7 for the second semester, by the by.)\r\n\r\nHis cirrhosis was probably due to earlier bouts of heavy drinking. From what I\r\n  \r\nhear, his drinking buddies were the heavy drinkers in campus. The year after I\r\n  \r\nleft, he started having fainting spells. Prior even to that, he has had bouts\r\n  \r\nof high blood pressure, though that could be as likely caused by teaching\r\n  \r\nstress as by liver problems, I have heard.\r\n\r\n Comment by btflpenguin on 2004-12-09 23:05:00 +0000\r\nit's when people pass on that you realize how sayang the opportunity was to\r\n  \r\nreally get to know them. when Sir Alix was my teacher, (or any math teacher,\r\n  \r\nkasi nga i didn't and still don't like math) all i remember was looking at my\r\n  \r\nwatch waiting for free cut to occur. Pero si sir nagbibigay ng leakage, sorta\r\n  \r\nlike near the exams biglang buhos ng math (that i still did not get, btw)\r\n  \r\ntapos lalabas pala yon sa exam. That's the extent of my memory. Kakainggit\r\n  \r\nlang siguro yung mga students who were actually friends with him.\r\n\r\nit's peng now, and not sushie. at mike, pwede ba kita i-link?",

This is my looking back/looking forward post, for the transition between 2004 and 2005, no more than eleven days late. (I'm part-Chinese, so I actually get to delay this until Chinese New Year, but I'm cool, so I'll do it early.)\r\n\r\n**\r\n  \r\n2004 Highlights\r\n  \r\n** \r\n\r\nIn mostly chronological, but actually no particular, order:\r\n\r\n  I dared to fall in love, consequently got my heart broken. Am still in the same place, apparently.\r\n  I was able to go outside the country for the first time.\r\n  Bought a digital camera (and still no phone!)\r\n  Went to Bicol for the first time in eight years.\r\n  I passed the JITSE certification exam.\r\n  I got to read more.\r\n  I started to have health concerns.\r\n  Oh, and I'm not sure, but I may very well have pissed off my dentist.\r\n  I started taking this blog a bit more seriously. Added the comments thing, made it a bit more public. My favorite post of this year: My Eyeglasses Belong to the Sea.\r\n\r\nSeriously, I think I've changed a lot this past year. Especially due to the first entry above. Personally, I feel like I've broadened my horizons somewhat, I feel stronger, better as a person, more confident in myself. I'm a lot less antisocial now, and heaven forbid, I actually greet people in the office in the mornings and before I go home! Professionally, I feel like I've accomplished a lot as well. I learned a lot of new things; I'm a Web developer now, although my area of expertise is now apparently Oracle Reports; Participated in a lot more projects than I did in 2003, learned a lot of new stuff; Became a trainer for several batches of newbies (I think half the office calls me &#8216;Sir' now... ); had my first ON, etc. All in all, a very productive/fruitful/exciting year was 2004.\r\n\r\nAnd the future? What does 2005 hold for our brave not-so-young hero?\r\n\r\nI tried thinking up some New Year's resolutions, but, as many intelligent folk know, resolutions suck. Sure, they probably have some motivational value, but if you really know what you want, you shouldn't need the end of an arbitrarily-decided calendar year to start. So, in lieu of resolutions, I present the following list of things-I-might-have-resolved-to-do:\r\n\r\n  Blog every day. This was a good idea, but I figured forcing yourself to do something regularly _just for the sake of it _was not a good thing. I'll blog when I have something to say, thanks.\r\n  Learn to cook/bowl well. This sounds neat. But the real problem with me trying to learn new skills outside my comfort zone is that they tend to eat up goof-off time. But I _want _to learn new things. So, for this one, I'll do 'em if I can and I feel like it.\r\n  Learn PHP/mySQL and use dynamic stuff for this website. This is an easier proposition, since it's something that falls well within one of my areas of interest (coding). However, I already code a lot at work, so I'm not really that motivated to code outside of work. I think I may be able to do this to some degree or other though.\r\n  Broaden my horizons. Do new things. Visit new places. This is a good idea. And I hope I can do it some. But I won't resolve to do it.\r\n\r\nThat's it I guess, let's see what 2005 has in store for us. Bring it!\r\n\r",

I finished the main story just before the year's end [2]. But I've still been actively playing it, going through the bonus dungeons [3] \r\n\r\nThe fact that I finished it, and the fact that I am still playing it, and the fact that I am still planning to finish it on both of the higher difficulty levels, all of these facts speak volumes about how good this game is, given that I don't have nearly as much time to play as I did before I was working. \r\n\r\nThe story/plot is so-so, not too strong, but some of the characters [4] are cool. Space-faring lad gets stranded on backwards-planet, gets involved and suddenly gets thrust into a conflict against the Creator that threatens the existance of the very universe. The usual sort of thing. There's a giant plot twist somewhere in the second disc that changes the very nature of the Star Ocean universe and guarantees that this is, in fact, the last game of the series. Actually, in retrospect, the plot is fairly okay, but it could've been pulled off better. \r\n\r\nThe gameplay is where it's at of course. As well know, RPGs are about gameplay, not story. [5] Gameplay-wise, the single best feature of this game is: Battle Trophies! Battle Trophies are awards granted to you for certain things done in combat, such as avoiding certain spells, winning with no damage, winning by tiny slivers of life, etc. Many boss battles have associated battle trophies such as \"Defeat so-and-so in 1 minute\" or \"Defeat so-and-so without taking damage.\" Accumulating battle trophies means unlocking higher difficulty levels, extra costumes and extra modes. \r\n\r\nThe other good things carry over from Star Ocean 2. The real-time battle system is the same, with a bunch of improvements. The Fury gauge stops battles from being a button-bashing-fest, and the anti-attack auras add some tactical element to the battles. Damage bonuses for chaining together special moves are neat. \r\n\r\nItem Creation is still here, but the system is vastly different from SO2. Instead of just crafting items yourself anywhere you are, you can hire inventors to work for you in workshops throughout the world. You can work with them of course, in an assembly line fashion that shows your characters going through various experiments to make stuff. However, I greatly miss that feature of Star Ocean 2's Item Creation where you are shown a blob of some sort of raw creation material that slowly but surely transforms into a wonderful item. Losing that feature sort of removed the joy of item creation. =p \r\n\r\nThere are however, some bad things about this game. Mostly minor nitpicks actually. The most important one is this: \r\n\r\nThe menu interface for the battle arena sucks. \r\n\r\nSeriously, everytime I go to fight the ranking battles, I have to go through three or four menus. One to ask whether I need to be given a tutorial. One to choose what type of battle I want to fight. Before I beat the champions, I get asked whether I want to fight them. One where I choose the opponent for my battle. The one with the tutorial really ticks me off every time I see it. I've already read the tutorial! Must you ask me every single time? Would you like fries with that? \r\n\r\nReally, the \"I'd like an explanation\" thing could just be placed in the second menu. I should only have to decide two things: One, I want to fight a ranking battle; and two, I want to choose my opponent. Single battles or team battles are slightly worse, as you must choose your fighter and your difficulty level in addition to the above choices. I wonder how hard it would have been to make a simple menu system for the arena, instead of relying on the conversation system? \r\n\r\nI realize this is a really petty thing to note, but when you start playing the battle arena, you have to go through those menus repeatedly every two or three minutes. It got annoying fast. And don't get me started on those bunny races...  \r\n\r\nThe other bad thing is: bad endings. Well, I wasn't expecting much given that the story wasn't that good anyway, but eh? The general ending wasn't much more than \"Hey, we're still alive! Cool!\", and the individual endings were a bit sleepy. Or maybe it was just the lackluster music playing during the endings? \r\n\r\nOverall though, a decidedly good game, one I'm going to try to finish at least two more times, and a worthy end to the Star Ocean series. Looking forward to Tri-Ace's next series...  /p \r\n\r\ndiv\r\n  [1] and a side-story for a portablebr / [2] that means I actually finished two RPGs last year. That's right. I think FF X-2 was an RPG and was released last year.br / [3] just finished the Maze of Tribulations today. Quick tip: the boss there is cake if you have paralysis immunity. Mmm... cake.br / [4] read: Nelbr / [5] which is why I never finished Xenosaga. I hope we get more RPGs that don't try to be a cinemafest like Metal Gear Solid 3. Gee, two quick reviews of games I didn't finish in a foot note! I'm proud.\r\n/div",

That's when I started the site on topcities some time back. I moved some of the \"journal\" posts I had from there into blogger, using a very detailed process I shall refer to as \"manual copy-and-paste and editing of links\". I still had some backup copies of most of the old site around, and archive.org was a big help. There wasn't much editing actually, I just went through most of the links and marked those which were broken. I didn't transfer (yet) any posts which needed additional files to exist on my own server, those are a bit more troublesome, so later. All in all, the content of the posts are presented as they are, or were, typos and all, making these archives a genuine representation of my frame of mind circa 2002.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this exercise is of course for posterity. Putting all these posts in one place makes it easy for me to export them in some method in the future. (And even if blogger goes down for some reason, these posts are now also hosted on my fateback account, and you know there's safety in redundancy.) So, past memories safely preserved.\r\n\r\nAfter all, that's what a journal should be about right? Something that lets you look back into the past, to see what B*S you were trying to put out back then. Online journals are roughly ten thousand times more exciting than private ones; if you're honest enough (i.e., you don't edit out any embarassing stuff from old posts), there's always the tendency for something from the past to come back and bite you in the ass.\r\n\r\nAs an example, in the last post I made a comment about how I may have pissed my dentist off. It's a funny story actually. I wanted to post, but was in too much tooth-pain to think clearly; so after the tooth-pain cleared, I decided to post about it. (Note to future self: even if you move to a different server, keep the fateback account, so these permalinks would still actually work.) About a week after that, I sent an email to my dentist, (wow, I exchange email with my dentist, I'm like, so cutting edge, for 1999) and she read the blog entry. She mailed me back saying the post \"knocked her off her chair\", or something. I emailed back, saying it was just an exaggeration, hoping I didn't piss her off. She hasn't responded yet though (and I haven't needed any dentist-time lately), so I conclude that there's a distinct possibility I may actually have pissed her off. I'll found out when I need to get this impacted molar removed, I suppose.\r\n\r\nSo, anyway, yeah. Coming back to bite you in the ass. And for this reason, I'm hesitant to let anyone at work know about this blog. (At least one person at work knows it exists, but does not know the location) My long-term memory is a bit stupid, I may have inadvertently said something here that may be bad for me professionally, I'm not really sure. And of course I have no idea how a certain someone would react to me publishing on the internet my feelings about her.\r\n\r\nWhat am I saying? Am I going to be more circumspect in the future, and avoid anything that may get me in trouble? Hell, no. Although I did breifly consider taking down the Unrequited post, I'm pretty sure I should stand for what I've written. No matter how bad, sappy, or stupid it was, it's my work, I should just take it for what it is. Hence bringing back the old posts.\r\n\r\nHmm... I really only wanted to post that I was bringing back the old posts. I talk a lot.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://topcities.com\r\n [2]: http://www.archive.org\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/blog/?p=93\r",

This and some other mashups here.

Great stuff.\r\n\r\nOther songs/bands I've been listening to lately:\r\n\r\nLocally, Spongecola is hot. Their album has several good tracks (since I don't listen to radio, I'm not sure which of them are popular or not.) My favorites are \"Jeepney\", \"Lunes\", \"22\", \"Partisan\", \"Dragonfly\", \"Jillian\" and \"KLSP\"... um, I'm pretty close to naming the whole album :p. They also have this great live rendition of Madonna's \"Crazy For You\" going around.\r\n\r\nSugarfree's last album is also heavy on my playlist -- I think their \"Hari ng Sablay\" has been getting some serious airplay. My favorite Sugarfree track is from their first album though -- it's \"Burnout\".\r\n\r\nOf course there's Rivermaya's new single \"You'll Be Safe Here\". Pretty good, Rico Blanco is really good with the lyrics.\r\n\r\nFor live performances, I posted a link to the AlphaQuam Live Music Archive on delicious a while back. They have this great performance of \"Careless Whisper\" by Ben Folds and Rufus Wainwright. If you want more rock-type sounds, try Vertical Horizon's live rendition of \"You're A God\", complete with Top Gun intro.\r\n\r\nOh, and one song that's been on LSS for me all day: \"King of Pain\" by Sting.

Anyone who grew up in the 80s will appreciate Bob Ong's trip back to his elementary/high school/college days. His tales of school will ring true to anyone from around the same era; younger folk may not appreciate it so much. (My younger brother seems to have no idea what _Spin-a-win _is/was, although he is aware of SOS, Flames, etc.)\r\n\r\nThe earlier parts of the book are mostly funny and/or amusing, detailing those silly little things that school kids tend to obsess with. The latter parts start to get serious once the author gets to his college years; he goes into serious stories of dropping out of college, taking a vocational course and eventually becoming a teacher, where the book comes full circle (and a bit preachy as well).\r\n\r\nThe book is hard to classify; it's not exactly comedy, it's not exactly serious. It's more like the author kept a running blog since he was in grade school and published it all. Also, there doesn't seem to be much information about the author himself; apparently \"Bob Ong\" is a pseudonym of some sort. A very satisfying read all in all, I know this because I felt compelled to buy his next two books because of it. His books are cheaper than the usual book prices anyway =)\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.visprint.net/publications/bob/faq.htm\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by aira ong on 2008-02-01 22:05:55 +0000\r\nwow grabe !!

Or it may have been on ZSNES, I'm not entirely sure anymore. Before that was the first Zelda, which I actually finished on its original console! \r\n\r\nSeems that the years have been kind to the Zelda formula: Octoroks and Tektites on the world map, Bats, Skeletons and Wizrobes underground, Boomerangs and Arrows to throw about, Pieces of Heart to collect, Swords, Bottles, hidden passages, name it, it's all here. I miss Dodongo though. :p \r\n\r\nOne thing to note about the Zelda series... they're really good with level design, and the use of space. The overworld of Minish Cap is a good example. The land of Hyrule is relatively smaller this time around compared to Link To The Past, but the game mechanics of having the ability to occasionally shrink to insect-size and the ability to unlock new areas with kinstone fusions mean you'll be visiting most areas several times, making the most of the space. Of course, there's the usual Zelda mechanics of passageways hidden by bombs, secrets accessible only with the use of tools, etc. Maybe it's just that I haven't played a Zelda game for so long, but I'm just amazed at how much stuff they can pack into it. \r\n\r\nThe puzzles were ok, the usual block puzzles and stuff. Nothing too difficult, but not too easy either. I wish they had put some super-difficult puzzles for optional sidequests though. (The sidequests here mostly rely on collecting kinstones.) I think something along the lines of Lufia II's \"World's Most Difficult Trick\" would have been nice. I was particularly disappointed by the \"walking\" puzzles in the final dungeon, where you have to walk over a certain set of tiles continuously without repeating any tiles. The two such puzzles I encountered were straightforward. Why introduce that type of puzzle if it was going to be so easy? \r\n\r\nBoss battles were ok, with some difficult ones being the Octorok in the Temple of Droplets, and any battle that needed me to split into four. I guess the clone battles would have been easier if I had gotten the \"fast spirit bar charging\" upgrade thingy. The final boss was moderately difficult, but then again I only had two bottles. With four bottles I might have started yawning. :p \r\n\r\nWhen I was in college and had more free time, I would have surely completed everything there was in the game, but these days, I just finish it and be done with it. (Same with Star Ocean 3, I only managed to beat one optional dungeon and boss.) \r\n\r\nOverall Minish Cap is a good game, as I'm pretty sure every Zelda is. The designers are still pretty good, not many boring parts in the game (the figurine thing was boring though... mainly because the interface was so tedious.)

I'm already thinking of buying one, as it would give me access to all those great Nintendo franchises [1] in their pure 2D forms, without me having to buy a different console.\r\n\r\nBecause honestly, consoles suck, I wouldn't want to maintain one. Not that I don't like my PS2, the games are great and all. But think about how PC gaming will always be superior to console gaming because of compatibiliy. I mean, if I had a game from 10 years ago, I would probably still be able to play it on the PC [2], and that includes games from old consoles. This is why I like the idea of the GBA, even though I've never actually owned a gameboy. I see all these nice GBA titles around and I figure even if Nintendo releases a new GB-style handheld, it'll be backward compatible and I can play those suckers! And GBA titles don't seem to be affected by the price multiplication that happens to PS2 titles. [3]\r\n\r\nLet me repeat: consoles suck. Not console games mind you, console games are great and I love playing them, I just wish I didn't have to play them on consoles. Thank god for emulation.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer: Okay, I've overreacting, consoles don't really suck, but I really hate my PS2 right now.\r\n\r\ndiv\r\n  [1] Zelda, Metroid, Castlevania... well ok, that last one was a Konamibr / [2] heaven knows my brother is still trying to finish Wizardry VIIbr / [3] gee, is it because of piracy? Probably not, piracy ups prices from the game publishers themselves. What's happening here is that local PS2 titles are priced far beyond the actual release prices of the games. Maybe it's stupidity.\r\n/div\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.gearlive.com/index.php/news/article/featurewhysonyspspwillsuck02070458/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/blog/2005/02/some-thoughts-on-piracy/\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by erick on 2006-11-25 14:43:27 +0000\r\nmy psp is the best the DS sucks ass",

The rail authorities can probably refuse entry to anyone for any reason they consider valid.\r\n\r\nIt's probably legal, but I doubt it's enforceable though. Anyone who's ridden the MRT during rush hours knows what I'm talking about. Security inspections last roughly half a second for every three passengers; the security personnel will simply make a quick pass through your bags with their stick. Any containers inside the one inspected are let through easily. In fact, even though I ride the MRT nearly everyday [1], I've never encountered anyone being turned away because of what they were carrying.\r\n\r\nI've lost count of the number of times I've premeditated how easy it would be to sneak some sort of undesirable element into an MRT station. I ride the MRT every day knowing full well that any half-hearted troublemaker could easily put my life in peril. Riding the MRT is probably only marginally safer than duking it out with the buses on EDSA.\r\n\r\nMall security is even worse, those inspections done by security guards at mall entrances are a waste of time. At least the MRT guys have the excuse that they have to deal with droves of people at a time; There are mall entrances where they barely glance at your stuff in a routine manner; you could be sneaking in a decapitated human head in a plastic bag and they wouldn't notice. The only criminals that would be stopped by these half-hearted measures are the stupid ones. The smart (hence dangerous) ones would easily breeze through.\r\n\r\nNot that I _want _the hassle of through security checks mind you. It's just that the current practices seem pretty much a waste of time, when these inspections are just to show the public that MRTs/Malls are \"safe.\"\r\n\r\nEdit 14/Feb: BoingBoing has picked up on this. \r\n\r\ndiv\r\n  [1] except when I'm lazy and decide to take a cab\r\n/div\r\n\r\n [1]: http://clair.free.net.ph/10\r\n [2]: http://www.boingboing.net/2005/02/13/manilatransitcops_.html\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by eClair on 2005-02-14 16:49:00 +0000\r\nYou know Beautiful Rookery?\r\n\r\nShe is a friend of one of my friends:)\r\n\r\nAnyhow, it's really easy to sneak optical media into the train stations.

I knew we had pirated copies of both.\r\n\r\nSpiderman 2 -- failed. The PS2 wouldn't even play the disc. Instead it made a wonderful churning noise that made me quickly hit the eject button. This is Sony's best form of copy protection: In my experience, our PS2 can only play somewhere between 30% -- 50% of all pirated discs out there. I don't know... it may just be our PS2 model. Sometimes if I particularly like a game, I will buy 2-3 pirated copies until I find one that agrees with our PS2. This is why I have 3 copies of Star Ocean: Til The End Of Time.\r\n\r\nNaruto 2 -- failed. I couldn't find the disc. I tried searching through all the PS2 DVD cases we have, but I was unsuccessful. In the average pinoy techie's house, there would be hundreds of audio CDs, VCDs, data CDs and DVDs, many of them pirated. Finding one specific disc outside of its case is a nigh-impossible task. Going out and buying a new (pirated) copy would be far easier [1]\r\n\r\nIf piracy is so problematic, why use pirated discs? Because frankly, the alternatives are roughly 10 times more expensive. At least. This is especially true for PS2 games; last I checked PS2 games retail for around 4000 pesos around here (more than 80 dollars) By comparison, PC games retail for roughly the correct dollar-equivalent prices. [2]\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that I have NEVER bought original PS2 games [3], while I have bought several original PC games. Not only that, but if things continue as-is, I will NEVER buy original PS2 or PS1 games, even though there are some games I would like to own originals of [4]. The astute Pinoy gamer would note that the price of even PS1 titles is still roughly around 3000-4000 pesos, which makes no sense at all.\r\n\r\nI wonder what compels store owners to sell PS2 originals at these prices? Are there so many piracy-conscious console owners that they are able to fuel such a high demand for PS2 originals that result in high prices? Who buys at these stores?\r\n\r\nI don't know why games (and digital media in general) have to be the same cost or more expensive in a third world country where people obviously have less money than developed nations. Of course, I am not saying we are entitled to lower prices because we are poor. But don't companies who sell these consider that selling to citizens of developing nations at lower prices would be better than the zero sales caused by high prices/piracy combination?\r\n\r\nIn the future, I may be more compelled to buy console originals online, especially if I can find good deals on used copies. Well, at least as soon as I become more confident about buying things online.\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\ndiv\r\n  [1] and probably cheaper if you consider time a costbr / [2] I got both Warcraft III and the Frozen Throne expansion for around 1500 pesos each.br / [3] although Star Ocean made me come close to buying one online or something, even a used copybr / [4] Final Fantasy Tactics and Street Fighter Alpha 3 come to mind.\r\n/div\r\n\r",

The sprawling worlds travelled by Roland of Gilead and his band of gunslingers continues to draw me in; I guess the romantic western atmosphere really appeals to me.\r\n\r\nDuring these two books, we follow Roland Deschain, the last gunslinger, Eddie and Susannah, gunslingers-in-training as they forge ahead on the road to the Dark Tower, where the fate of all worlds may be decided. Along the way, they gain new allies, one thought previously dead. They storm across the fallen city of Lud, blaze across the wastelands on an insane sentient train, and finally land in Kansas. It is in Kansas that Roland narrates a tale of his youth, and of his days and Gilead.\r\n\r\nIt is Roland's tales of Gilead that I most enjoy in the series. Roland's world, the world that has moved on, is a medieval-western hybrid of sorts. A world where people look to gunslingers with fear and respect, a world where a misspoken word in a tavern can get you killed, a world fraught with danger and adventure. In this tale we learn of what happened to Roland after he passed his rite of passage, his first love, and his decision to pursue the Dark Tower.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the last three books... all of which are out in hard cover versions. Wizard and Glass ends on much less of a cliffhanger than Wastelands, so I'm willing to wait a bit for the paperback copies to come out, though I hope it doesn't take too long.",

A short while after, I also picked up his next two books, _Bakit Baliktad Magbasa ng Libro Ang Mga Pilipino? _(Why Do Filipinos Read Backwards?) and _Ang Paboritong Libro ni Hudas _(Judas' Favorite Book).\r\n\r\n\"Bakit Baligtad\" focuses on the Philippines, its people, its quirks and its problems. \"Paboritong Libro\" is a lot harder to classify, as it jumps across several topics, with the unifying theme being the chapters named after anagrams of the seven deadly sins. At least I think that's the unifying theme... \r\n\r\n\"Paboritong Libro\" is also the better of the two books. Or at least the easier read, as \"Bakit Baligtad\" had a tendency to be a lot more serious and preachy, which might turn off people looking for a light read. Also, \"Bakit Baligtad\" contains a significant amount of non-original material, from the apparently-now-defunct Bobong Pinoy website and from several online forums.\r\n\r\nIn fact, after reading \"Bakit Baligtad\", I realized the particular appeal of Bob Ong's books... all of them, including the first one, read like they were written on the internet. Maybe in a blog or something. Each book is like some sort of running commentary on some part of life in general; (the first book was about education, the second about the Philippines; I'm still not sure what the third book was about) That's why it's so hard to pin down, it leaves you with that internet feeling of \"hey-when's-the-next-update?\"\r\n\r\nBoth books are generally hit-or-miss though, with a bit more hit than miss, same as the first one. Some good parts, some you'd want to sleep through. They're good for the price they're at. In any case, I'll probably pick up his next book as an impulse buy if I see it.\r\n\r\nMy favorite part of these two books (I'm not sure which book it was in anymore) was a list of amusing signs found all over the Philippines. One of them is described as such: on a cracked lopsided wall along Libis, QC: Danger Wall is Falling! \r\n\r\nHehe, that cracks me up, and I'm not sure why. I'd like to see that wall.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/blog/2005/02/books-abnkkbsknplako-by-bob-ong/\r\n [2]: http://www.google.com/search?q=bobong+pinoy&sourceid=mozilla-search&start=0&start=0&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official\r\n [3]: http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&lr=&c2coff=1&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&q=%22danger+wall+is+falling%22&btnG=Search\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by clair on 2005-03-08 22:16:00 +0000\r\nI should grab a copy of some of his books.

And normally, I don't care, I just ignore them. On battle.net, I just let them be, and keep on playing. Every so often however, some guy comes along who just pisses me off completely.\r\n\r\nSo I play random 3v3, right? It's not the most \"skillful\" type of battles, but it's fun and I enjoy it. My record's nothing too good to look at, but I wouldn't call myself a newb. I play a game, I get a team with a lvl 27, two lvl 16s (I'm one of them)\r\n\r\nSoon as the game starts, the 27 guy (Green) asks us \"You guys any good?\" Now, some people may or may not realize this, but this is rude. There's no point in asking, I don't think there's any satisfactory answer that can be given. And many people don't like to brag, so more often than not your answers will be along the line of \"I guess so\", \"I'm not so bad\", or if your allies are insecure, \"I'm sucky.\" But you almost never get the answer you want. You can check their stats if you want, but why bother asking them if they're good?\r\n\r\nAnyway, I normally just ignore these questions, and I did. And smartly enough, my other ally, the other 16 guy (Blue) ignored him as well. I'm not sure why I was stupid enough to do it, but when he asked again, I responded: \"I won 12 out of the last 15, does that make me good?\" It was true; I was on some sort of streak I guess.\r\n\r\nHis answer was: \"No it doesn't. I hope you guys don't play like level 16, or we're gonna lose.\" Yeah, like level means anything in random team battles any more.\r\n\r\nSo we go to harass, and he's all \"I don't wanna leave my base, I'm gonna get rushed.\" And since he wants it, sure enough he gets rushed. We go back, we fend it off, and he's really thankful: \"I'm really sick of being rushed, that's why I don't harass. Let's just creep.\"\r\n\r\nSo we split up and take the greens. (The map was that 6-player one with all the water. Typhoon? I'm not sure.) A while later, we get a message. His Level 1 Dark Ranger got killed by creeps. He's embarrassed. \"OMG! That's so nobish [sic] of me! I'm so embarrassed!\"\r\n\r\nWe creep some more, we run into 2 of the enemy armies, take out a few fiends and grunts before they run back. He sees my army. \"OMG mass hunts!\" he says, even though I told him early on I was getting hunts and dryads. He must've been too busy whining to himself about his noob teammates.\r\n\r\nWe decide to hit the orc base. We go in, And the battle is fairly furious, a lot of units die. I get messages saying my allies' heroes go down, so I give the \"b\" word. We start falling back. Green gets started again.\r\n\r\n\"OMG pink [me], there's no way you won 12 of 15, you're such a noob! You're a liar!\"\r\n\r\nOkay, that's it. I could handle arrogant allies, but this one had the balls to call me a liar. I rip into him.\r\n\r\n\"Listen here. I'm not the one who lost his hero while creeping. I didn't lose any heroes back there. In fact, I killed 3 heroes before we pulled out. What have you been up to?\"\r\n\r\nThat shut him up. Blue, by the way, has been cool all this time, just letting Green be. Anyway, Green starts lagging. I start pumping out archers and dryads to counter the wyverns. Green's base gets attacked. I TP in. We push them back. We head back to the orc base for a counteroffensive.\r\n\r\nHe's lagging some more. I fire another shot: \"You know what the best part is? Your clever moonwell placement has trapped my keeper in the trees.\"\r\n\r\nWe hit the orc base, taking out grunts and shamans and wyverns and fiends left and right. Green lags out. Good riddance. We pull out for a bit to regroup. I take control of Green's army, Blue handles his base. We hit the orc base again. Towers and burrows start going down. We sweep, we clean up, we wipe the floor (all without my Keeper, still cluelessly stuck between moonwells. The Priestess misses him so.) Just before the game ends, I tell Blue my not-so-secret opinion: \"Green was an idiot.\"\r\n\r\nSadly, I forgot to save the replay. I don't even remember who Blue was. I do remember who green was however, and I have a message for him.\r\n\r\nThis is for you, III_III of Lordaeron.

He's the last of us, three brothers who all went through Pisay. I've never seen the pool up close before today. It doesn't look very deep.\r\n\r\nI'm incoherent. It might be because I've been reading the Sluggy Freelance archives since I got home.\r\n\r\nThe graduation ceremony was mostly boring. I think most are, unless you're one of the graduates. Or one of the graduates' parents. Or one of those CAT guys who stops people with digital cameras from getting too close. Too bad I forgot to charge the digital camera batteries before going, or else we would have actually had more than five pictures.\r\n\r\nThe commencement speaker was some guy from batch '69 [1] with lots of degrees, awards and accolades. I swear, if I ever become commencement speaker, I'm gonna be really easy to introduce, since I won't have so much crap attached to my name. But you never know what might happen in 16 years [2].\r\n\r\nThe commencement speech was dull, the usual thing commencement speakers say, talking about the graduate's future, the uncertainty, the excitement blah blah blah. If I was the one giving a commencement speech (I have a feeling this blog post will be a basis for my never ever getting that chance), I'd probably talk less about hard work and more about passion. Hard work is nice, but it's passion, drive, energy that gets you places.\r\n\r\nThey have this new thing this year, where they don't have a valedictorian, salutatiorian, etc. Instead, they have people with \"High Honors\" (weighted average 1.50-1.20) and people with \"Highest Honors\" (weighted average 1.20-1.00) It's like the college system of cum laudes. Except it sucks. \"Valedictorian\" looks so much better on a resume than \"Highest Honors\", but if you're relying on high school accolades on your resume to land you a job, you probably won't get it anyway, so I guess it works out. Sort of.\r\n\r\nOnly teacher who recognized me there was good old Vlad. The guy's been teaching Econ for ten years! Well, okay maybe not. I heard he took time off to either take an MBA or go surfing in Hawaii, maybe both. But judging from the comments in the graduation speech, he still enjoys torturing the kids. Ma'am Serrano might have recognized me, but then again, she recognizes everybody.\r\n\r\nThe PSHS Gymnasium is an unforgiving boiling kettle of intolerable heat, especially during these hot summer days. I wonder if I will ever step foot in it again.\r\n\r\nEdit: I'm a moron. I really was incoherent. I forgot I was going to talk about the ten years after part until I saw the title published on the page itself.\r\n\r\nAnyway, yeah. Ten years. It's been ten years since I left Pisay to face the cruel world. And where am I now? No earth-shaking accomplishments yet? It's like when we were graduating, things were exciting, we were going out to conquer a brave new world! Maybe peng was right, ten years might just be too short to \"Stand tall and shake the heavens\" [3] At least, I haven't heard of anyone else in the batch stunning the world with their brilliance yet, so I guess I'm not behind, yet.\r\n\r\ndiv\r\n  [1] first Pisay batch ever.

The first thing I did was add some Javascript that allows you to show/hide individual posts on the page. But actually, I don't really like it, I'll remove it later.\r\n\r\nI'm also wondering whether it's possible to have a Javascript hack that allows Blogger to have categories? The Category names would have to be included in maybe the post title text or the post body text, then we'd have a Javascript parser that determines the correct categories for each post. Then we could append category names to the URL to allow viewing by category, using javascript again to parse the URL to find which categories need to be displayed.\r\n\r\nSeems like a lot of work though. My Javascript is not as strong as I want it to be &#8212; although I have a pretty good idea of how it works, I'm no expert. So I guess working on these hacks would be good practice, but maybe the time would be better spent learning PHP and preparing to move to a paid webhost? (If wasting time is a consideration, it's too late -- I've already spent some two hours fooling around with the current template.)\r\n\r\nA bit sleepy. After all, it is almost 4 AM. I'll try to fix this thing later.\r\n\r\nOn hindsight, I should've set up a test blog and toyed around with that instead of modifying this one directly.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by btflpenguin on 2005-03-26 20:32:00 +0000\r\nito ba yung may link na \"more\" sa bottom ng post and you click on it to see\r\n  \r\nthe entire post? when you figure it out, pakopya code ha 🙂\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2005-03-26 20:39:00 +0000\r\nNo, I'm actually referring to something different.

(Paraphrased somewhat, mostly because we don't really speak in English all the time.)\r\n\r\nAlvin: Shall we take the shortcut through the seminary? Do you think the gate is open?\r\n\r\nRoy: I don't think so, let's just take the direct route.\r\n\r\nAlvin: Oh come on, I think it's still open, we can take the risk.\r\n\r\nRoy: I don't think the risk is worth it. If the gate is open, we save around two minutes of walking, otherwise we have to spend some extra five to ten minutes walking back.\r\n\r\nAlvin: But it's probably open!\r\n\r\nRoy: We don't know that. We don't have enough information on the gate's state to determine whether it's open or not. Right now, according to quantum mechanics, that gate is both open and closed, and we can't determine whether we should take it or not until we actually walk up to the gate! It's Schrodinger's gate!\r\n\r\nAlvin: Tell you what, when we get to the seminary, we'll split up, you take the direct route, I'll go for the gate.\r\n\r\nRoy: Huh? I don't see what your experiment would prove. It makes no sense to compare the travel time of a person taking the direct route and a person going through either the closed or open gate. We know the outcome depends only on the current state of the gate. A more sensible experiment would be to have two people try to go through the gate, but one of them will find it closed, one of them will find it open, and... \r\n\r\nAlvin: Let's just do it.\r\n\r\nRoy: Okay.\r\n\r\nWe split up.\r\n\r\nWhen I get home, I ring the doorbell. Alvin answers the door.\r\n\r\nAlvin: Ahead by a bit under two minutes. Told ya!\r\n\r\nRoy: Okay, you were right, it was open. But I don't see what this little experiment proves, after all, if we were in the same situation again later, this experiment doesn't help us make a decision.\r\n\r\nAlvin: Basta. I was right.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by btflpenguin on 2005-03-24 09:18:00 +0000\r\nawww. this entry screams geek. and it runs in the family pa 🙂\r\n\r\n(geek is meant as a compliment, sometimes geek means cool)\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2005-03-25 12:55:00 +0000\r\nYou should hear the conversations we have at home -- we often have discussions\r\n  \r\non economics theory, especially since Vlad was Alvin's econ teacher this year.\r\n  \r\n😀",

I signed up, and roy.blogsome.com was still available (nothing there, don't bother looking)\r\n\r\nAm I going to leave blogger? I don't know, really, I'm already pretty comfortable with it already, and moving to WordPress means learning a while new templating language (I know it would take all of an hour to get it down, but still... inertia).\r\n\r\nI'm definitely not moving to Blogsome right now though, as there is currently no way to use WordPress' import from Blogger feature with Blogsome since they do not provide FTP uploads for you. My other issue is that since everything would be hosted on Blogsome servers, there's a lot less control than with Blogger.\r\n\r\nAs far as I'm concerned, WordPress has only one thing which Blogger still does not have: categories. If you're anything like me and you like to pretend to be organized, categories are a big step towards that. I have no doubt that Blogger will eventually have categories sometime in the feature, but right now they're having trouble keeping their existing features from the hiccups.\r\n\r\nAh, if only I got could get some free/cheap webhosting with a significant amount of space and JSP/Tomcat support.

I finished it around Holy Week, but haven't bothered to go through again, even though I promised myself I would try since I did not get the magic number of a hundred and eight stars of destiny this time around. Curse my pride for not reading any FAQs while playing! Time is short, with work and all, so I should make the most of my games so I don't need to re-play them. \r\n\r\nSuiko 4 has big steps to fill. The first two Suikoden games gained quite a following on the PSX, and the third game, while taking things in a somewhat different direction, was pretty good as well. Does Suiko 4 live up to the series' legacy? \r\n\r\nWell... no. It's mostly the same as Suiko 1 and 2, but the plot is a lot simpler this time, and quite uninspired. Very few truly moving mments or scenes. The story takes place in the Island Nations some hundreds of years before the events of Suiko 1. Only three characters are here from previous games: Viki (no surprise there), Jeane (WTF? How is she alive at this time? Does she possess a true rune?) And Ted, the original bearer of the Soul-Eater true rune from Suikoden 1. The worst part is I didn't get Ted! Damn it. I shouldn't have rushed the last part of the game. \r\n\r\nHaving the Soul-Eater would have been good, because frankly, the hero's true rune in this game, the Rune of Punishment, is really lame. Story-wise and gameplay wise. The story of Suikoden games have always revolved around the 27 True Runes... powerful, living artifacts of magic that shape the destiny of the world. Sought after not only because of the immense power they wield, but also because the True Runes grant their bearers one thing men can only dream of: immortality. This game is about one madman's desire to possess the power of the True Rune of Punishment. \r\n\r\nIn fact, the story follows quite the same trend as Suiko 1 and 2. Hero is a young member of prestigious nation's military arm. Hero is forced to leave his home for some reason. Hero finds a True Rune. Hero gathers together a huge army to lay the smackdown on an evil Empire. When the war is done, Hero fades into obscurity. Really, no spoilers here. So why the plot fall so flat if it's following a tried-and-true formula? \r\n\r\nI think it's because of the uninspired supporting cast. The silent unnamed hero of Suiko 4 doesn't have any strong, loyal personalities attached to him (Gremio in Suiko1, Nanami in Suiko2, a buttload of people in Suiko3) Because of this, he lacks a powerful mouthpiece to help drive the plot forward. Also, it has always been the problem in the Suikoden series that since they always have a cast of 108 in each game, many characters are underdeveloped. But in Suiko 4, I find it hard to name more than five \"solid\" characters that drive the plot. And the Silverburg tactician here is boring here as well. No particularly clever plots or tactics here, don't expect any Matthiu or Shu tricks. \r\n\r\nGameplay-wise, it's pretty blah as well. It's mostly the same as 1 and 2 though, so it's more of no big improvements than suckiness. There is one thing that bothers me though: The dice-bowl gambling game has been given a limit. You can only bet 3000 potch at a time! This minigame was a major source of funds in the earlier games in the series, and with this cap, it's hard to keep up with the high blacksmith prices towards the end of the game. \r\n\r\nOne last complaint. This game seems to be technically inferior to Suikoden III. Case in point: cut scenes. It frustrates me that a simple change of perspective/camera angles in cutscenes demands a load time (as in, fade in/fade out) of 0.5-1 seconds. It's the same scene, the models are already loaded in memory, why can't it be a smooth transition? As it is, the cut scenes are jarring and feel skippy. \r\n\r\nThat is all. Will I play it again? Maybe, I really want to use the Soul-Eater again. One nice thing about this game is that for the first time in the series, they include a New game + mode. Not much benefits in terms of carry-over, but one major thing: You can skip cutscenes! But I probably still won't play it again. There are other games to play, and too little time.",

The last time I got into an FPS game multiplayer was when Mon, Dave, Paul and I would do a four-way splitscreen on a single TV with the PS port of Quake 2. Insane I know, but fun. Timesplitters is like that, and since I'm expectedly not-so-good at these types of games, the challenge level is just about right for Alvin and myself. We always go co-op, since I have no doubt he would beat me hand down in versus. \r\n\r\nThe single player game? I have no idea. I let Alvin play that part just to unlock more characters. \r\n\r\nAnd speaking of characters! The real reason I like this game is that the characters are crazy. Alvin likes to play the T-Rex (yes, imagine a T-Rex holding a 12-gauge tactical shotgun), but I try to pick a new one every fight. The most important thing is that the you can be a Ninja Monkey! Wow, I was giggling at that for one whole 30-minute game. \r\n\r\nToo bad Mon is away and we don't hang out much at David's anymore. Otherwise, I'd buy a multitap and we'd lose our eyesight from Dave's samll TV.",

(This fantastic prediction came through SMS of course. Despite my not having a cellphone, I am not outside its' influence.) Since we work on a rather high floor, an earthquake would be very bad &#8482; from us. Of course, nobody took it seriously, although I suspect some wanted to take the opportunity to dodge some work. It's ridiculous after all. There's no real way to predict an earthquake will strike at a certain time.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is, it seems that at least in one other office in the building, the employees were asked to leave the office temporarily \"just in case.\" It's funny when individuals worry about earthquakes predicted by psychic nuns... but when a company decides to take it seriously, well, that's downright stupid.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Sean on 2005-04-15 12:23:00 +0000\r\nYou'd be surprised at how often this happens.

That is, I can know update the layout instantly simply by replacing the stylesheet file used by template (like now!)\r\n\r\nThe new layout uses up a wider screen space, but I think it's neat. The lighter colors are easier on my tired, computer-strained eyes. Hopefully, this new CSS-based design allows me to do more experimentation and improve my ability to design web UIs.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of web UIs, I only recently saw the new look for Yahoo Groups. Similar to the change for the main Yahoo site, it focuses more on lighter colors now, and has significant usage of font coloring to show important points. I like it.

It's less than a year old, and it's target audience is a higher class than the usual malls. It's like it's trying to be something like the Podium, which makes it a bit out of place in Cubao. The mall is good anyway, as you'd expect. Not my type of place to hang out, but has the comforts you'd expect of such a mall... clean, not much of a crowd, and people greeting you when you get off the taxi. It seems a bit tight, though. The hallways are a bit narrow, and the layout is a bit confusing. Or maybe I'm just used to Megamall.\r\n\r\nThe last time I was there, the only thing to see was the Taco Bell. It was therefore my first time at the cinemas there. It's okay.

The whole tale has been told. Revenge of the Sith completes Lucas' space opera. And the Force is strong in this one.\r\n\r\nHighly enjoyable movie, if you take the time to push away your inner critic and look past the spotty acting, the so-so dialogue, and all the little flaws and inconsistencies you spot throughout the movie. Get past all of that, and it's a decent enough ride, and a fitting conclusion to the Star Wars epic.\r\n\r\nSeriously, people need to stop picking it apart and just enjoy the movie. Spoilers follow.\r\n\r\nR2-D2=funny. Apparently that droid can do anything. Imagine having a universal socket that can hack any computer system? Plus apparently he's smart and handy enough to fight off a couple of war droids. Not bad for an Astromech.\r\n\r\nMace Windu vs. Palpatine=good fight. Better than Yoda vs. Palpatine. Mace Windu is obviously better than Yoda at this, probably because he's Morpheus' cousin or something, or so my brother claimed. Speaking of which, my brother, sitting beside me, was cringing all throughout their fight. \"Oh... he's gonna die... he's gonna die... \"\r\n\r\nSeriously, what was up with those 3 Jedi Mace Windu brought with him? They had like 1 hit point each. What was he thinking?\r\n\r\n Anakin: Palpatine is a powerful Sith Lord. You'll need my help.\r\n  \r\n Mace Windu: No way, fool. He's just an old man. These 3 noobs will be enough.\r\n  \r\n (Palpatine kills the 3 noobs almost instantly)\r\n  \r\n Mace Windu: Crap.\r\n\r\nAnakin's turning to the Dark Side was believable enough, given a bit of suspension of disbelief. We should've known it was Padme that would lead to his fall. Too bad Anakin was so gullible... despite Obi-wan praising him for his wisdom. Women... why do they lead us to the dark side?\r\n\r\nGeneral Grievous was boring, kept running away. I hear he was better in the Clone Wars animated series. I'll watch it sometime.\r\n\r\nIf you think about it... all those references to the later trilogy seemed conveniently crammed into the last part of the movie. So don't think about it. Just enjoy the wholeness of the circle. 😀\r\n\r\nOverall, the six-episode story was very good. Lucas' sub-par execution make it an easy target for nitpickers, but the Star Wars mythos as a whole is rock-solid foundation, upon which writers far better than Lucas can improve on.\r\n\r\nThe story from beginning to end is very tight, from Anakin's discovery as the \"one who will bring balance to the force\", to his fall, to the rise of Luke, and eventually to Anakin's redemption and Luke becoming the last from both lines -- Jedi and Sith. And balance is brought to the Force.\r\n\r",

Unlike most other guy kids, I preferred the Transformers to G.I. Joe. I guess I preferred high-tech fantasy over soliders back then, with the war of the heroic Autobots and the Evil Decepticons appealing more to my young mind than soldiers trying to fight terrorists. I watched the show, I read the comics (the first comic series I really collected), I had a lunch box, and I even bought and ate the unhealthy cheap knock-off Transformers-branded chips they sold near the St. Joseph parish.\r\n\r\nTransformers: the Movie was the pinnacle of my childhood experience with the Transformers cartoon, since the seasons following the movie were never broadcast on Philippine TV. I watched it yesterday, hoping I would still find the old charm which enthralled me as a child.\r\n\r\nI was not disappointed. Well, not much anyway. As an adult I've grown more critical of things in general, quick to spot and point out minute flaws. Some notes:\r\n\r\nThe year is 2005 in Transformers the Movie, some 19 years after the movie's actual release. At least they didn't predict flying cars like Back to the Future, but how come we don't yet have cars that look like Hot Rod? The \"futuristic\" look of the six new Autobots introduced in the movie (Ultra Magnus, Hot Rod, Kup, Blurr, Springer and Arcee) give you an indication of how the people of 80s perceived future transportation.\r\n\r\nApparently, Transformers can use lightsabers, er... Laser Swords! Megatron pulls one out during his fatal battle with Optimus Prime, and later in the movie one of the Autobots does too. (I think it was Hot Rod, I forget.)\r\n\r\nAmazingly, while the Autobots and Decepticons never actually hit each other with their weapons in the TV series, their appearance in a movie suddenly made Starscream's use of the Megatron-gun a lot more efficient, accurate and lethal. Ironhide, Prowl, Brawn and Ratchet go down with a single shot each in the first few minutes of the movie. More Autobots died in the first twenty minutes than in the entire run of the series prior to the movie.\r\n\r\nThis wouldn't be much of a problem if the Autobots actually had the same numbers they had in the series. It's a well-known fact that the Autobots greatly outnumbered the Decepticons almost all the time, since there are far more types of cars than there are jets and guns and other stuff. But in the movie, there are apprently less than twenty Autobots still in active service. What happened to the rest? We're limited to Optimus Prime, the more popular first-batch Autobots, the Dinobots and the new guys. The Decepticons get a slightly better deal. They get both the first and second batch of jets, the Constructicons, Insecticons, and even the triple-changers Blitzwing and Astrotrain. Also, I think Blaster's cassette-bots make their first cartoon appearance here. Conspiciously absent are the second set of &#8216;combiner' teams... the Protectobots, Aerialbots, Combaticons and Stunticons. Some of the fights might have gone better had the Autobots thought to bring around Omega Supreme or Skyfire.\r\n\r\nThe Dinobots are apparently stupider than I remember. I guess my memories preferred the comic-book Dinobots, where Grimlock actually managed to become Autobot leader. Here Blurr has trouble convincing them to board a ship.\r\n\r\nIt's too bad the Autobots didn't think of bringing Optimus Prime to the planet of junk, where apprently an Autobot can still live after being blown into some twenty-thousand pieces.\r\n\r\nThe Ultra Magnus character was created solely to have someone fail to be a leader.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough, when the Autobots crash through Unicron's eye, we don't see any sort of optic sensors on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the movie went pretty much as I remembered it. With a lot of forgettable 80s-style music running in the background. Amazingly, at the end, Rodimus Prime declares an end to the Cybertronian wars, and a new era of peace. I don't recall any peace being negotiated with the Decepticons, who looked like they outnumbered the Autobots fifteen-million to one during Unicron's attack.\r\n\r\nI'm quite relieved, as watching the movie failed to change my nostalgic childhood memories of the Transformers, although I still vastly prefer the comic book series. Not at all bad for a series made to sell toys.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by btflpenguin on 2005-05-29 19:45:00 +0000\r\ni loved the transformers! my brother had optimus prime and we used it as my\r\n  \r\nbarbie's mode of transport. pero i stopped watching the cartoons when it got\r\n  \r\nso complicated and there were lots of groups within the autobots and\r\n  \r\ndecepticons. nalipat kami sa voltron and voltes v.\r\n\r\n\\sings\\ the transformers.. more than meets the eye.. autobot (something\r\n  \r\nsomething to) fight the evil forces of the decepticons...",

Oprah's job is nice too. She finds some poor little girl whose dream is to meet a B-list Hollywood celebrity. Wow, how hard was it for her to fulfill that?\r\n\r\nSeriously, I'm sure it's great, it's sweet that Oprah's doing this for the kid, who has some sort of vision-related medical problem. Helping out handicapped kids one at a time is a noble cause, to be sure. But I don't know, it just smacks me as a bit superficial that you would choose the ones with relatively shallow dreams (and conveniently easy for you to accomplish.)\r\n\r\nI have nothing against Ashton Kutcher by the way.

The temperature in my room gets really high during the afternoon, it's quite uncomfortable. Especially since I'm used to wasting away most of my daylight hours in an airconditioned office.\r\n\r\nIt's good to spend a couple of days away from the office though -- God only knows I've been so damn uninspired with work lately. For the past two weeks or so, I haven't had much heart for my work. Most of the time, I code while wondering if I should file for half a day's sick leave and head home. Except that I don't know if boredom is a valid excuse.\r\n\r\n(Madness, despair and self-doubt lay ahead, uncharacteristically. You have been warned.)\r\n\r\nI don't know why. I guess I'm just tired. Tired of overly complicated modules. Tired of badly designed data models. Tired of losing two hours every day to commuting. Tired of the heat. Tired of all the people. And maybe, just maybe, tired of trying to figure out how to win her attention. Just her attention mind you. I would be satisfied with just her attention for a good while, and that says a lot.\r\n\r\nOr maybe I'm just losing my sense of belonging. I like the people at work, I really do. I have friends there. Close friends, even. People whom I've opened up to, shared secrets with, confided in. I don't think I've had any new close friends since the original zu crew. And I like the job, or I wouldn't have stayed this long. And I am quite sure that I am quite good at what I do. So why do thoughts of resigning keep coming up?\r\n\r\nI'm lying to myself of course. I know the reason why it's been so hard to keep a good mood lately. I found out some things I shouldn't have, through methods I should not have used. I did not learn anything I did not already suspect. I had nothing to gain by trying to find out, I knew that knowing these things for certain would shatter me, yet I had to know. So I went ahead anyway. And my heart is paying the price.\r\n\r\nI've been a fool. I know this to be true, I've known it all along. I've always hated letting my emotions get the better of me; I should've held myself back this time same as any other. What made me think it would be any different? What made me think I could fight fate? What made me think I had what it takes?\r\n\r\nAnd now I'm tired. I don't know what to do. I don't know whether I have the strength to go on. There's gap there that I don't know how to traverse. A barrier that only grows stronger as I fight it. Common sense and several people in the know tell me that it's alright to quit. I've fought the good fight, there is no shame in surrender. It happens all the time, people try and people fail.\r\n\r\nThis can't possibly be good for me. Already it's starting to affect my work somehow. And I'm pretty sure that it's holding me back in more ways than that. This isn't going anywhere, and it's making me so frickin' weak. It seems so obvious what needs to be done.\r\n\r\nThen why is it so hard to let go?",

I realize that X-men Evo was not as popular as some of the other superhero series such as Justice League and Teen Titans, but I mostly like it anyway. It's more of a light-hearted version of the X-men universe , really. (Presidential hopeful Senator Kelly of canon is merely Mayoral hopeful Principal Kelly here!) It gets campy at times, but hey, Adam West's Batman was the epitome of campiness, and I enjoyed that too. This task was successfully accomplished.\r\n\r\nFix the home network LAN. Previously we had a problem where the other computer could not use the internet through the gateway machine. Looks like ZoneAlarm was the culprit, as apparently, the free version of ZoneAlarm does not support Internet Connection Sharing. I got the internet working by installing Sygate Personal Firewall instead, although this led to the new problem of the other computer not being able to access shared files/folders on the network. We're keeping it at this state until I can figure out a better solution. This task was successfully accomplished, with complications.\r\n\r\nSolve this Rubik's UFO puzzles (it is already solved in the picture):\r\n\r\n/p \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n/a\r\n\r\nOf course, instead of actually devising a solution to the puzzle, I merely used my google-fu to find a website to help me solve it.\r\n\r\nAll three tasks completed! (Mostly)\r\n\r\nI also managed to sneak in a good part of Crossroads of Twilight (Book 10 of Wheel of Time, more on that in a later post), and two movies: Shrek 2 and the Incredibles. Yes, I had not seen either movie before. And actually, I didn't see them in whole today either. I saw more than half of Incredibles, I think. And most of Shrek 2. Quick reviews, Shrek 2 was the better movie by far. Rib-tickling. I didn't bother seeing it before because it didn't really give me a feeling of being too good, but I was wrong.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/files/rubikufotn.jpg\r",

Someone gave me Crossroads of Twilight as a gift, so I read it and hope that his pacing has improved. It has not. He writes well enough, dialogue is nice, descriptions are more than adequate, but I expect some things to happen in his books! He has so many plots running at once, he should at least resolve two or three per book. Perrin, Mat and Elayne get a lot of chapters, but they barely get anything done. Rand al'Thor himself barely gets one chapter, and I'm thinking it was just put in 'cause people would be pissed if he didn't actually appear in the book. Egwene at least had the good sense to go out and try to do something. Not that she got anywhere sensible of course... \r\n\r\nI swear, with so many things going on, it will take him forever to wrap up this series. And while that may be good for him, I wonder how many people will bother following the books for so long? Especially when they're more of the same... \r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Clair on 2005-05-13 15:27:00 +0000\r\nI like your new layout.

Definitely better than the all the other Batman movies. This movie is no kids' movie either. The movie is less about Batman's crimefighting adventures and more about Bruce Wayne's journey from being a angry, confused rich orphan to the billionaire playboy/costumed vigilante popularized by the earlier films.\r\n\r\nThe movie captures the essence of Batman's character perfectly. It's all about fear &#8212; Bruce overcoming his fear of bats and eventually turning that fear into a symbol to strike terror into the hearts of criminals. The Batman here is nowhere near Joel Schumacher's colorful crusader, or Adam West's \\Biff\\Pow\\Sock\\ type of action. This Batman is a true dark knight, striking from the shadows, unseen, terrifying. I can just imagine the rumors rippling through the underworld during the movie: the Batman is a terrifying monster; he can fly; he can command bats; he is darkness incarnate.\r\n\r\nThe two villains that appear in the movie -- Ra's Al Ghul and Scarecrow -- complement the general fear and deception theme of the movie. Jim Gordon's character is great, although it's a bit weird for me to see Gary Oldman in the role. As for Katie Holmes, well, her character didn't seem to have an important enough role from my point of view. Michael Kaine is a worthy Alfred Pennyworth, and this Alfred seems a bit more smartass than those that appeared in the earlier movies.\r\n\r\nAll in all, worth the watch. The tantalizing hint at the end of the movie suggests a sequel, but the question is, who will play the Joker?\r\n\r\nAlso, we watched in the new cinemas at SM North. Nice, everything seems a lot roomier and the seats were comfy. I didn't get to see what the comfort rooms were like as the movie had me glued to my seat.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by btflpenguin on 2005-06-25 05:50:00 +0000\r\nsaw batman begins 2 days ago. gush gush gush. ang ganda nga!",

Is this still true today, with the advent of digital audio editing? Would people who edit conversations be able to create fake voices that accurately mimic the voiceprint of other people?\r\n\r\nShould there be a way to check if the recordings really have been altered? I don't know if the mobile service providers routinely keep logs of phone calls... but if they do, it should be easy enough to check the recordings against any originals logged by the phone company. Although I guess it would be optimistic to assume that even if they did keep recordings, they would be able keep all their tapes since June of last year. That would consume an awful lot of space.\r\n\r\nI guess that means this is really a wiretap. Of course, it's hard to imagine how the term applies since mobile phones don't have wires. I'm not really aware how one \"taps\" wireless technology. Does it involve some sort of interception of the communications? I would think such communications would be encrypted such that only the authorized recipients would be able to receive and decrypt them. But maybe that's too much to expect... \r\n\r\n [1]: http://news.inq7.net/breaking/index.php?index=1&story_id=39543\r",

You can't skip songs, you can't get to listen to a single track repeatedly, you can't jump to random tracks, you can't listen to only artists that have songs about Superman. Listening to random music some random guy thinks you will like, with no guarantee of whether he actually knows your taste or not. Granted, you can increase that likelihood by listening to the right station, but unless we had one station for every person, it's impossible for the radio station to fully satisfy your tastes.\r\n\r\nRadio is great for two things: news and background filler. And even both these functions can be better fulfilled by other stuff. Why would you bring a radio to work if you had mp3s available? Even if you wanted to pick up new music, the only ones you'll hear on the radio are the popular ones which you'll likely hear from other people anyway. Radio is even more useless in the face of the internet, since even the news function is overshadowed. And there are a lot more online radio stations to choose from than \"physical\" radio stations.\r\n\r\nSomeday, people from the future will laugh at our primitive ways of turning on a machine and hoping it plays what we want and hoping the ads and the silly DJ don't spoil it too much.\r\n\r\nTV is slightly better, since TV programming is supposedly scheduled. But TV's predictability makes it unsuitable for the function of background filler. TV remotes should come with a \"random station\" button. Or you could set a timer that causes the TV to jump to a random station every 30 minutes, or even every minute if you're insane.\r\n\r\nMy brother Brian gets credit for the \"random station button\" idea. Everything should have the ability to be random.\r\n\r",

I'm not sure if they take me up or down the mail-list. Gmail is better, since it explicitly says \"older\" and \"newer\"; With Yahoo, I'm always wrong when I guess. After some experimenting, I figure it out. \"Next\" and \"Previous\" are based on the sort order in the list of messages. Since the default is sorted by date descending (newest first), \"Next\" corresponds to Yahoo's \"older\" by default. Which is kind of hard to figure intuitively. \r\n  In the grid that lists mail messages, I wanted to test if the columns would wrap any words that were too long. Multiple observations here:/p \r\n      As part of this experiment, I wanted to create an email address with a very long name. Apparently, the Yahoo ID \"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz012345\" was already taken. I settled on \"solongandthanksforallthefish2005@yahoo.com\". You can send the account mail if you like. \r\n      There's a UI bug in the password verification screen if the Yahoo ID is too long. The gray box on the left has its right border broken. \r\n      Bummer. I didn't realize the value in the sender column was the name in the Yahoo profile instead of the actual email address. I update the account name to\r\n  \r\n        \"AllTheThingsSheKeepsInsideAreTheThingsThatReallyMatterTheFacePutsOnItsBestDisguiseAndAllIsWellUntilT heHeartBetraysLordBringOutTheLightWrapItAllAroundMeLetItHoldMeTightSoakUpAllThatIBleedLordBringOutTh eLightWrapItAllAroundMeLetItHoldMeTightSoakUpAllThatIBleedIBleedWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWX\",\r\n  \r\n        which breaks even more layouts, including this one (mental note: fix that tomorrow). \r\n      Doh! I actually had to change the Outgoing name, which was set to the original account name. Why doesn't it update the mail setting when I change the (global) Yahoo account setting? Updated it to \"AllTheThingsSheKeepsInsideAreT\" \r\n      I sent some mail messages with the long name and a long subject line. As I suspected... Yahoo compensates for the unwrappable words by expanding the grid cell, breaking the layout. This was a problem I encountered before in the webapps at workand I still don't have a solution that would work in all browsers. \r\n  I'm also interested in how popular webapps handle timestamping, so I try this out as well. For the uninformed, timestamping means handling the case where two people both try to edit the same record at roughly the same time. If there's no handling, the person who updates first usually has his changes lost, without any notification./p \r\n      I try it out first with Yahoo Address Book and Notepad. Both experiments fail... there's no timestamping. I tested it by opening a record (Address Book entry/Notepad note) for updating in two separate Firefox tabs. I update one tab and save, then update the second tab and save. Changes made in the first tab are lost. \r\n      Well, I guess that's okay, since technically, only one person at a time is expected to access these webapps. So I do something else. I create\r\n      \r\n        [\r\n       \r\n        a Yahoo Group][1] \r\n      \r\n        . I get two moderators, me and a dummy email account. I login with both accounts, using Firefox for one and IE for the other. I try to update the group description with one account, then the other. Bam! First guy's changes are lost, without notification! If this were some sort of mission-critical webapp, that would be a dangerous bug. \r\n\r\nI'm sleepy.

That way, I can at least say I'm basing my opinions on known facts unlike roughly 90% of the rest of the participants in this debacle.\r\n\r\nI went through it in about thirty minutes, skimming most and picking out only the parts that seemed most interesting, and skipping anything that was too vague or that I didn't strictly understand the mechanics of.\r\n\r\nThe primary question about this transcript is of course, did Gloria conspire with Garcillano to cheat?

Ok ma’am, mas mataas ho siya pero mag-compensate po sa\r\n  \r\n Lanao yan.\r\n  \r\n GMA: So I will still lead by more than one M., overall?\r\n  \r\n Gary: More or less, it’s the advantage ma’am. Parang ganun din ang lalabas.\r\n  \r\n GMA: It cannot be less than one M.?\r\n  \r\n Gary: Pipilitin ma’am natin yan. Pero as of the other day, 982.\r\n  \r\n GMA: Kaya nga eh... \r\n  \r\n Gary: And then if we can get more in Lanao..\r\n  \r\n GMA: Hindi pa ba tapos?\r\n  \r\n Gary: Hindi pa ho, meron pa hong darating na seven municipalities.\r\n  \r\n GMA: Ah ok, ok.\r\n\r\nThe damning words in this excerpt come from the man named Gary: \"Pipilitin ma'am natin yan.\" (Liberal translation: We will try to make it happen) It implies that Gary was telling GMA that he would do something to manipulate the results to create a 1 million margin of votes. The observant reader should note that (a) GMA did not ask the man Gary to do anything. However, Gary implied doing something illegal which she should have spoken against; and (b) Any manipulation at this point does not seem aimed at stealing a victory, but rather making the victory appear to be a decisive victory\r\n\r\n Conversation between Gary and an unidentified woman believed to be PGMA on 02 22:29 hotel June\r\n  \r\n 04.\r\n  \r\n Gary: Hello, ma’am. Good evening.\r\n  \r\n GMA: Hello, dun sa Lanao del Sur at Basilan, di raw nagmamatch ang SOV sa COC.\r\n  \r\n Gary: Ang sinasabi nya, nawawala na naman ho?\r\n  \r\n GMA: Hindi na nag-match.\r\n  \r\n Gary: Hindi na nag-mamatch? May posibilidad na hindi magmatch kung hindi nila sinunod yung individual SOV ng mga munisipyo. Pero aywan ko lang ho kung sa atin pabor o hindi. Dun naman sa Basilan at Lanao Sur, ito ho yung ginawa nilang magpataas sa inyo, maayos naman ang paggawa eh.\r\n  \r\n GMA: So nag-mamatch?\r\n  \r\n Gary: Oho, sa Basilan, alam nyo naman ang mga military dun eh, hindi masyadong marunong kasi silang gumawa eh. Katulad ho dun sa Sulu, sa General Habatan. Pero hindi naman ho, kinausap ko na yung Chairman ng Board sa Sulu, ang akin, patataguin ko muna ang EO ng Pagundaran na para hindi sila maka-testigo ho. Na-explain na ho yung sa Camarines Norte. Tomorrow we will present official communication dun po sa Senate. Dun ho sa sinasabing wala hong laman yung ballot box. Na-receive\r\n  \r\n ho nila lahat eh.\r\n  \r\n GMA: Oo, oo.\r\n  \r\n Gary: Tumawag ho kayo kanina ma’am?\r\n  \r\n GMA: Yeah, about that Lanao del Sur at Basilan.\r\n  \r\n Gary: Iaano ko na lang ho, nagusap na kami ni Abdullah dun sa kwan kanina. About this, iaano ko ho, wag ho kayong masyadong mabahala. Anyway, we will take care of this. Kakausapin ko rin si Atty.\r\n  \r\n Macalintal.\r\n\r\nAgain, the damning words come from the man named Gary: \"Dun naman sa Basilan at Lanao Sur, ito ho yung ginawa nilang magpataas sa inyo, maayos naman ang paggawa eh.\" (Literal-and-not-too-gramatically-correct translation: In Basilan and Lanao Sur, the increases they did for you, they were done well.)\r\n\r\nThese two excerpts are the most important because, as far as I can tell, these are the only ones that imply the President's direct knowledge of cheating done on her behalf. If they avoid, can get rid of, explain away or otherwise cancel out these two excerpts, GMA can easily avoid culpability from the rest of the transcript. For all we know, there could be some wacky explanation that has a small probability of being true. (\"One million votes? No, we were talking about one million man-minutes spent counting the ballots!\" &#8212; Okay, so I'm not very creative right now. Submit your own wacky explanation!)\r\n\r\nIs she guilty of electoral fraud? Maybe. This tape at best constitutes what I believe to be called prima facie evidence. As we all should know by now however, wiretapped conversations are not admissible in any court of law in the Philippines. Not even in an impeachment trial, which is not really a court of law.\r\n\r\nSome other notes on the tape:\r\n\r\n  There are two other known entities on the tape who can be convicted of electoral fraud. One is of course, the man known as Gary. The other is Robert Barbers. These are the most important people that need to come out and speak their side.\r\n  The man named Gary is obviously Comelec Commissioner Garcilliano, as he is explicitly named several times.\r\n  The phone being tapped was obviously Garcilliano's, as his side is the participant in all conversations.\r\n\r\nThat's all on this matter for now. I will raise more of my own opinions in a later post.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.pcij.org/blog/wp-docs/complete-transcript.pdf\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by btflpenguin on 2005-07-11 21:06:00 +0000\r\nthanks for the summary, now i don't have to read the whole thing (you're right\r\n  \r\nit is boring).",

Even the normally apathetic Engineering students were being woken out of their political stupor by outrage at the turn of events by the Estrada-friendly senators. Everywhere you go in UP, people would be asking you if you were coming to the big rally on EDSA.\r\n\r\nToday? Today, the conversations are like this:\r\n\r\n\"Mag-gimik dapat kami bukas sa Makati eh... \"\r\n\r\n\"May rally daw bukas ah?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oo nga, bad trip nga eh\"\r\n\r\nThat's the biggest problem facing the power-hungry vultures looking for a quick way to oust Gloria. Right now, people just don't care. At least not the people that matter, not the average middle-class joe too busy earning a living, yet not poor enough to be part of a hakot crowd. The current crisis has apparently not yet reached it's breaking point, despite the calls from different sectors for Gloria's head.\r\n\r\nWhy not impeachment, which is a legal avenue made available by the 1986 constitution specifically for such situations? The opposition argues that it is an administration trap, that her allies would merely squelch the investigation. This is madness. The administration would not dare do such a thing, as they know full well the trigger of Erap's downfall was the second envelope fiasco, and any similar attempt at whitewash would be too much of a risk. One of the reasons why not many people aren't too enthusiastic about extraconstitutional methods -- they haven't even tried the legal remedies yet. When those remedies fail, then maybe, just maybe, people might start caring about it.\r\n\r\nYou want to read more opinions? Try my brother Alvin. Or maybe his friend Rey, who seems to be a rather angry young man, yet somehow still comes off as more rational than some of the other participants in this debacle whoa re at least 30 years his senior.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://misterchow.blogspot.com/2005/07/haaay-pilipinas.html\r",

It's okay I guess. When I first heard they were making a Fantastic Four movie, my first reaction was, \"Uh... that can't be good.\"\r\n\r\nThe plot is barely servicable... the thing that really made me think \"suxxor\" was how Victor von Doom's role was handled. I mean, in the comics, Doom was a monarch, ruler of Latveria. He wasn't a madman bent on revenge. He was a madman bent on world domination!\r\n\r\nIn the comics, Dr. Doom is like a machiavellian villain, craving for power, but never exposing himself directly to harm. He'd always get his minions to do dirty work for him, and just when the Fantastic Four thought they had him &#8212; damn, it was a Doombot all along! Curse you, Doom, you got away again! In the movie, Dr. Doom is like, \"Holy crap, I'm bankrupt and Richards stole my girlfriend! I'll use these newly-acquired non-canon cosmic powers to kick his ass! And maybe get into a punching contest with the Thing, or see if I survive a supernova.\"\r\n\r\nAnother thing, the FF hardly do anything \"heroic\" here. The only time they really do a public service (the scene at the bridge) would have been avoided if the Thing wasn't who he was. Yet, despite this, the people of New York (hm... was it New York? Well, the Baxter Building was there, so... ) easily accept them as heroes. This is ridiculous. Movie Spiderman did a whole lot of good deeds, but he received also a whole lot of crap before people started to realize he was a hero. And he's just wearing a mask. What makes people think the people would so easily accept someone like the Thing?\r\n\r\nThe Thing is of course, the most tragic member of the FF, and a good part of the movie focuses on the problems caused by his transformation and his desire to find a cure. To compensate, he gets all the funny scenes, such as they are. There's one that reminds me an old Simpsons joke: \"Your fingers are too fat for this phone... \"\r\n\r\nThe best thing about this movie? The Fantastic Four are represented quite accurately.\r\n\r\n(Edit 11-Jul-2005: Actually, the best parts were those involving the Thing and thr Torch. Reed was pretty much what I expected, but Sue's character was quite weak, and at some points Jessica Alba seemed uncomfortable with it. It can't be helped though, as before Franklin was born, Sue Storm-Richards had the weakest character development in the comics, and her lacking role in the movie simply reflects that.)\r\n\r\nThe worst thing about this movie? Doctor Doom and the people of New York are not.\r\n\r\nThe best line in the movie?\r\n\r\n\"It's clobbering time.\"",

(Please don't lecture me in any way on piracy, I've said my piece before.)\r\n\r\nIn any case, we have spent at least ten thousand pesos (roughly two hundred american) on pirated PS2 games. And out of those hundred copies, some games we have two or three copies of (due to the problems generally associated with illegal copies); Out of all those pirated games, I'd make a conservative estimate that at least 20 games were actually playably good. We got good playing time out of them, and it was a good experience overall. So the effective cost per good game comes out to around five hundred pesos (roughly ten american dollars). This number is important, because this magic number is the price at which it becomes worthwhile for us to buy an original game.\r\n\r\nWhen I make a game, I will price it in this range.\r\n\r",

And lo, I was lucky enough to find a copy of the fifth book of Stephen King's epic western fantasy, The Dark Tower. It was a huge book, larger than my copies of the first four, but with the same cover style and by the same publisher, so it was the copy I wanted. I spent less than a hundred pesos on it.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that I once again journeyed into the world/s of the Dark Tower, following the path of Roland of Gilead and his ka-tet of gunslingers along the path of the Beam, heading inexporably towards the Dark Tower.\r\n\r\nThe Dark Tower series has always been a weird sort of hybrid. Primarily a western, set in a fantasy multiverse which intersects with multiple versions of our own reality, Roland and his posse find themselves facing robots, bears, wizards, psychotic trains, undead and such. This time they face \"Wolves\", an unknown new enemy who plague a farming community along the path of the Beam. Like any good RPG-party, the gunslingers decide to offer aid to the people of the Calla, though not all would accept their help. In exchange, they are granted the power to travel back to New York, the nexus of all New Yorks, where they must protect the Rose, an incarnation or manifestation of the Dark Tower.\r\n\r\nThe one thing I did not like about this copy: It had illustrations. Normally, that would be a good thing, but I find I did not really want to know what Roland of Gilead looked like, even to another person, as it spoiled my own vision of what the book tells me. That's how good the series is &#8212; it's the type of series where you form your own version of it in your head and you are completely drawn into its saga.\r\n\r\nAs always, the book is dark and compelling. Despite the hectic work schedule last week, I finish the thick book in less than four days, and the volume ends in cliffhanger, as the ka-tet is broken. Two more books to go before the end of their quest; I can only hope the last two come out in my preferred format soon.",

But I know some people who are big fans, so I respect his work at least. Neverwhere is only the second Gaiman book I've read (well, third maybe, I think I read that thing he co-wrote about the apocalypse), and I'm pretty much satisfied so far.\r\n\r\nNeil Gaiman does fantasy. Not medieval fantasy or sci-fi or anything like that, but fantasy in modern-day settings. Neverwhere takes place in London, a place with which the author seems intimately familiar. Except that his fictional London is divided into two cities -- London Above, which is the normal everyday London, and London Below, a temming network of underground locations where people fall through cracks and disappear. Something like that.\r\n\r\nOur protagonist is an ordinary guy, who meets a resident of London Below, and is thereupon plunged into it's mad, mystical world, where the familiar laws of reality seldom seem to apply. The plot is nothing extraordinary, one you may have read in some form or other: Our intrepid hero meets an interesting cast of unlikely allies and they band together on a quest, ultimately saving the universe. Something like that. It's Gaiman's writing that stands out though; his flowery prose and florid descriptions brings the fantasy world of London Below to life, presenting a striking contrast to the protagonist's boring life in London Above.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a good read. Nothing extraordinarily deep, but enough to make me interested in reading more Gaiman.",

Some of the story-related parts might get you a bit sleepy, especially if you weren't particularly fond of the whole Reunion/Jenova/planet thing from Final Fantasy VII, but that's okay because... \r\n\r\n... the actions scenes are flat-out spectacular! Seriously, the fight scenes from the trailer were incredibly cool, but the ones that you see in the movie itself, wow. It's a good thing Square is really good at CGI, there's no way those scenes could have been done with live action.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of CGI, the quality of their work has definitely improved since Spirits Within. (Red XIII could use some work though.) I wish Spirits Within had had this level of awesomeness, but Advent Children has the advantage of a whole game of backstory with which the audience is already assumed to be familiar.\r\n\r\nAnd for those skeptics who question how Cloud could possibly swing around that big-ass sword of his, better not watch this one as Cloud now fights with a big-ass sword in each hand!\r\n\r\nIf you are an FF7 fan of any sort, watch it.

It's hard to stop! \r\n\r\nIn case you haven't heard, World of Warcraft is Blizzard's MMORPG take on it's famous RTS series, and it's one helluva good game. It looks excellent, the gameplay is terrific, people don't seem to be assholes, etc. The only real downside is that it's hard to stop playing! \r\n\r\nBlizzard seems to have hit the sweet spot of the mythical RPG spiral: you always have that urge to go for one more creep, one more quest, one more level, and it repeats ad infinitum. \r\n\r\nIt's very hard to get bored with the game, especially if you're a true-blue follower of the Warcraft series. You get to immerse yourself in famous locations and meet characters and heroes from the RTS games. You get to do quests, literally dozens of quests throwing themselves on you. You get to customize your character. You get to wander off to gather obscure ingredients. You get to interact with other players, challenge them, fight alongside them, raid whole cities with them. \r\n\r\nI've tried a few other MMOs before, and none really struck me so hard as WoW... other games get you hopelessly stuck in the levelling \"grind\", but WoW throws so much stuff to do at you that it's very easy to forget about that level bar. \r\n\r\nI recommend the game to any serious gamer, even to those who primarily like single-player RPGs. Because honestly, you can play WoW just like a single-player RPG with a vast multitude of quests (except that you occasionally get some other characters helping you out randomly). I'll play again in a short while :p\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by btflpenguin on 2005-09-09 04:27:00 +0000\r\nmy MMORPG addiction is Guild Wars. graduated to that from ROSE Online. The\r\n  \r\ngame is similar to Ragnarok but the graphics are way more sophisticated. you\r\n  \r\nmay want to try it (that is if you want to spend more than your WoW 3-4 hours\r\n  \r\nplaying).\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2005-09-09 14:55:00 +0000\r\nNah, I'm good 😀\r\n\r\nI think the 3-4 hours per day may be underestimated though. Sometimes it's\r\n  \r\ncloser to 9-10. :p\r\n\r\n Comment by btflpenguin on 2005-09-10 04:26:00 +0000\r\ni know what you mean. i sometimes spend the whole saturdays playing, only\r\n  \r\nstopping to nibble when i get faint of hunger. it's addicting to control your\r\n  \r\ndestiny. i think that's why i keep playing. you get more control over your\r\n  \r\nlife online as a character (and if you should f--k up, it only takes a few\r\n  \r\nsecs to respawn).",

I couldn't find any succinct way to put it.\r\n\r\nAnyway, yeah. I'm supposed to be trying to get a phone. People have been harassing me for years about the fact that I don't have a phone. Since my vacation is already half-wasted already, I figure I'd go online and get some info on what phone I'd buy.\r\n\r\nNow, bear with me a bit, I'm really stupid when it comes to phones, since I've practically never owned one. If there's any better way or better place to look for the info than the way I describe here, tell me about it. 😀\r\n\r\nFirst, to find out what are the available phones and their features, I check the website of one of the major providers to see what handsets they list, since supposedly this tells me what models are available locally. FYI, I chose to use Smart's website \r\n\r\nNow, this helps me find phones which have features I like. But the Smart website only gives me prices offered by Smart when the phone is tied to one of their plans. Let's assume I want a bit more flexibility and don't want to be tied to the plan. I have no idea where to check the prices though, so I hit two auction sites instead: ebili and bidshot, so I can get some idea what people are willing to pay for these models.\r\n\r\nEasy enough right? Check the features, cross-check the prices, choose a phone. Some notes on these websites:\r\n\r\nSmart: Why the hell is the list of phones not sorted in any logical order? None that I can see anyway. When I see a cheap, er, reasonably-priced phone on the auction sites, I want to check the features of that phone on the Smart website but it takes me a while to find it. Some sort of search feature would have been nice. (Or maybe there is one and I missed it?)\r\n\r\nEbili/Bidshot: Why the hell is the search result list not sortable in any way? If you have a grid of search results, I don't see how difficult it is to implement sortable columns; every single webapp I've worked on has this feature! I was almost tempted to send them an email offering my services as a freelancer to implement reasonable searching features such as sorting and filtering. These are NOT difficult things to implement, I don't know why we don't see them in all websites; I can understand the performance concern if you're potentially returning millions of hits (i.e. Google), but these searches have hits ranging in dozens, sorting performance hit should be minimal.\r\n\r\nThat is all, just wanted to rant. And no, I have not chosen a phone yet.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.smart.com.ph/SMART/Catalog/Handsets/\r\n [2]: http://ebili.com\r",

Korina referred to him as a millionaire because of his share from the match, but Manny said he's going to be giving a lot of it away. People told him to donate to Katrina, but he says there are also a lot of needy people in his own country so he's giving to them first.

Today, for the first time in maybe twenty years, I saw an exciting action-packed episode of the A-Team!\r\n\r\nFor those not in the know, the A-Team was a bunch of rogue ex-commandos who usually acted as mercs, fighting for good, beating bad guys and saving the day. In the parlance of Roland of Gilead, gunslingers.\r\n\r\nThe A-Team TV series was most famous for having as one of its cast the now-popular-on-the-internet tough-talking, fool-pitying Mr. T. I also particularly like the antics of their resident screwball flyball, \"Crazy Man\" Murdock.\r\n\r\nI remember that Marvel even had an A-Team comic book out when I was a kid; I had an issue or two. I'm tempted to go out and look for copies of those now. 😀\r\n\r\nIt was a good episode too, but ended with a cliffhanger. It's a good thing I'm free to watch the next episode tomorrow. 😀\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.mrtvseverything.com/\r",

Since I had just finished the fifth book of Stephen King's western fantasy, I started this task with Sergio Leone's western opus, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.\r\n\r\nI haven't watched many westerns before. This is probably the first one I completed. And you know what it reminds me of? Dragonball. Ages of staring at each other, hands hovering over your guns, ending in two seconds of gunfire. I know they're a lot more speak-y in Dragonball, but it gave me the same feeling... the anticipative build-up and the big, explosive finish.\r\n\r\nGod, that was a long movie. I think it clocked in at 2:45 or so. It was mistake to watch this movie in late afternoon, as I started getting drowsy towards the end.\r\n\r\nI've never seen Clint Eastwood this young before! But he reminds me of how I usually visualize Roland of Gilead. And the impossibly good shooting in the movie seems characteristic of Roland's gunslingers as well.\r\n\r\nGood movie, though longish.\r\n\r",

Seagate Barracuda 7200. Yessir, ups the total hard drive capacity at home to 240 gigs, I hope we don't fill it up too fast.\r\n\r\nMoved the 40GB hard drive on the primary computer to the secondary (for a total of 80 on the secondary), and installed the new one on the primary. My brother Alvin was working with me on this, and it took us a better part of three hours to get the connection right (one of the casings wasn't very agreeable)\r\n\r\nInstalled a fresh XP on the primary, that took a while. Almost immediately after setting up the network/internet the first time, got smacked by a couple of trojans and a virus, seemed to have lost some important system files as everything went wonky. Lesson learned, I reinstalled XP clean and this time, I installed my free antivirus package of choice before starting the internet connection.\r\n\r\nI learned something new today. It seems the OS has some sort of limit on the partition size? It wouldn't let me install it as a single 160Gb partition, so I had to settle for a 128 gig main partition and a 21 gig secondary (the unfortunately uneven division due to my not knowing how to handle the situation correctly during the initial install). Ten gigabytes lost, bummer.\r\n\r\nEverything seems fine now. Took me most of the night (up to 2AM) to transfer the files from the old hard drive (across the network cable). On hindsight, next time I should try to see if some disk-imaging utility would be better.\r\n\r\nNotes for next time:\r\n\r\n  Make sure all the installers are handy before starting. We were pretty lucky this time. 😀\r\n  Apparently, the order in which the hard drives are connected on the IDE cable does matter\r\n  Divide the partitions neatly\r\n  Install antivirus before opening internet connection.\r\n  See if a disk-imaging utility can be used to transfer the files/OS/settings\r\n\r\nThat is all.\r\n\r",

I'd post a picture, but I can't find the digicam, and the phone can't take a picture of itself.\r\n\r\nThe 6020 itself seems pretty okay, although as a phone newbie I really have not much of a basis for comparison. The camera is nifty, but it took me a while to find a data cable for the phone. And now I can annoy people by SMS! (Not that I do, just that I can.)\r\n\r\nI am of course fairly good with technical stuff, but also a newb with regards to phones. Being so, I have had trouble setting up things like MMS/GPRS/Email using the phone. I did have the GPRS up the other day, but then I downloaded some setting using Nokia's service, and I lost it. Oh yeah, I'm on Globe.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Globe, is their customer support service really so bad? In this internet day and age, why do I have to call a hotline or go to a Globe store to get help in setting up my phone service settings?

Any nontrivial software system should have some sort of journalling scheme involved, as printlogging is usually part and parcel of the development process.\r\n\r\nIdeally, I would wish that life too had a journalling system, one more reliable and less arcane than that gift humans call memory. I sometimes have trouble remembering what I had for breakfast this morning. Okay, that's a lie, I seldom forget about meals less than a week old.\r\n\r\nBut I do have a tendency to forget other things. Tasks to do, people I've met, appointments I've set. A Saturday or so (I forget when), I had set a training meeting at 10am. Of course, my job does not require me to be in the office before noon on Saturdays, so I conveniently forgot about the meeting while playing World of Warcraft, recalling such appointment only while taking a bath at 10:30am. (Luckily they didn't mide me re-scheding to 11:30)\r\n\r\nSo, frail as our memories are, we resort to other things to keep us on track. Paper, notebooks, to-do-lists, organizers, calendars, cellphones, PDAs, sticky notes and every so often, the proverbial rubber-band-around-the-finger. (Yes, I have done that, and yes I did forget what the rubber band stood for.)\r\n\r\nBlogging, is of course, one of those outlets, one of those forms of introspection so commonplace on the web nowadays. I started quite some time ago, on another server, and have kept up, a bit sporadically if I might add. I've never been entirely too sure of my own reasons for blogging. Some parts ego, some parts experimentation, some parts therapy, perhaps some part exhibitionism? In any case, though I have considered several times to abandon this practice, especially when I have been too lazy to pursue it for months on end, I find myself giving it another go eventually. Because life should have an audit trail.\r\n\r\nShall I offer some excuse of why I have been so long without an entry? Some vague representations of WoW addiction, business at work or general laziness? I just did.\r\n\r\nIn any case, our story continues... \r\n\r",

Growing up, her father never taught her to read or write, only to fight. She grew up knowing only one language -- body language. Her mind processes human motions as fluently as ordinary people speak their native tongue. She can see moves before they happen or read a person's intentions simply by following their movement patterns. She was an experiment to create the ultimate human fighting machine. At the age of eight, she made her first kill. Then she ran away. She wound up in Gotham, under the tutelage of the Dark Knight. She has become Batgirl.\r\n\r\nI read through the current 70 issues over the weekend. It's pretty good. Batgirl almost always faces up against normal people -- goons, thugs, mafia and whatnot. She's not metahuman either, but her superior abilities allow her to dodge bullets and kill with her bare hands (Not that she does kill mind you, but she CAN.) The fact that she's illiterate and basically ignorant of how to interact with the rest of society makes the comic all the more interesting and provides a lot of room for her to grow as a character.\r\n\r\nThe only thing I don't like about trying to follow a single comic series -- crossovers.

Any serious gamer worth his salt knows about it -- whether he plays turn-based strategy games or not. And the fourth installment was eagerly awaited in our home -- two out of four brothers were eager to play the latest update.\r\n\r\nAnd Civ4 is in many ways the same game all over again. The basic premise is still there -- explore, build cities, research technologies, kick other civivlizations while they're down, race to space, etc. But several other new features have kicked in, many of them adding a new layer of management complexity to the already complex strategy game. Great Persons, National Wonders, cultural expansion, luxury resources... well, I'm not sure if some of these are new since Civ3 -- I didn't play that one much. The most important change has to be the streamlining of the interface such that it becomes easy to tell at a glance what a city is building and how long it takes for it to grow.\r\n\r\nAnyway, as expected, the game is still incredibly engrossing. I sat down yesterday morning to \"just give it a try\", and after what seemed like a few short turns found myself contemplating whether to nuke the Arabians in the early 17th century.\r\n\r\nSo yeah, awesome Civ4 gameplay, as expected. I finished two games in short order, one took me 4 hours because the silly Germans and Spanish kept trying to declare war on me, and I had to be satisfied with a Time Victory. The second took less than two hours -- full peace/diplomacy, science/culture all the way, never entered a state of war.\r\n\r\nBut I'm not playing it again. Why? Because the game's performance is crap-tastic! You can play smoothly found maybe 5-10 minutes before the game starts slowing to a crawl. Going to the lowest possible settings and quitting all running programs doesn't help at all. Apparently I'm not alone, as I've seen numerous message board posts lambasting Firaxis for the terrible performance of the game regardlesss of the system running it.\r\n\r\nIt's a testament to both the addictiveness of the gameplay and how much patience I've gained recently that I was able to finish two games at all. But as it is, I'm not playing it again until some radical performance improvment happens.\r\n\r\nMaybe I can still find a copy of Civ3...",

From the ten or so hours I've played it's definitely a lot better than the previous game in the series. And the voice acting is really great this time, with a bunch of British people doing the over-the-top voices. The battle system is still a bit simplistic, and the main quest seems very straightforward. From what I've seen, it's probably an above average game. \r\n\r\nThat's the problem. I don't have time for above average games. It was okay when I was still in school and had tons of free time, I could afford to waste my time with midcarders like Legend of Legaia or Wild Arms, but these days there are so many things competing for my attention (thanks DSL), and work sched is a lot more tight than school, so I have to be a LOT more selective in my choice of distractions. \r\n\r\nAnd \"above-average\" just doesn't make the cut anymore.",

But I do know what I like, and I know I like the Eraserheads' music. If you don't know who the &#8216;heads are, they're basically the Beatles of the Philippines, galvanizing the local music industry and serving as an example and inspiration to numerous other bands that followed after them. It's only fitting then that many of the current crop of Filipino performers pay tribute to them in the form of Ultraelectromagnetic Jam. This fantastic album features several artists performing their own versions of some of the Eraserheads best hits, namely:\r\n\r\n  Alapaap by 6-Cycle Mind\r\n  Alcohol by Radioactive Sago Project\r\n  Ang Huling El Bimbo by Rico J Puno\r\n  Hard to Believe by Cueshé\r\n  Huwag Kang Matakot by Orange and Lemons\r\n  Huwag Mo Nang Itanong by MYMP\r\n  Ligaya by Kitchie Nadal\r\n  Magasin by Paolo Santos\r\n  Maling Akala by Brownman Revival\r\n  Overdrive by Barbie Almabis\r\n  Pare Ko by Sponge Cola\r\n  Spoliarium by Imago\r\n  Superproxy by Francis M.\r\n  Tikman by Sugarfree\r\n  Torpedo by Isha\r\n  Para sa Masa by all of them!\r\n\r\nI wanted to comment on each track separately, but I'm too lazy :p They're all pretty good, mostly because the originals were great in the first place. Paolo Santos carried Magasin surprisingly well, and Superproxy was just the right track for Francis M. Radioactive Sago's Alcohol is hilarious, and I like the way Orange and Lemons mixed a little bit of Julie Tearjerky and Tikman in Huwag Kang Matakot. I also think I actually like Cueshé's version of Hard To Believe better than the original. My least favorite track on the album is Kitchie Nadal's Ligaya, (cute laugh on the \"inaahit\" bit notwithstanding) as I really prefer the more upbeat original.\r\n\r\nI wish more bands had contributed to the effort though, as the &#8216;heads probably deserve it. According to my brother, the participating artists were all from the same recording studio (I don't really pay attention to studios, so yeah I'll just agree here.) Still, it would've been nice to hear some renditions from &#8216;heads contemporaries like Rivermaya and Parokya ni Edgar.\r\n\r\nAll in all, awesome album. If you have listened to the Eraserheads music at one time or another, go find a way to get it.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eraserheads\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by jacky on 2006-07-20 09:55:13 +0000\r\ngoodwork guys and thank you for having Cueshe in\r\n\r\nULTRAELECTROMAGNETIC album i realy realy appreciate that\r\n\r\nim Jacky proud to be Cueshean (\";)",

One of them was apparently a wisdom tooth that had lodged itself in a peculiar angle. That one required surgery (and was not covered by my health card).\r\n\r\nWhen you're there, even when your mouth is numb, even if you're not really scared or anything, once you start to feel that pressure on your jaw, you can't help but be at least a little bit anxious. It's not so much whatever pain gets through the anesthesia that's annoying. It's the fact that you're mentally anticipating that pain. When you start to feel the dentist pushing and pulling at your tooth, you can't help but worry that somewhere, some resilient little nerve of yours has avoided the anesthesia and is just waiting to send you into a world of pain.\r\n\r\nLuckily, not only is my dentist very good, but I'm quite comfortable with her, despite the often corniness of her jokes :p\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Sean on 2005-12-11 14:08:00 +0000\r\nOuch.

I still have a lot of thoughts running around my head, and often throughout the day I find myself thinking, \"I should post an entry about this.\" But at the end of the day, I'm tired and I'm exhausted from thinking about two hundred different issues and juggling twenty different priorities, so I don't post about it. I note it somewhere and sooner or later it becomes irrelevant and I forget why I wanted to post it in the first place.\r\n\r\nI remarked to one of my coworkers that I often find myself remembering dozens of things in my head simultaneously and he of course reminded me of the popular notion that human beings can only remember seven things at any one time. It's the concept of limitation in humans' short-term memory or RAM.\r\n\r\nThis is probably mostly true, but as I've gotten more and more used to this multitasking mode of mine, I've found that the seven most important things stay on top, but the rest don't really disappear. They fall away for a while, swallowed into your subconscious, only to rear their ugly head again later once you have some free RAM again.\r\n\r\nMy current role at work forces me to be locked in this mode for most of the day. As one of the senior technical guys, I typically field dozens of technical questions from junior developers during a single day and when somebody's problem can't be solved quickly I physically get up from my desk and go walk them through it. And that's just the queries regarding concerns outside my own project. Aside from that I often have to worry about scheduling, technical risks, physical designs and of course the occasional invitation to go down and buy some food.\r\n\r\nDeveloper multitasking is generally looked-down upon in the tech world I know; people are encouraged to work directly on one task at a time to give them focus. Maybe most people have some short period of time at the start of the day to reply to emails and address issues raised by other people. I wish I could have that sort of luxury, but it seems to me that every issue or problem raised to me needs to be resolved five minutes ago. People can't continue coding unless I help them. Schedules can't be finalized until I give my input. Developers can't write program specifications until I hand in the database design. I literally have dozens of dependencies.\r\n\r\nSo, how do I cope? Simple, I cope the only way I know how. By instinct. This would be a terrifying revelation to anyone I actually work with, but during working hours I'm typically buried under so many issues, my only recourse is to dismiss as many as I can as quickly as possible, and that requires a whole lot of working from my gut.\r\n\r\nLuckily, my gut has gotten really good at this. But I'm pretty sure all the people who are incredibly organized and have moleskin notebooks and stuff would tear their hair at such an unorganized method (or is it madness?). And I know, I'm trying to get organized, I really am. I have to-do lists, a couple of dozen that tell me what I should be doing. I have log files that theoretically tell me what I've been doing all day. I try to turn off my email client sometimes, even though I will inevitably have people coming up to me and asking if I'd seen the mail they just sent.\r\n\r\nBut I can't help it. That's the role I play. People expect me to help them, to provide them guidance. I've projected myself as being open to consultations, and the company and all of my coworkers appreciate that. And even then I still have my own tasks to perform. I'm considering suggesting to the company that I never be considered working on a project for more than a 50% allocation. The other 50% should be allocated to my on-the-fly firefighting tasks.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, especially during the past couple of weeks, I've found myself mentally exhausted. I have a very easy time separating work from personal life, because by the time I step into the elevator after logging out I'm already too tired to even think about work issues.\r\n\r\nNot that I have a bad job, mind you. It's awesome. But I guess sometimes I toss myself into it a bit too much. When my personal load is light, I can easily handle everything tossed at me and people go \"You're awesome!\" and I nod and address the next crisis. But when my load is heavy, well, then things really get exciting.\r\n\r\nI forgot what my point was now, as I unconsciously launched into a narrative of how my typical day goes. I'm still getting by with my gut, but I know from experience that gut instinct only gets you so far. Sooner or later, something's gonna give and I'll need to find some way to make sure I can carry this level of awesome-ness to the next level.\r\n\r\nOh, and yeah I changed layouts.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Dave on 2006-02-01 21:36:00 +0000\r\nEi Roy,\r\n\r\nWhile it's kewl that you can handle the stress of fielding all those \"help me\"\r\n  \r\ncalls, that's not a healthy company practice... \r\n\r\nWell, it's certainly got good and bad going for it. It's good because everyone\r\n  \r\nrealizes how utterly indispensable you are, so you'll never be fired. Other\r\n  \r\nstuff too.\r\n\r\nI think tho' that there's more bad than good in it...  There's the stress,\r\n  \r\nwhich is one thing. And there's also the probability that this role you have\r\n  \r\nassumed will make the bosses pass you over for promotions because you'll be\r\n  \r\nconsidered too valuable where you are for doing stuff that's not formally\r\n  \r\nyours to do (unless it's really part of your job description to be techno fire\r\n  \r\nfighter).\r\n\r\nAnyway, nothing, just wasting time after being flabbergasted by C. Bolastig's\r\n  \r\nforward to the list.\r\n\r\nSomething you might want to do eventually is to formalize the firefighting\r\n  \r\nthing by having people do it through a standard procedure instead of actively\r\n  \r\npinging your person with stuff. Like, maybe if someone has a problem they\r\n  \r\ncan't work through on their own, they should have to fill out a template\r\n  \r\ne-mail form about it to send to you so you can quickly go over it or\r\n  \r\nsomething. I'm sure \\somebody\\ in some Japanese company has a well structured\r\n  \r\nprocess for doing this kind of technical advising instead of you having to go\r\n  \r\nthrough many that you have to gut it out =P\r\n\r\nI mean, you can manage the load now, but if your company ever expands... \r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2006-02-01 22:57:00 +0000\r\nEh, I'm fine.\r\n\r\nI wrote this towards the end of a particularly heavy week. While what I do\r\n  \r\neveryday closely approximates what I wrote here, it seldom reaches the stress\r\n  \r\nlevels that the essay could imply.\r\n\r\nIn the case of promotions, your concern is unneeded, as there's really no such\r\n  \r\nthing as a \\promotion\\ in our company which has a flat hierarchy thingy.\r\n  \r\nBesides, one of my roles in the current project is Technical Lead, which means\r\n  \r\nthat it actually \\is\\ my job to handle technical questions within the project.\r\n\r\nThe fact that I also handle a good number of technical concerns from \\outside\\\r\n  \r\nthe project is a result of two concepts: mentoring and subject experts; I\r\n  \r\ndon't know how it works in other industries, but typically in software, senior\r\n  \r\ndevelopers are expected to mentor junior developers to help them gain\r\n  \r\nexperience/knowledge. And there's a particular reporting tool we use where I'm\r\n  \r\nconsidered as the sole \"subject expert\" on its' use, so almost all technical\r\n  \r\nquestions concerning this tool are handled by me.\r\n\r\nThere are formal procedures for pretty much everything, including sending\r\n  \r\nclarifications, and most people will always ask if I'm busy before sending\r\n  \r\nsomething my way. But I guess it's actually my own preference to answer as\r\n  \r\nmany clarifs as quickly as I can. I'm also pretty sure that addressing each\r\n  \r\nissue as soon as it possibly can is the best way to go; (This is one of the\r\n  \r\noverriding philosophies in the Getting Things Done methodology esposed by\r\n  \r\nDavid Allen) If I let the questions pile up I'd have a long list of them which\r\n  \r\nwould be daunting to go through.\r\n\r\nIt's not like I'm doing ten thousand things at once; I at least know how to\r\n  \r\nsequence my tasks. If I'm in the middle of something which requires 100% of my\r\n  \r\nconcentration, I will typically ignore most incoming requests until I can get\r\n  \r\nto some break point which allows me to successfully shift gears. And in some\r\n  \r\ncases I will even welcome the distraction; somehow my mind thinks better after\r\n  \r\nI have temporarily focused on some other problem.\r\n\r\nThe firefighting thing takes up 50% of my time at most, and only if I allow it\r\n  \r\nto. I always have the option of saying I don't have time or asking somebody to\r\n  \r\ncheck it for me.\r\n\r\n\"I mean, you can manage the load now, but if your company ever expands... \"\r\n\r\nNote that I never said I was the only one doing this. 😀 In fact, I think the\r\n  \r\ncurrent practice is scaling pretty-well re: the size of the company. We have\r\n  \r\nroughly 160 people working in technical positions, and I'm one of maybe around\r\n  \r\n5-8 who can handle these concerns on the same level (or better). About two\r\n  \r\nyears ago, there were around 3 such guys to handle concerns for around 80\r\n  \r\npeople.\r\n\r\nMy current workload levels are more of a problem of lack of senior developers\r\n  \r\nassigned to our project more than anything else, and despite that I still do\r\n  \r\nnot normally work overtime. Today was awesome though, with all the work I\r\n  \r\nmanaged to clear last week, it seems like all the heavy lifting had already\r\n  \r\nbeen done and most of my day was pretty light 😀\r\n\r\n Comment by Roy on 2006-02-01 23:08:00 +0000\r\nAs an additional note, it's not even limited to work-related stuff. I think\r\n  \r\nthis way even for stuff \\outside\\ of work.\r\n\r\nAt any one time I have several personal projects I want to push through with,\r\n  \r\na lot of stuff I want to try, stuff I want to read, etc.\r\n\r\nNow that I think about, the way I handle the work stuff is a lot better than\r\n  \r\nhow I handle the non-work stuff. I guess what want out of all of this is a\r\n  \r\nbetter way to organize my own thinking =p",

That so perfectly described the end of the last year, as things changed around me and just naturally fell into positions where I would be able to leave them behind. Things changed, things I had known for a long time and taken from granted.\r\n\r\nI look forward to the coming year. A new beginning I suppose. I hope it's interesting at least.",

Crowding to get into the one-year anniversary show of a local noontime variety show. Wowowee.\r\n\r\nThis is ridiculous, an obvious barometer showing how desperate many of our countrymen have become. The show was offering prizes in the form of raffle draws and contests, and many were hoping to win a house and lot or at least some cash to help them get by. Many of them were poor and coming from far-flung places even outside the metro.\r\n\r\nShocking how these people look up to Willy Revillame, host of Wowowee, as some sort of Messiah who can uplift them out of their poverty. And some paid dearly with their lives.\r\n\r\nI remember during the days of the \"Pera o Bayong\" contest that there would be literally hundreds of would-be contestants hanging out near the ABS-CBN compound hoping to win a big prize. I remember thinking that these people spend hours in line, many probably coming back day after day; if they could just devote themselves to some sort of honest work they would have had far better chances of improving their lives.\r\n\r\nWhile I say a prayer for those whose lives were lost, I'm glad I have the luxury of thinking that crowding in with thirty thousand people for a chance to win some cash is just too much hassle.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://news.inq7.net/nation/index.php?index=1&story_id=65164\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by dave on 2006-02-06 03:57:53 +0000\r\nEi Roy,\r\n\r\nThis actually made me think of one of those Discovery programs I saw a while\r\n  \r\nback, about how the Battle Of Agincourt during the Hundred Years war may\r\n  \r\nactually have been the French being defeated by themselves and the terrain\r\n  \r\nrather than any special prowess of the English (although it probably helped to\r\n  \r\nhave arrows raining down on them, even if the arrows couldn't penetrate their\r\n  \r\narmor).\r\n\r\na href=\"http://www.crowddynamics.com/Battlefield%20Detectives/Agincourt.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\"http://www.crowddynamics.com/Battlefield%20Detectives/Agincourt.htm/a\r\n\r\nOnce a crowd gets to a certain size, nothing is as dangerous as their\r\n  \r\ninteraction with barriers around them. Once people start crowding in front and\r\n  \r\nthe ones in the back don't realize the ones in front are impeded, the pushing\r\n  \r\nof the ones in the back easily propagates and gets amplified by layers of\r\n  \r\nother people pushing until the front ranks are crushed.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2006-02-06 15:18:42 +0000\r\nI skimmed over the link, and my first thought was: those guys need more micro!\r\n\r\nI think the same applies to the Wowowee people.",

If you're used to reading Adams go on about Induhviduals and stupid managers, or if you've never read Adams trying / pretending to sound philosophical in one of his books, then this isn't what you'd expect.\r\n\r\nAdams describes it as a \"thought experiment\" of sorts, one where he tries to provide some sort of explanation for basically life, the universe and everything. Although it's a work of fiction, it sounds like Adams is trying to see how people will react to his form of philosophy &#8212; it seems to be one of his favorite things to do something just to provoke reactions. (Yeah, he and I are alike that way.)\r\n\r\nAdams starts from simple assumptions about the nature of God, and the nature of probability, and proceeds to try to explain everything from gravity to string theory to psychics to women. Yeah, women. You'd think a guy would know better.\r\n\r\nIt's a thought-provoking read, as long you keep some of the skepticism down. Adams himself acknowledges that some parts of his book are just plain-old creative BS trying to pass itself off as something deeper. Smart people would appreciate it as quick and light-philosophical reading, but I don't think it would survive serious logical scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThat being said, it's definitely worth the read, if only to get inside the head of a popular cartoonist. I think this part of Scott Adams is the part that writes all those garbageman strips. =p\r\n\r",

For some reason, I took the opportunity to vanish into the shadows and watch as the buses left me behind. I roamed around the small town, hoping to find some sort of means with which I could escape my mundane life and start over in a some other paradise.\r\n\r\nTwice people from the company came back, looking for someone, but apparently not me. I successfully dodged their attentions the first time by hiding inside a dinky comfort room that looked like nobody bothered to maintain it, although it was a close call since one of them also followed me in and I was forced to hide in one of the cubicles. The second time I had to walk right past two women from our company, which I accomplished by pretending to be devouring a newspaper article that conveniently covered my place.\r\n\r\nWith that done, my escape was nearly complete. I slunk around the shadows as dusk started to arrive, and somehow walked into a nice middle-aged lady's house; I asked her where the nearest seven-eleven or ministop was, but she shrugged and apparently there were none in town. Instead I was able to find a small neighborhood drugstore, and began looking around for something to eat, hoping nobody would notice me... \r\n\r\n... and then I woke up. I get the weirdest dreams when I stay up overnight on Saturday and sleep through Sunday afternoon. This one was particularly vivid, though I wish I could have remembered more of the details (and I was fudging some stuff here and there); when I woke up I had the distinct impression that there were much more adventurous undertones in the dream than I recalled. I considered using my awesome dream-recall powers to go back to sleep and continue the dream, but then I realized I was late for Church... \r\n\r",

Those who know me in person might be aware that I'm not really big on out-of-town trips. In short order, the reasons are: being antisocial, tendency to get tired/dizzy on long trips, and not particularly liking seafood.\r\n    /p\r\n    \r\n    p\r\n      I suppose it was okay, although I still had a lot of time being bored out of my wits as expected.

On one hand, Islam dictates that any such depiction of the prophet Mohammed are considered as blasphemy; on the other hand, Western media views it as a free speech issue; since every other religion in the world tolerates media lampooning, why shouldn't Islam? Arguably, other faiths also have a certain threshold of tolerance for religious mockery beyond which they would mercilessly tear down whatever publication dared to print it. The only difference is that the theshold for Islam is a lot easier to break.\r\n\r\nPeople are dying now, from riots against Danish embassies in protest of the actions of the Denmark papers. Western-cultured individuals would question why any intelligent human being would rail against a government for the actions of its' media outlets. But these radicals are the sort that don't understand the virtues of the free press. The sheer number of Muslims reacting violently is a testament as to how many of the freedoms that we in the Western-oriented world take for granted can be considered as unimaginable in some cultures.\r\n\r\nThe frightening thing is that with all the tension between the Western world and Islam right now, these small things are the sort that could be used as an excuse to trigger a third world war. And someone may have even added fuel to the fire on purpose.\r\n\r",

Highlights the world of difference between the American palette and the Filipino one. While they make a good point that Jollibee is the \"crappy burger joint food\" of the Philippines as compared to McDonald's which is the \"crappy burger joint food\" of the US, I don't think I've ever heard any Filipino reference Jollibee food in any such disparaging manner.\r\n\r\nOf course, I like Jollibee too, which is proof that I am a Filipino. :p I don't think I've eaten McDonald's food in more than a year. While there are probably a good number of Americans who hate McDonald's food, Jollibee seems to be universally loved, or at least tolerated, by Filipinos.\r\n\r\nWhether that says something about the Filipino taste buds, the quality of Jollibee food vis-a-vis McDonald's food, or how well the Jollibee marketers understand the patterns of rampant Filipino consumerism is another matter entirely.\r\n\r\nAnyway, to paraphrase the best forum response to their post was this: Jollibee is not for you (Americans), it's for us (Filipinos).\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-style: italic;\"br / (via a href=\"http://tornandfrayed.typepad.com/tornandfrayed/2006/02/jollibeeandth.html\"Torn and Frayed/a)br / /span\r\n\r",

This post will go there.\r\n\r\nThe Blogger profile describes me as a \"Programmer, engineer, scientist, critic, gamer, dreamer, and kid-at-heart.\" Let's break that down, shall we?\r\n\r\nProgrammer : Since January of 2003 I've been working as a software developer for the RP office of a Hong Kong-based company. I'm no Computer Science graduate, but I did manage to fake it well enough to pass the JITSE certification exams. I code because I find that I'm fairly good at it. This is my day job, and I'm luckier than most, because I actually _enjoy _my day job.\r\n\r\nEngineer : I'm an Engineer by education, having completed a degree in Electronics and Communications Engineering from the University. I passed the ECE board exams in 2002, but have never practiced as an Engineer.\r\n\r\nScientist : Does having a Bachelor in Science degree allow me to consider myself a scientist? What about graduating from the premiere science high school in the country? A naturally geeky curiousity that tends to overanalyze everything?\r\n\r\nCritic : No wait, that last one from \"Scientist\" goes here. Maybe I'm only somewhat of a critic. Or maybe what I really meant at the time was that I enjoy criticizing things. 😀\r\n\r\nGamer : Well, just by reading this blog you know I'm into games. Card games, board games, console games, computer games, psychological games, you name it. Regarding electronic gaming, I started with the Atari 5600 that my parents bought in the US, and only during the PS2 era have I started to slow down. At one point or another I have been addicted every major genre: strategy, RPG, action, FPS, puzzle, whatever. Well, except for Dance Dance Revolution and the like. I'm really sucky at that.\r\n\r\nDreamer : I dream of a lot of things, and not only when I sleep. There are a lot of things I want to do, and more things I want to be. Off the top of my head, I want to be a published game developer, a published writer and world-famous. And those are just the three most probable ones :p\r\n\r\nKid-at-heart : I guess you have to be a kid-at-heart to dream the dreams that I do. I really want to expound on this, and the \"Dreamer\" part, but I'm afraid that would entail entirely separate entries. 😀\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.blogger.com/profile/1694272\r\n [2]: http://www.jitse.org/\r",

Lex)\r\n  We want to see all the cool comic-book references and cameos\r\n  We actually like all the drama and though we know otherwise, we harbor some sort of hope that maybe Clark and Lana will still get together anyhow\r\n\r\nAs a comic geek, I guess I'm more inclined toward the first two. And I suspect a large majority of Smallville fans are as well.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I also figure that there are four types of Smallville episodes:\r\n\r\n  Episodes that push the whole Clark-becoming-Superman thing (such as the ones where the ship is opened for the first time, or the one where Clark establishes the Fortress of Solitude.\r\n  Episodes that feature comic-book cameos and references (such as the ones featuring appearances by other DC heroes such as the Flash, Aquaman and Cyborg. I'm still waiting for Bruce Wayne to pop in somewhere)\r\n  Episodes that push Smallville's internal storylines (such as any episode centered on Chloe, Clark/Lana relationship stuff, Lionel's conspiracies, etc.)\r\n  X-Files episodes (most of the \"meteor freak\" episodes)\r\n\r\nNow, obviously, the 3 elements of the first list match nicely with the first 3 elements of the second list. This leads me to believe that most Smallville followers merely tolerate the meteor freak episodes so that they can get to the part where Clark tries to name his dog \"Krypto.\" The first two seasons were chock-full of \"meteor freak\" episodes and I was tempted to give up on the series at that time, but the whole becoming-Superman thing started to get going a bit in the third season, and now in the fifth season it feels like at least 50-75% of the episodes are geared towards eventually reaching the \"Superman\" stage. So, I guess I'm sticking with Smallville for a while, if only to see how what silly excuse they come up with to resolve that whole \"Hey doesn't Superman look like Clark Kent did before he wore glasses?\" thing.",

For those who read this text in the future at a time when all these links are broken, the current President of the Phillipines, Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo has declared a state of national emergency today, claiming that a broad alliance encompassing traditional oppostion groups and the far left and the far right are trying to bring her down. Ironically, she did this on the 20th anniversary of the People Power revolution.\r\n\r\nNow, I can't pretend to be smart enough to realize the legal implications of today's events, nor can I provide some detailed analysis of how we keep doing this sort of thing to ourselves over and over again, nor am I old enough to note any eerie similarities with the events during Marcos' time.\r\n\r\nWhat I do know is that whoever advised the President to proclaim a state of emergency at this stage is either an idiot, or an agent of the political opposition out to take her down. I would like to think that any Philippine President, especially one undergoing questions of her legitimacy, would stay away from anything that would show people that she really was the monster they all claimed she was. A threat of curtailing our democractic freedoms in order to handle a \"coup\" that is not even visible to the people (much less a clear and present danger) can only be construed as an attempt to desperately hold on to power.\r\n\r\nYesterday, I was informed through the usual SMS channels that there might be some sort of trouble during the next couple of days. I shrugged it all off, knowing full well that no matter how many warm bodies the opposition manage to pay off to join their rallies, nothing would happen until they presented a viable alternative to the people, an alternative so blindingly obvious people would have to be idiots not to want it. All GMA had to do was weather the storm, same way she did the whole impeachment fiasco, and she would survive. She just had to avoid \"biting\" at all the forces taunting her, avoid doing anything patently stupid such as declaring martial law.\r\n\r\nWell, it wasn't martial law, but it was still stupid. And just the sort of mistake her opponents have been waiting for. But will they be able to capitalize on it?\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/blog/2006/02/smallville/\r\n [2]: http://www.inq7.net/specialfeatures/emergency/whats/\r\n [3]: http://www.houseonahill.net/index.php/blog/permalink/state-of-national-emergency/1/\r\n [4]: http://www.thepinoy.net/content/index.php/2006/02/24/philippines-tears-itself-apart/\r",

        "content": "---\r\nauthor: Roy\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2006-02-22 06:37:28\r\ntitle: Taxi Tales -- The Badass Vigilante One\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2006/02/taxi-tales-the-badass-vigilante-one/\r\n---\r\n\r\n... or so he claimed.\r\n\r\nThe conversation started off easily enough, he said the MMDA over at Megamall were staring him down for daring to wait for me to run up to his cab. For some reason, he soon digressed into how earlier that day he had witnessed a man snatch a cellphone from a young woman inside a jeepney. The young woman was of course dumbstruck as the perp made his escape. My host candidly told me that if only he'd had a passenger to watch his cab for him, he would have stepped out of his cab (he was deep in traffic) and given chase himself.\r\n\r\nAs if to make sure that I believed he would be capable of such a thing, he related how he had once survived a hold-up attempt by three young men, killing one of them in the process. He described the encounter as one that left him wounded and bloody all over.\r\n\r\nHe also displayed quite a disdain for drug addicts, as he recounted the time some guy asked to be brought to the pier while carrying a bag of _shabu _in the early morning. Our heroic (?) taxi driver made it a point to choose a route that brought him past a police checkpoint, and he used his headlights to signal to the cops that there was something fishy, so they were flagged down for checking. He told the cops that he didn't care about the taxi fare, just wants to be rid of the guy.\r\n\r\nThen there was the time a snatcher was running past his cab, and he opened the driver-side door to smash into the guy. Once the perpetrator was on the ground, he proceeded to kick him down and even broke his wrist. (He gave me a small demo by flopping around his hand.) He said he then left the guy to the barangay tanods, as a gift.\r\n  \r\n_\r\n  \r\n\"Regalo ko na sa inyo yan,\" _were his words, he said.\r\n\r\nThen we went into the inevitable litany of how soft we were on crime. Apparently he had worked in Saudi for more than 10 years, and he preferred the Saudi method of eye for an eye; when a thief was caught in Suadi Arabia, his hands were cut off. He pshawed away any talk of human rights, saying that if a person was guilty he should just be killed right away. He professed a hatred of criminals and drug addicts and implied that he enjoys any chance to deliver some beatdown on them.\r\n\r\nI, of course, was tempted to play devil's advocate and argue for the side of human rights, but I realized that this was a guy who had confessed to killing someone before! Granted, I'm not robbing him, but I might get at least a poke in the eye for disagreeing with him!\r\n\r\nNow me, I've never witnessed a single snatching or holding-upping or anything like that on the mean streets of metro manila. This man was giving me insights on how it was to truly live on the streets. And I found myself thinking, at least at that level there are still people who reject the rampant criminality that apparently pervades our streets (however ends-justify-the-means his reasoning may be).\r\n\r\nThe taxi driver remarked that robbers and snatchers always say something like \"I just needed money to buy milk for my baby\", which is a totally BS excuse. Many hundreds, if not thousands of our countrymen struggle everyday trying to make a decent, honest living, and as long as there are people able to walk that road, \"I had to do it to survive\" is \\not\\ an excuse.\r\n\r\nThat sort of petty crime on the streets is a vicious cycle, and even if you say that it's caused by poverty, it also causes poverty by itself... more often than not the victims are just the sort of people who have worked extra hard to be able to save up for something decent. As the taxi driver mentioned, many of the snatched cellphones are probably not even yet fully paid for. It's a case of poverty feeding upon itself.\r\n\r\nWe wandered into more discussions about gun control, the situation in America and Saudi Arabia and almost always his solutions came back to some form of harsh and inhumane punishment or perhaps vigilantism. Maybe it's not a bad idea; imagine how much safer Metro Manila might be if we had some sort of Batman-like character prowling the night and scaring the hell out of would-be criminals?",

The last time was a long time ago, and although I wanted to see it, there was no way I could convince my parents then that the largish amount of cash needed to go was worth it. This time, I was determined to go, and I bought tickets for my brother Alvin and our _pamangkin _Gelo (so I spent for three tickets total.) We only got Upper Box B tickets at the Araneta Colliseum, but that was enough. Some people were telling me it was a waste of money to see the show, but after the experience of last night, I have to say it was really worth it! In fact, I can only imagine that the \"main\" Monday Night RAW shows are probably even better.\r\n\r\nI'm not going to discuss the ins and outs of Wrestling here, I've had my share of getting people to understand why I follow it. (Of course it's scripted! So are 80% of other TV shows!) But the most important thing to understand is that it's a show. Not only that, it's a hell of a show.\r\n\r\nThey really know how to hold a live-audience show, everything they do is designed to pull in the crowd, get them to participate. They encourage the chanting, and they ad lib some of the responses to roll with how the crowd is going. It's all about the crowd, the Wrestler's job is to control the crowd, and every Wrestler plays his role well. And watching it live is a lot better than watching it on TV, because you're there, and you're part of the show, and you pay attention even to the matches that would've been boring on TV. You even respond and boo Tyson Tomko and Gene Snitsky, even if odds are you wouldn't care about them if you were watching it on TV. And you appreciate every single performance. Even the heels are clapped for on their way out; I'm not sure if it's the same with the US-side RAW episodes since the loser departures are almost never shown on-air.\r\n\r\nThe matches held were:\r\n\r\nEugene vs Snitsky -- huge pop for Eugene, the crowd is really into him, especially the teenage girls (I'm not sure why I saw so many teenage girls in the crowd, I have no idea what Wrestling's true demographic is). Eugene had a toy stuffed bear with him and the crowd tore Snitsky apart with boos when he destroyed the thing. Eugene wins via Rock Bottom! Funniest bit: Someone in the crowd tried to pull off a ghost fighter reference by trying to start a \"Tapusin na yan!\" chant, too bad the crowd didn't follow.\r\n\r\nTorie and Lita vs. Trish and Maria with Val Venis as special guest referee -- huge pop for each one of the divas. We all know these are beautiful women, but too bad we were too far up to really appreciate it. I will say that from where I was seated Trish Stratus' cleavage was more visible than her face. :p Now, diva matches aren't usually the most entertaining wrestling-wise, as the crowd is usually into it because they like to see beautiful women jumping at each other. After a few exchanges, the crowd got a little antsy and started the \"We want puppies!\" chant. (One of my companions was a 12-year old. I think he thought the puppies referred to Torie Wilson's pet dog.) Anyway, Torie and Lita win via some form of cheating. Funniest bit: There was this sequence where three of the divas were rolling over each other and knocked down Val Venis and started rolling over him. Val Venis got up smiling.\r\n\r\nRob Van Dam vs Tyson Tomko -- the crowd was really into RVD, and Tyson Tomko got a lot of heat. People were a bit bored with the grappling parts, everyone expecting RVD to get in some high-flying kicks. An \"ECW\" chant kept going for a while. RVD hit with the spinning heel kick, then followed-up with the Rolling Thunder (awesome to see live!), and finished with the Five-Star Frog Splash (he had to turn a bit in mid-air &#8216;coz Tomko was at a somewhat wrong angle) Funniest bit: After chanting \"RVD!\" a while, the crowd eventually changed the chant to \"DVD!\"\r\n\r\nMick Foley vs Carlito -- Carlito got a huge pop during his entrance, and started off on the mic saying \"This place is great!\" (huge pop) then followed up with \"Just kidding!\", then he proceeds to his heel routine, eventually making fun of local women by comparing them to Manny Pacquiao. Whoa, that was a LOT of heat right there. Mick Foley music interrupted his speech and the Hardcore Legend came in and the crowd went nuts, getting on their feet and cheering as Mick Foley walked around the ring. Mick Foley gets the cheap pop (\"It's great to be here in Manila, Philippines!\"), and they go at it. Carlito grapples with Foley for a while, and some hair-pulling goes on. Carlito keeps chickening out, but Mick Foley finally grabs him as he's trying to head up the exit ramp. Foley pulls him back into the ring and does the Cactus Jack routine, hitting with the double-arm DDT. He looks around at the crowd and pulls out the sock and the crowd goes wild again! Carlito grabs an apple to chew on, but he turns around spits out apple chunks as the Mandible Claw and Mr. Socko knock him down to the canvas! Mick Foley wins! Funniest bit: Middle of the match, Carlito keeps trying to escape, and Foley eventually does the clucking-chicken gesture, and the crowd starts chanting \"Chicken!\" at Carlito (in that unique Filipino pronunciation of the word), eventually prompting Carlito to get a mic and exclaim \"Carlito is not a chicken!\" Foley says something to the announcer and it is announced, \"Ladies and Gentlemen, it has been confirmed that Carlito is indeed a chicken!\"\r\n\r\nIntercontinental -- Shelton Benjamin vs Viscera. Shelton gets the inevitable \"Mama' boy\" chants, and Vis gets the huge pops. Shelton whines about we're all just jealous of his momma, and Viscera is huge. Shelton does some stuff, but finished without a T-bone Suplex. Funniest bit: That I didn't have to explain to a 12-year old boy what Viscera was doing to Shelton with that move.\r\n\r\nChris Masters and HHH vs Big Show and Ric Flair -- Masters' entrance got some pops, but not very impressive without the pyros. Triple H's music hits and the crowd is on their feet, hands in the air! They're all cheering for the most dastardly man in the business today! HHH is the next champion! Big Show and Ric Flair come in next, and the cheers for them are roughly as loud as was for the Game. Anyway, they get it on. Lockups, the usual tag team stuff, ganging up, Big Show doing gorilla presses on everybody, etc. The crowd is really into Flair, every move he makes gets a \"Wooo!\" from the crowd. Alvin and I want to see the Pedigree, and finally, HHH manages to grab Flair and go for it! But Show interrupts, and chokeslams the game, then Flair locks the figure four onto Masters and it's over! (Boo, we wanted to see the Pedigree!)\r\n\r\nBig Show stops Flair from leaving the ring, and they have a surprise for him! Trish and Maria come out carrying a cake, along with RVD, Eugene and Viscera. It's Ric Flair and Maria's birthday! Triple H comes out and breaks kayfabe, shaking Flair's hand before walking out.\r\n\r\nWWE championship -- John Cena vs Edge. Main event time! The Steel cage is lowered to the ring; it's a lot lower than it looks on TV, especially from where we were sitting. Edge comes in to some cheers (and jeers), but the next entrance is guaranteed to get the crowd on its' feet. John Cena's music hits and the crowd goes ABSOLUTELY INSANE! The champ is here, and there's lotsa chain gang members in the Philippines! Apparently a lot of them were little kids too! Cena and Edge start slamming each other into the cage, Edge tries to get out a couple of times, but Cena is just fast enough to catch him. Edge is knocked down, and the crowd spells it out: \"You can't see me!\" The five-knuckle shuffle only gets a two count, and more action ensues. Eventually, the ref gets knocked out. Lita low-blows the ref on the outside as Cena tries to get out the door, then slams the door in Cena's face. Edge hits the spear and the two of them gang up on Cena. Lita gets on the ropes as Edge holds up Cena, setting up for the hurricanrana, but Cena ducks out of the way and Lita's mighty legs toss Edge into the cage! Cena capitalizes, hitting the FU on Lita, then on Edge, then makes the pin for the win! Cena climbs to the top of the cage and holds the championship belt up high and the crowd goes wild! Funniest bit: That the crowd still erupts in cheers when Cena manages to get out of a two-count, despite knowing that there's no way the title would change hands that night.\r\n\r\nAgain, awesome, awesome show. Although Araneta Colliseum, specifically the inside part leading to the Upper Box entrances, was cramped! Helluva lot of people, they probably oversold, seeing as how people filled every nook and cranny of Upper Box B despite supposedly being guaranteed seating. I would post pics, but we were so far, most of our pics were crappy! Terrific experience, I'm glad we went to see the show. 😀",

Unfortunately, the default included players (Kaffeine and Amarok) were giving me trouble, claiming they could not play mp3s! I asked around for some help, and read some FAQs, but I kept getting errors trying to download and install gstreamer-mad 0.8.\r\n\r\nAfter a while I gave up and started mucking around in Adept to find an alternative program. I finally settled on installing Beep Mp3 Player, which proceeded to play my mp3 files 😀 Yay! I can install stuff! BMP is a bit like Winamp2, so at least I'm familiar with it. I wonder if there are global hotkeys for it?\r\n\r\nAlso, now that I was a bit more familiar with Adept, I used it to install Firefox. But the repository only had Firefox 1.0.7! Wazzup with that?\r\n\r\nFor next time:\r\n\r\n-- install Firefox 1.5.x\r\n\r\n-- get my screen resolution above 1028&#215;768 (Edit, 20 mins. later: I couldn't sleep, so I went ahead and did this. I will probably be late tomorrow. I feel extra geeky now =/)\r\n\r\n-- find more stuff to do\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Clair on 2006-03-14 09:32:56 +0000\r\nI am more of a GNOME person 😛\r\n\r\nYeah, you need some plugins.\r\n\r\nXMMS is the closest thing you could get to Winamp, btw. You could even use the\r\n  \r\nold skins of WinAmp (Classic skins is the name...  If they have .wsz at the\r\n  \r\nname, rename it to .zip and it would work 😉 Real neat huh?)\r\n\r\nBeep and XMMS have no problems playing mp3s out of the box.\r\n\r\nI don't really use the GUIfied stuff to play media. mplayer is still the way\r\n  \r\nto go, as far as I am concerned, or EMMS in Emacs 😉 (Which calls other\r\n  \r\ncommand line tools like mplayer, mpg321, ogg123)\r\n\r\na href=\"http://amarok.kde.org/amarokwiki/index.php/MP3onUbuntu5.10\" rel=\"nofollow\"http://amarok.kde.org/amarokwiki/index.php/MP3onUbuntu5.10/a\r\n\r\nIs that the one you checked? Hmm. What errors have you been getting? You could\r\n  \r\nalways log on to #ubuntu or #ubuntu-ph using GAIM or X-chat and ask for help\r\n  \r\n😉\r\n\r\nIt's weird that FF1.5 isn't in the universe :(\r\n\r\nUpdate your Ubuntu ok?

I tried it when Mandrake 10.1 OR came out. Astig! May\r\n  \r\nlive cd pa nga na basically Amarok talaga yung ffeature 😉 Check it out on\r\n  \r\ndistrowatch 😀\r\n\r\nAs for desktop environments. you could opt for which one everytime you login.\r\n  \r\nEverything is just a sudo apt-get install away.

Why do people keep paying you for something they could get free?\r\n \r\n Ballmer: One, people value their time. Our stuff does more, and they like that. Two, people value their time, and those [free] things tend to be clunky. Let's say you think you can save $50. And then you go and waste three hours. You tell me how quick that payback is. Y\r\n\r\nAwesome example, especially from a third-world POV. Let's try a practical example: Microsoft Office.\r\n\r\nOkay, after being tossed around in a haphazard manner by the Microsoft Office website, I've determined that the box price of Microsoft Office 2003 Standard Edition is around $400.\r\n\r\nLet's say we have a guy in the US who wants to buy an Office suite. A typical middle-class white-collar guy, who needs it to write stalker-type fan-mail, balance his budget, whatever. This typical middle-class guy (let's call him Joe) makes about $200 a day. (Okay, that might be on the low-end for US salaries, I don't really know; but bear with me here, I don't want have to do any more actual research... ). So he compares the cost of MS Office 2003 Standard Edition, which he uses at work (yes, this unscientific thought experiment considers MS lock-in!), with that of this alternative thingy he heard of, OpenOffice. Why, the difference is a whopping $400! That's four days work!\r\n\r\nNow, Joe reasons: If I go for OpenOffice, I save two days' salary's worth in buying price... but I have to download it, familiarize myself with it, convert all my old documents... and I don't even know if it will do everything I want! MS Office is convenient, and for Joe, it's just two days' salary anyway. It might very well be worth it for Joe to just buy MS Office and not have to bother with all this open source business.\r\n\r\nNow, say we have another user, this time from the Philippines: Juan is a typical Filipino office worker. He's earning around P500 a day. (Okay, I'm sure this here is a fairly good number) He looks at the price of MS Office and... why, the price is a whopping $400! That's P20,000! That translates to about a 1.33 month's worth of Juan's salary! Juan finds out there's a free alternative: OpenOffice. He's not familiar with it, but Juan is a pretty smart guy, and he figures in a month or so, he can be just as good with OpenOffice as with MS Office. After all, it didn't take him one month to figure out MS Office right?\r\n\r\nThis points us to the awesome conclusion: Open source becomes more attractive as people earn less. What an interesting (non-scientific) thought experiment! Even more interesting, if we remove the MS lock-in factor, Joe has even less incentive to buy MS Office... since he has to familiarize himself with whatever software he gets anyway. So, what does this mean for Microsoft? It means, the best way for traditional software companies to conquer developing markets is to increase the per capita income in those countries! Microsoft should make us richer!\r\n\r\nThink about that: more than a month of Juan's hard-earned salary is needed to buy this software! No wonder the software pirates are so rampant in developing countries!\r\n\r",

Not that we mind, after all, local bets actually did kick ass and shrugged off the Japanese invasion.\r\n/p\r\n\r\nIf you are in fact a Filipino Magic player, then I hope you know what I'm talking about -- last weekend at the Robinson's Galleria Trade Hall, almost four hundred local and foreign Magic: The Gathering players gathered for the third-ever Grand Prix event held in Manila.\r\n\r\nI was there, of course, since for some reason I enjoy this expensive game. Sadly, the usual bunch of people who I've played Magic with since college were not available to ride with me into battle; my companions that day were some people from work instead.\r\n\r\nIt was my first-ever GP, and it was an awesome experience, to say the least. Compared to the usual local events I've attended before, the atmosphere is much more formal; it really feels like you're playing on a completely different level of Magic. I also played in a GPT the day before, which turned out to be a good idea as I suddenly got nervous playing against the Japanese guy who took me down in the second-round of the single-elimination trial. A good thing, because I was better prepared mentally the next day.\r\n\r\nI blazed through the first five rounds with a 4-1 record, my sealed deck an all-attacking, no-thinking affair, battles mostly won on the back of a&nbsp;aSilhanna Ledgewalker&nbsp;/abearing a&nbsp;aMoldervine Cloak&nbsp;/aor a&nbsp;aShadow Lance/a. My one loss was against an officemate who got me on bad draws...  After he won our match 2-1, I proceeded to win every other practice game against him :(\r\n\r\nRegardless, I was feeling pretty confident, even though my sealed deck had not been very exciting -- not many bombs -- it was doing fairly well, and I was winning matches fairly quickly, each best-of-three affair over in less than twenty minutes. I wanted that sort of deck, the type that wins fast, as I knew from history that long, drawn-out matches gave me a headache. I felt pretty good going into the 6th round, knowing that a win and a draw in the next two rounds meant I was sure to qualify for the second day. I hadn't fought any foreign pros yet, but with my win record I was fairly sure I was heading into that territory... \r\n\r\nSo I went to check the 6th round pairings, and sure enough my next opponent was 2005 Invitational Winner&nbsp;Terry Soh. Whoo! I had been hoping I would get a chance to take on either Terry Soh or world champion Hori, both of whom were participating; what an upset it would have been for a local amateur with a sub-1600 rating to take down one of these guys!\r\n\r\nWell, long story short, I didn't win. :p He took the first game after some trading of blows; I gave him a beating in the second game via&nbsp;aSkeletal Vampire&nbsp;/aand won unopposed. Third game, we were trading blows again, but he had a&nbsp;aHammerfist Giant&nbsp;/athat cleared the board, and I didn't have any creatures to followup. He won shortly after. So much for that!\r\n\r\n7th round. I needed to win this one to have a shot at the second day (not even a very good shot at that... I think only 20% of 5-2's would have advanced, but my tie-break points were pretty good since 3 of my 4 wins were 2-0... ). I took game 1 fast, lost game 2 to a sudden surge of fatties, then lost game 3 with my opponent&nbsp;at one life! Sigh... \r\n\r\nIt's just as well that I didn't make it to the second day though... I thought I was just getting a headache from playing Magic all day, but I found out later I was already coming down with a fever and some colds. Even if I did make it to day 2, I would have just rare-drafted. :p\r\n\r\nWell, that's my small part of the GP Manila story. Eventually, local amateur JT Porter won the grand prize, netting almost four thousand US dollars. Sigh... that coulda been me :p I hope the guys at Neutral Grounds can manage to arrange another big event like this in the Philippines soon... while we aren't the biggest Magic community in the world, we got a whole lotta heart. ^_^\r\n\r",

I picked up a lot of good ideas, hopefully I can start to make some interesting changes in the place I work at.\r\n\r\n_\r\n  \r\nPragmatic Programmer: From Journeyman to Master\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n  \r\nby Andrew Hunt and David Thomas -- yeah, I've been in a sort of \"improving my software development skills\" mode lately, snapping up books like this and the previous one and going through them like life depended on it. Lots of sagely advice here, mostly stuff good developers know about inherently, and quite a few good ideas new to me.\r\n\r\n_\r\n  \r\nAng Alamat ng Gubat\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n  \r\nby Bob Ong -- literally translated, it's \"The Forest Legend\"; the book is somewhat of a modern-day fable about how things are in the modern-day Philippines. I'm pretty sure each of the animals in the book represents some sector of society and its' faults, but I don't think I'm currently smart enough to identify them all.\r\n\r\n_\r\n  \r\nStainless Longganisa\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n  \r\nby Bob Ong -- I picked up this and the previous book on a whim at National Bookstore, because we were sorely in need of new bathroom reading material. (I'm not kidding, and bathroom reading material should be a treasured position among authors.) As usual, Bob Ong starts off with some hilarious real-life tales, before heading into some serious stuff about life in the Philippines. The main thrust of this book is to explain how and why he became a writer, giving the reader some insights into what aspiring writers in the Philippines can look forward to (or avoid.)\r\n\r\n_\r\n  \r\nEqual Rites\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n  \r\nby Terry Pratchett -- I think this is the third Discworld book, but it's only the first one I finished. I'm not sure, it seems like the Discworld books make relatively quick and painless reading. It's light fantasy of course, much the same way that Douglas Adams is light sci-fi; not the sort of thing you should seriously form a whole range of theories about, but fascinating nonetheless. I believe I will try to read more of these books.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Clair on 2006-03-14 09:34:59 +0000\r\nI love Stainless Longganisa! I got inspired to write about my dream to get\r\n  \r\npublished. Hahaha. a href=\"http://clair.pinoyweb.net/?p=551\" rel=\"nofollow\"http://clair.pinoyweb.net/?p=551/a\r\n\r\nI still have to return Switch's The Fifth Elephant (T Pratchett). It's good!\r\n  \r\n😀",

If so, I suppose I have more than ten years' worth of piracy-related sins to confess.\r\n\r\nYeah, I go to confession. Once a year, around the Holy Week period usually. Once a year is the minimum frequency required by the Catholic Church, but I wonder how many observe it?\r\n\r\nMany parishes in busy Metro Manila hold a \"Kumpisalang Bayan\" (er... I'd say \"Mass Confessional\", Mass as in lots of people, would be a reasonable translation) around the Holy Week period, where several priests receive confessions from any and all comers. Problem is that there's always a queue for each priest. Here's a tip: Choose the queue with the least number of old people, especially old women. Old women seem to take the longest time for some reason.\r\n\r\nIf I were writing a webcomic, one of the characters would go to confession, and the priest would give him an unreasonable penance, something like \"Recite the Our Father ten thousand times\", and the guy would go like\r\n\r\n % for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) { %\r\n  \r\n Our Father who art in heaven... \"\r\n  \r\n % } %\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

But BG2 holds up pretty well, I end having a mental coin toss as to which game I will play at any one time. They both have their merits.\r\n\r\nSuiko5\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nPros: Awesome story, lots of background and character depth.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nCons: Extremely narrow gameplay, heavily scripted. Hero looks girly.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nStatus: 12 hours in. Kicked out of home town? Check. Branded a rebel and thrust into leadership of one side of a civil war? Check. True Rune attaching itself to your hero? Check. Only thing we need now is a permanent HQ. I can't imagine living on a boat would be very enticing for me in real life. On a side note, this is the first Suikoden where I'm actively using an FAQ to avoid missing Stars of Destiny. It was ok not to use an FAQ before, as I always had time to make a second pass to complete the 108 stars after the first play-through. But again, I'm a busy man. (On a side note to this side note, the closest I came to completing the 108 stars without using an FAQ was Suiko4 -- I got 107!)\r\n\r\nBG2:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nPros: Wide, open-ended gameplay options. Can build any type of character or party to suit your playing style.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nCons: Moderately-old-school graphics. Beholders and mind flayers are annoying.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nStatus: 40+ days of game time in, still in chapter 2. Gee, won't Imoen be worried that I've left her in captivity for more than a month now? As mentioned, beholders and mind flayers are a pain, but Yoshino's traps and summoned skellies help a lot. On a side note, I always play a female pally in D&D; games. This one is no different, except that I made the mistake of choosing the Cavalier kit which prevents me from using ranged weapons.\r\n\r\nAs always, the strength of console RPGs lies in their story focus. Console RPGs can be likened to traditional well-written books, whereas PC RPGs are more like Choose Your Own Adventures.",

He refused to let me in because I was wearing slippers! Since we dress casually on Saturdays, very so often I like to wear slippers to work, especially when I'm feeling too lazy to put on socks. They never gave me any trouble before, so I argued with the guard for a bit. Stubborn-headed, he still wouldn't let me in. I stalked off grumbling and got into a taxi home. (I came back later... that guard cost me like an hour and a half of my time and about three hundred pesos in taxi fare... )\r\n\r\nOn hindsight, I let my being pissed off cloud my better judgement. What I should have done was:\r\n\r\n-- first, ask for a copy of the building circular or memorandum stating the dress code\r\n\r\n-- second, ask to see his supervisor and ask why just last week I was allowed to wear slippers, but not this week\r\n\r\n-- third, if all else failed, try to get in through the basement entrance\r\n\r\n-- only after all of the above fail should I have gone home for shoes\r\n\r\nI think I need to be more cunning.",

Terrorism, oil scarcity, trade imbalances and worldwide poverty come to mind, and these are the ones most commonly discussed in mainstream media. There is however, another important battle being waged that is far removed from the minds of the everyday person. That battle is Recording Industry vs The People.\r\n\r\nSome of the posts at the above blog are awesome reads and point to an alarming pattern of abuse of the United States' judicial system by large corporations with armies of lawyers at their disposal waging a war against ordinary American citizens. The scary part is that the agenda the RIAA is pushing with its' strong-arm tactics seems to point towards a conclusion that because sharing of copyrighted material is detrimental to their business model, _all _file-sharing should be considered as criminal activity.\r\n\r\nAt a time that the world is supposedly entering an Age of Information, the outcome of this battle threatens to pull the upcoming age in one of two directions: On one side, a world where large companies monopolize the creation and delivery of content to the addicted consumer masses. On the other side, a world where people can choose to share their own creations freely and without fear of being branded as communists, a world where people have the choice to patronize freely-shared creations or those offered for a fee.\r\n\r\nWhile these are concerns under American law only, the very nature of the distribution system being challenged -- the internet -- makes this a global issue as well. Though \"the internet\" is still only a vague concept in the minds of the majority of the world's citizens, the day will eventually come when almost everybody is online. The question is, when that day comes, would you want to live in the world the RIAA is building?\r\n\r",

This was a good idea during those days that I had a lot of free time and could finish the average RPG in a week. I haven't been in that state for four years.)\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n\r\nMy brother warned me that according to reviews, the first eight hours or so of Suikoden V were quite draggy. When I thought about it, that should be expected. I've played Suikoden 1-4 of course, and in all those games, a largish part of the beginning involved the setup where your young hero (or heroes as in Suikoden 3) would be thrust in the middle of a conflict that would eventually result in a quest to gather 108 Stars of Destiny.\r\n\r\nI'm about 5 hours into Suikoden V, and I have to say: It's draggier than usual. I think it's because most of the first five hours are heavily scripted, mostly scenes with minor interactions designed to lay out all the backstory and history and political intrigue and whatnot. It's been five hours, and I still have no idea what the main conflict is gonna be... granted it looks like there's gonna be some civil unrest at some point, but we have no idea yet who's going to be on which side, etc. In Suikoden I, I'm pretty sure you were appointed the head of the Liberation Army long before the five-hour point! In Suikoden II, you were kicked out of your homes within two hours. In Suikoden V, it feels like five hours and four weeks of game time later, you're still running errands to ensure your sister's engagement to a scheming noble goes through. Hopefully it starts to pick up soon.\r\n\r\nOne of the things I noticed this time around: I don't like that thing in console RPGs where you have to wander around town until you run into the exact area where a scene will move the story forward. It was fine in Dragon Quest VIII (the last console RPG I played), but here it's ridiculous... mostly because the cities here seem huge! Granted, I've only seen Sol-Falena and Stormfist, but both of those cities were large, multi-area maps. There were some sequences where you literally had to systematically traverse the whole town to find the next scene that triggers the story. Maybe I'm just spoiled because I've been playing Baldur's Gate 2 lately. That game has a huge city too, but you couldn't walk half a screen through the city without some quest or event thrown at you.\r\n\r\nAnyway, yeah. They need to get to the \"Okay, I got an HQ and I'm gonna collect 108 stars\" point faster, that's where all the gameplay is anyway. I think the start of the game suffers from the fact there's a lot of back story to cover: the discord between factions in the Senate, the struggle for the throne two generations prior, the invasion from Armes eight years ago, the wrath of Arshtat two years ago, how a barbarian managed to win the Sacred Games and thus marry into the royal family, etc. I suppose that all this back story is needed \\before\\ the meat of the game gets underway, otherwise they could have just sprinkled it in liberally through the game...",

I swear, games are the only thing keeping Linux from becoming mainstream; The whole shebang about Linux being hard to use for ordinary folk really isn't much when you consider that a lot of ordinary folk ask for help even when using Windows anyway. The default installation of distros like Ubuntu might very well be enough for \"ordinary folk\"... \r\n\r\nBut for gamers like me, (even though I'm not \\that\\ hardcore a gamer anymore), unless we're willing to satisfy ourselves with a windows emulation layer, we'll still need Windows... \r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

Well, sluggish compared to gmail at least. The biggest problem is that scrollbar in the message list. It's like promising that you can scroll through all your messages, but when you try to scroll to a far away part of the list, you just get a lot of \"Loading... \" text. I doubt that scales very well, especially as you get to the thousands in your number of messages.\r\n\r\nGoogle is being smart in that Gmail will only display at most 100 messages at a time.

My mom works there and she earned a free night's stay; so we took advantage of her employee discount as well. Not really very exciting for me, as there's seldom much to do in a hotel except to enjoy the air-conditioned room and watch TV. It was a bit interesting to stroll down the baywalk that night, but I'm not much of a nightlife person so I tired of it eventually. The highlight of our stay at Diamond is almost always the breakfast buffet. This instance was no exception.\r\n\r\nThat is all.\r\n\r\nPS. Bathtubs are hard to use.",

But then again, this is a nation of Catholics who tend to elect action stars to high office because of all the goody-goody roles they portray in the movies, so maybe the priests have some sort of point.\r\n\r\nThe best view of this affair has to be from the street vendors who plan to hawk the pirated copies of the movie: If the movie is banned, all the people who would have watched the movie would be buying from them instead! Good times!\r\n\r\nAs for me, I'm not much into going to the theatre nowadays. I'll probably watch it someday, probably in the comfort of home.

Some people might say, \"of course it's fair to expect as much from other people as yourself!\", but the fact is that I'm not even sure if I expect too much from myself. I may like to project and arrogant and prideful exterior, but I'm extremely self-critical. I feel that many of the problems in our current project have been caused directly by my own lack of experience in handling techincal design decisions. However, my own perceptions contrast with the assessments I get from my peers. I'm neither kidding nor trying to brag here... I've actually had assessment sessions where the phrases \"idolize\" and \"would like to follow his career path\" were used. I'm not sure if I'm being buttered up or my expectations of myself are really that far out of sync with the world... \r\n\r\nAnyway, meaningless self-analysis aside, what makes a good software developer? I'm sure many others have given numerous things to look for in developers, but for now I think there's one trait I can identify: a passion for learning. I prefer software developers who are always looking to improve themselves; the ones who buy reference books, read articles on the &#8216;net, consult with senior developers for design advice, attend trainings and seminars, etc. They study what works and what does not in software development, and they strive to apply only the best practices. For lack of a better term, such people are craftsmen, software development is their craft. I'm fairly sure that any software developer who exhibits such qualities is a pretty good one.\r\n\r\nI suppose I'm fairly lucky. Of the current crop of developers I work with, at least 3 out of 10 satisfy that description. Not a bad ratio.",

So, I'm all \"alpha geek\" and stuff, and I go: \"No we can't. We can't style the &#8216;Browse' button directly, and IE will throw an Access Denied error on submit if we invoke the click() method using Javascript.\"\r\n\r\nBut HK guy replies: \"Gee, I wonder how GMail does it then.\"\r\n\r\nI checked, and he's right. I never noticed before because I use Firefox all the time, but GMail in IE doesn't even show the freakin' file input control! It's just an \"Attach a File\" link that opens the \"Open File\" dialog on click! I took a look at it and I was like... \"how in the world... \"\r\n\r\nSo, being a developer, I of course attempt to get the source, analyze it, break it down, and get it to work for me. But from experience, I know that trying to figure out gmail's obfuscated javascript code would take me days. So I decided to take an alternative approach: I would let gmail execute it's weird javascript magic, then use javascript myself to extract the relevant HTML and Javascript code from the gmail window at the correct state.\r\n\r\nMy first attempt: I tried to load gmail in an iframe so I could read the document contents from window.top. Eh, no go. Gmail pops itself out of the frame easily.\r\n\r\nMy second attempt: I open gmail in a new window using javascript's window.open, then use the resulting window variable to access the document contents. Something like this:\r\n\r\n html\r\n  \r\n body\r\n  \r\n script\r\n  \r\n var win;\r\n  \r\n function doIt() {\r\n\t  \r\n win = window.open(&#8216;http://www.gmail.com');\r\n  \r\n }\r\n  \r\n function getIt() {\r\n\t  \r\n document.getElementById(\"t\").innerHTML = win.document.body.innerHTML;\r\n  \r\n }\r\n  \r\n /script\r\n  \r\n br/input type=\"button\" onclick=\"doIt()\" value=\"clickMe\" /\r\n  \r\n br/input type=\"button\" onclick=\"getIt()\" value=\"getContents\" /\r\n  \r\n br/textarea style=\"width:100%; height: 40%;\" id=\"t\"/textarea\r\n  \r\n /body\r\n  \r\n /html \r\n\r\nWow, \"Access is denied.\" Who knew IE actually had that much security?\r\n\r\nI try a few other methods, mainly trying to navigate the properties of the \"win\" variable to find something I can actually use. I go through trees of frames trying to find something... but I get \"Access Denied\" and \"Permission Denied\" anytime I try to get near a document element.\r\n\r\nDamn this is tough... I thought it would only take me a few minutes =/\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by advanced on 2007-10-31 17:12:52 +0000\r\nBetter late than never?\r\n\r\nYou bumped into IE's \"Same Origin Policy\" security protocol.\r\n\r\nIf you use .hta (Microsoft's HTML Application extension) you can bypass it.\r\n\r\nYou'll need to crawl the microsoft dev center a bit to find out how to\r\n  \r\nproperly initialize an .hta in a chromeless IE browser window.. but it's worth\r\n  \r\nthe effort for future reference.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you can use firefox tamper data plugin or a greasemonkey hack to\r\n  \r\nbypass firefox's SOP, but I don't think that's what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nAs a side note you can use prototype event handlers to stop the framebuster\r\n  \r\n\"beforeunload\" but gmail still won't load in a frame for some reason or\r\n  \r\nanother (both the original and the new interface update exhibit this\r\n  \r\nbehaviour, I don't know if it's intentional or just lucky).\r\n\r\nAnyways.. they use javascript browser detection and it's not really obfuscated\r\n  \r\nin the newest version, just stop the page load on the \"Loading... \" screen and\r\n  \r\nview source.\r\n\r\nPersonally I'd use PHP to snoop the browser type in the header\r\n  \r\n$\\SERVER[\"HTTP\\USER_AGENT\"] and then use an if statement to server the correct\r\n  \r\nHTML.\r\n\r\nAlternatively you could check if the user agent will accept xml applications\r\n  \r\nsince mozilla and opera will but IE still doesn't load them as true\r\n  \r\napplications:\r\n\r\nif ( stristr($\\SERVER[\"HTTP\\ACCEPT\"],\"application/xhtml+xml\")\r\n\r\nBETTER still.. (K.I.S.S.) theme an input button using CSS and IE ONLY switches\r\n  \r\nand skip all the guess work and iffy browser detection routines.\r\n\r\nSeeing as it's been well over a year since you posted this I hope you got it\r\n  \r\nsorted ..)",

There's a lot of politics involved in this game, and most of the first eight hours are a bit draggy because they spend so much time elaborating on it.\r\n\r\nAs for gameplay, the trademark Suikoden mechanic comes back again: gathering the 108 stars of destiny to your cause. This has always been the shining point of Suikoden -- the 108 stars quest makes it stand above all other console RPGs where combat is basically the only thing standing between you and the ending. Simply winning all the battles will get you to an ending, but not\r\n   \r\n_\r\n    \r\nthe\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n   \r\nending. To get the canonical ending, Suikoden gives you an additional challenge -- one that is exploratory in nature. Finding (and recruiting) the 108 stars is an incredible challenge, and I &#8216;m fairly sure that only the most patient of gamers can successfully do it on the first play-through without a walkthrough. Suikoden V feels a bit more difficult than previous games with this regard, as many of the 108 stars of destiny have to be recruited at certain times within a very narrow window only. The closest I've ever come was with Suikoden IV -- I actually got to 107 (!) before missing out on Snowy :/ For Suikoden V, finally surrendering to the fact that I don't have that much time for gaming anymore, I went ahead and used an FAQ to help in the 108 stars, knowing I would not have time for a second play-through.\r\n\r\nAs for other gameplay mechanics, they're mostly inherited from earlier games in the series, but enhanced to give you more flexibility. I especially like the fact that you can now bring up to 10 characters around with you -- 6 for battle and 4 in the entourage. Any battle-ready characters in the entourage can be swapped in during battle, costing you only a turn and allowing for some interesting tactical decisions. Noncombat characters provide a variety of support skills, such as allowing you to earn more Potch or find more items in battle.\r\n\r\nAll in all, fifty-or-so hours well spent, even with my limited free time.",

If you've never seen samples of wacky Japanese TV before, Takeshi's Castle is a good start. This wacky Japanese show throws a bunch of a hundred or so contestants into a series of ridiculous games, each one hoping to make it to the end to defeat Count Takeshi and win one million yen!\r\n\r\nTakeshi's Castle had a Philippine run, hosted by local actors Anjo Yllana and Smokey Manaloto. Although shown on a less popular channel, the show's hilarious antics and ridiculous games earned it a cult following. The games themselves are sheer madness, requiring mostly luck, agility and a whole lot of guts in order to win.\r\n\r\nMost games usually pit you against Count Takeshi's henchmen. The guards hunt you down in the Honeycomb Maze, shoot cannon balls at you in Bridge Ball and roll giant rocks at you in Avalanche. Several games feature the contestants being stuffed into ridiculously large suits that impair movement. The best games are those that run on pure guts, such as the ever-favorite Skipping Stones, where you must quickly jump across rocks to cross a river &#8212; but some of the rocks are fake! If you have nerves of steel, just blaze ahead, jumping from rock to rock, don't care if the one you're stepping on starts to sink!\r\n\r\nMy single most favorite game is \"Knock Knock\", where a contestant is faced with four walls, each with four doors. Three of the doors on each wall are paper... but one is boarded up with wood from behind. The contestant doesn't know which is which, but he must choose a door at each wall and charge through in whatever way he can, usually throwing all of his weight into the attempt -- with horrible results if you choose the wrong door. It's cruel and it's mindless, but you find yourself laughing out loud whenever a particularly enthusiastic contestant slams helmet first into the door. It's all about guts baby.\r\n\r\nI swear, I wish there were some Japanese channel on cable with these types of shows. It's the kind of mindless, addictive stuff that makes TV so dangerous.\r\n\r",

Lots of pictures, and very descriptive.\r\n\r\nI suppose any foreigners coming to the Philippines would say that the situation in Metro Manila is pretty much the same as the one outlined in the article, but after I read it I can't help but feel that it's just a little bit worse over there. But then again, I don't actually drive here anyway -- I just take public transportation and doze off or something. I suppose the situation is better here because we don't have a prevalence of undisciplined scooters as mentioned in the article. For this and various other reasons, I have long ago decided never to buy a car for driving in the Philippines. In the best case scenario, I will have someone driving me around. But I never want to undertake the stress of driving myself.\r\n\r\nI wonder if the situation is generally the same throughougt Southeast Asia? I suppose an even better question would be what would such a situation indicate about the culture of a country? Do we Asians have more inherently chaotic cultures than Westerners?\r\n\r",

So much for my first constructed outing in 10 years... not a very good outcome for me.\r\n\r\nI played 4-color Firemane Control... no permission, but lots of life gain and 4 Wrath of Gods packed maindeck, a specifically anti-aggro build. I was anticipating lots of Gruul beats and Orzhov aggro decks, and I was ready to beat them to the ground. Unfortunately, I faced not a single one of those decks. :(\r\n\r\nRound 1 vs Wildfire/Vore\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI knew this was a loss as soon as he boomerang'ed a Temple Garden on the second turn. First game went fast, I lost to Niv-Mizzet. Second game, he brought out the early Blood Moon, but I had a Hinder ready. The second Blood Moon made it through, so for the rest of the game I only had a Simic Signet providing me with colored mana. Keiga got killed by another Keiga, and he had two cards left in hand. I had two Angels in the &#8216;yard, but no white for removal and no permission in hand. I said, what the heck, and played the Zur's Weirding. He shows me Magnivore and Wildfire in hand. Oh crap. The 7/7 Magnivore took 4 swings to kill me.\r\n\r\nRound 2 vs The Masterpiece\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nIt was my first time seeing the Masterpiece and action, and to be honest, the first few turns weren't very impressive. We traded Hierarchs, creatures were killed by spot removal, it was an even game. Then he plays an Arena, and I realize \"It's over.\" I can match him threat for threat, but he's drawing a lot more than I am, and I don't draw into the maindecked Stomphowler. Game 2 goes pretty much the same way, except I get hit by Persecute -- White... and the secret of this deck is 80% of my spells are white! I go down to one card in hand. He Cranials the 4 Wrath of Gods and the 4 Firemane Angels... and there's no recovering from that.\r\n\r\nRound 3 vs Owling Mine\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI would've thought this was a bad matchup, but the first game went surprisingly well. The extra card draws were great for me, and even when he played an owl, two Angels in the &#8216;yard kept the damage down. Eventually, he ran out of life to give and we started sideboarding. I knew exactly what to board, brought in 3 Grand Arbiters and 3 Hide/Seek. 2nd game went really well for him, Owl on 2nd turn, Boomerang a land, exhaustion, game went fast. Game 3 took a lot longer, he played 3 Owls in one turn, but I had two Hide/Seeks in hand. I kept on tapping out to play threats, hoping he wouldn't draw into an exhaustion. With one turn before I kill him, he amps up the card drawing and gets me to 11 cards in hand, planning to toss two Sudden Impacts at me. But he realizes he's one short -- I'm at 23 life. Besides, I have a helix in hand which forces him to scoop. Finally a win!\r\n\r\nRound 4 vs The Masterpiece AGAIN\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nYeah, same story here. I think my mistake was I keep shooting down Fetters instead of Arenas... but eh, the deck is really far superior.\r\n\r\nRound 5 vs Greater Good\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nWell, my back is starting to ache by now. One of the guys I came here with managed to get a monoblock chair with a back... oh what I would give for that. Oh yeah, the game. I ate a lot of Kokushos and Yoseis, that's what I remember. And he kept using the Top every turn. After a while I stopped caring and didn't even check whether he was cheating me with the Top or not.\r\n\r\nAnyway, it was about 5 PM at that time, and there were 3 rounds to go. But I figured I wouldn't make it anyway, and I had to catch up on work, so I said goodbye to the guys and went back to the office.\r\n\r\nMost important lesson learned: Next time, just play aggro. With an eight-round tournament, playing a control deck is likely to give you a migraine by round four or five. And the metagame is so wide, it's useless trying to prepare for everything anyway, so just throw caution to the winds and send your creatures in the red zone. Oh yeah, a Gruul deck which I helped prepare (the base of the deck came from me) did a lot better than me... his record was 3-2 by the fifth round.",

It got me thinking about my own job. I work at a foreign-based software development company that caters to clients outside the country. These days, I work mostly on JSP-based web projects. My starting salary, three and a half years ago, was higher than the average presented in this graph. Obviously, I'm earning a lot more than that now. I always assumed I was earning more than average; it feels nice to have it confirmed by some data, even if from across the internets.\r\n\r\nBefore I started out in the current job, I wouldn't have thought it likely that I would stay as long as have. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy what I do as a software developer; I've never been close to humble, so I don't mind saying I'm pretty good at what I do as well. But I'm the sort of guy who always dreams of walking his own way, not just being a regular joe employee like everyone else. Such that every so often I get this craving to jump ship and search for a different fortune.\r\n\r\nNot that it's a bad job mind you. Just the opposite in fact, above average pay and work I enjoy doing (most of the time). Sure, it gets stressful at times; especially since I'm currently serving as technical lead on one of the larger projects, such that I often get overwhelmed by technical requests. But somehow I've grown used to it here. For lack of a better term, I've grown some roots.\r\n\r\nAnd yesterday, I was promoted. I haven't been briefed on the details yet, but I know from others that it's not a salary increase thing, more of additional benefits. Still, it's good to be recognized, even if I was expecting it (people were kidding me for months that I was already past due for it... ) Even though I was expecting it, I still failed to gather my usual wordiness and basically stammered a couple of thank you's as my speech. Hey, I didn't expect to have to talk to two hundred people!\r\n\r\nMan, now it's gonna be even harder to resign... \r\n\r",

First things first: First thing I do when I get passed a Ravnica Block sealed deck is to check the decklist to see if I got passed a shockland. Incredibly, I was passed not just one, but two! That in itself paid for the registration fee, but I still wanted to get a decent finish in the PTQ. Unfortunately, aside from the Temple Garden and the Blood Crypt, I didn't get that many \"wow\" cards. Unable to resist what good cards I had, I actually played all five colors: I put in black for removal, put in blue for Helium Squirter (that thing is insane), green for beats, splashing white for Pollenbright Wings and splashing red for Ogre Savant.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately as I realized later, I was so elated by having two shocklands and was in such a hurry to play that I forgot to check my curve. It readily became apparent in later games that I was playing with a sort of negative curve -- most of my good cards were in the 5 to 6 mana range. On hindsight, I suppose I should have put in the Boros weenies. This proved my undoing in both matches that I lost to quick creature rushes. One match ended in a draw, but I just gave the guy the win anyway. (Note to self: Never do that again. Mercy is for the weak!) I went home not just a bit sleepy (having woking up at 5:30 am) with a 2-3 record.\r\n\r\nMust practice more. Unfortunately, the only practice outlet currently is MTGO which is both expensive, and not quite as indicative of the actual environment.\r\n\r\nDecklist follows:\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\ntable

Four of us from the office played at a Nationals Qualifer today at Galleria. I played a custom-built aggro-control blue-white beauty called Azorius-12. Considering that I threw it together at practically the last minute, I think I did fairly well (but not enough to get the Nationals invite). Large turnout; rumor has it more than a hundred and thirty players participated, and NG quickly ran out of chairs and tables to use.\r\n\r\n_\r\n    \r\nEdit 24-Dec-2008: Decklist migrated from the wiki, removed dead link above (anchor tag retained for posterity):\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"decklist\"\r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n    li class=\"header\"\r\n      \"Azorius-12\"\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n    li class=\"header\"\r\n      Creatures\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Azorius Herald\"Azorius Herald/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Azorius Guildmage\"Azorius Guildmage/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Azorius First-Wing\"Azorius First-Wing/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Ninja of the Deep Hours\"Ninja of the Deep Hours/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Court Hussar\"Court Hussar/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Selesnya Guildmage\"Selesnya Guildmage/a\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n    li class=\"header\"\r\n      Spells\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spell Snare\"Spell Snare/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Remand\"Remand/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Condemn\"Condemn/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      3 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Faith's Fetters\"Faith's Fetters/a\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n    li class=\"header\"\r\n      Lands\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Vitu-Ghazi, City Tree\"Vitu-Ghazi, City Tree/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Breeding Pool\"Breeding Pool/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Temple Garden\"Temple Garden/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Adarkar Wastes\"Adarkar Wastes/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      7 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Islands\"Islands/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      6 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Plains\"Plains/a\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n    li class=\"header\"\r\n      Sideboard:\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wrath of God\"Wrath of God/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Repeal\"Repeal/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Seed Spark\"Seed Spark/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Grand Arbiter Augustine\"Grand Arbiter Augustine/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Faith's Fetters\"Faith's Fetters/a\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  div style=\"clear:both\"\r\n  /div\r\n/div\r\n\r\nDeck notes:\r\n\r\nNamed after the 12 Azorius creatures.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nAwesome thing about this deck is that I only had to borrow 3 cards to build it: Remands. This is also the reason why there are no Hallowed Fountains.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nFirst played on 30 July, 2006 -- Standard Constructed Nationals Qualifer at Robinson's Galleria.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nBuilt-in spell snare rocks the house. Every deck has something important in the two-slot, and it's never been a dead draw.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nThe sideboard is rough, because I threw it together in about ten minutes.\r\n\r\n_\r\n    \r\n(end Edit)\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n\r\nQuick match reports:\r\n\r\nRound 1: vs Black-Green aggro\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI played a build similar to this deck last week at Eastwood, so I know it pretty well. Spell Snares are reserved for Jittes and Hands of Cruelty. I take a beating in game 2, come back in game 2, and lose game 3 by a close fight despite an Azorius Guildmage holding down the board.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 1-2, Game record: 0-1 (not a good start)\r\n\r\nRound 2: vs Owling Mine\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nLost game 1, as I was expecting Vore after the turn 1 Sleight of Hand. Siding in Repeals, Seed Sparks and Arbiters, I easily took games 2 and 3. First-wings provide excellent aggro, but Seed Spark saprolings provide the win.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 3-3, Game record: 1-1\r\n\r\nRound 3: vs Ghost Husk\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nHah! Complete and utter domination. There is nothing in black-white aggro that my deck can't answer. His card advantage pales in comparison to the might of Court Hussar! Game 2 I side in Repeals out of courtesy (if I didn't board he might think I wasn't taking him seriously! And Repeals are instant-speed removal... better than Fetters against Husk), but they never show and I still win easily.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 5-3, Game record: 2-1\r\n\r\nRound 4: vs R/G/W Fatties\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nFirst game, he never showed any creatures, I won easily with him stuck at 4 land. I was wondering if I would bring in the Wraths, given that I saw R/G/W from the lands. I decide to not board anything and just see what his deck brings out. Turns out he's playing medium-huge creatures: Burning-Tree Shaman, Firemane Angel, Rumbling Slum. These are the types of decks Faith's Fetters is made to handle. I win with 10 life to spare.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 7-3, Game record: 3-1\r\n\r\nRound 5: vs Firemane Control\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nHorror of horrors... I've now faced variations on two decks that I played before in Nationals Qualifiers. Unfortunately, Firemane Control was not a matchup I was anticipating... and it's a pretty bad matchup for me as well. I have no way to stop the recurring Angels / Shard Phoenix (no Azorius GMs show up to save the day), and my creatures are too small to overtake his awesome lifegain. This deck packs Isperia the Inscrutable!\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 7-5, Game record: 3-2\r\n\r\nRound 6: vs \"Equipment Deck\"\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI have no idea what this deck is called. Basically relies on Godo, Bandit Warlord, Firemane Angel and Sunforger searches to win. I won game 1 due to my awesome weenies. Game 2 our life totals were 21-37 when the round ended... he had a Godo, an Angel, 2 Sunforgers and Tatsumasa out, but the board was locked by a single Azorius GM backed by around 17 lands. Best play: he manages to draw a helix to hit my GM, and I had no cards left in hand. I cast Remand and draw a card. He casts the Helix again, the GM dies and he passes the turn. Then I show him the GM I drew from the Remand... \r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 8-5, Game record: 4-2\r\n\r\nStill have a chance to win packs! (Probably not the invite though)\r\n\r\nRound 7: vs B/W aggro\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\neh, I dominate this guy even more than the Ghost Husk from earlier. I win so quickly I forget to pick up an Ensaymada I had brought to the table.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 10-5, Game record: 5-2\r\n\r\nRound 8: vs Sea Stompy\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nThis U/G/R aggro-control deck is simply awesome. The guy I'm fighting also beat me in Eastwood the week before, and I still don't know what to do against his deck! The deck relies on cheap and quick threats (Kird Ape, or BoP into Ninja of the Deep Hours), and always leaves two mana open at the end of each turn for Mana Leak, Remand or the ever-so-awesome Plaxmanta. He takes game 1 quickly; I side in Wraths for the first time, then manage to win Game 2 after a bit of dragging out. Game 3 we trade blows and counters for a while. But eventually he manages to get out a Jitte'd Rumbling Slum which I pitifully chump block with a few Heralds before giving up.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 11-7, Game record: 5-3\r\n\r\nI finish at 35th place... not bad, but not enough to get an invite. I'm wondering if I'm still going to play at next Saturday's qualifier... which is the last chance for me as I don't plan to go to Baguio to play. But, how can I tweak my deck further to win?\r\n\r",

Unfortunately, I still don't seem to have such powers and the head pains and dizziness I've been experiencing since Friday were just a sympton of something far more common -- seems I got the flu, known in local parlance as trangkaso.\r\n\r\nThis has not been a particularly good weekend anyway. Since Saturday morning, this computer I have in my room has been flaky, occasionally refusing to boot into either Linux or Windows, and occasionally not even turning on at all. My brother and I suspect a loose video card, and if were just a little less lazier we could easily confirm it by swapping the video card here with the PC in the other room. I threatened to nuke the installation completely and reinstall XP, but once I put the XP installer in the drive, it started working again, imagine that.\r\n\r\nAnyway, since I'm not inclined to waste more time checking it out. If it acts up again, I'll probably ask my brother to bring it to a shop. I just wish there were some really good specialist shops that maintain your computer hardware for you. The sort of shop where each customer has a personal file, and when you bring in your machine the guy behind the counter would recognize you and say, \"Hey Mr. Tang, how's that new DVD-ROM drive working? Hmm? Faulty memory? Let me take a look... \" And you'd know your machine would be in good hands with someone you can trust, a professional who does this sort of thing for a living and not just some anonymous college undergrad trying to make a few bucks.\r\n\r\nI still haven't seen Superman Returns. I haven't been posting lately because of Civ IV... that game is addictive, and I hear an expansion is coming out. I've beaten Prince level now, yay!",

I was a bit sleepy, but because of work I wouldn't be able to play in the Coldsnap-standard Magic tournament on the 26th, so I decided to blow some cash by playing in a Coldsnap release event on MTGO instead.\r\n\r\nI managed to win five consecutive rounds of Coldsnap sealed, piloting a mediocre decklist. Mediocre meaning I had neither Adarkar Valkyrie nor Ohran Viper. Nonetheless, I got lucky at just the right times, and made quite a few good plays. Vanish into Memory is awesome, especially with Panglacial Wurm.\r\n\r\nAround 8am I was struggling to keep myself awake awaiting the sixth round when we got a short power failure. Power came back up in ten minutes, but my internet connection did not. That pissed me off. Since I'm also going to the office this afternoon, I have no fuirther chance to win the CS release championships. I think I'll lay off Magic until the Time Spiral prerelease.\r\n\r\nMike, if you read this, are we buying a TS box?",

Now, whenever one has idle time, one of the first questions is, \"Hey, where's the DS?\"\r\n\r\nMy experience with the DS is unfortunately limited to just one cart -- New Super Mario Bros. The funnest thing about New Super Mario Bros. is the buttload of minigames that comes with it. Even though we only had one DS to share among roughly fifty people, we kept passing it around trying to beat the minigame high scores.\r\n\r\nThen a second developer decided to bring his DS to the office... and lo and behold, we were exposed to the DS' wireless networking capabilities.

The Philippine Star's headline was most apt: &#8216;Milenyo' shuts down Metro. Literally. Most places in Luzon lost power before noon of Thursday, owing to ravaged electrical transmission lines and substations. As of last night, at most 60% of areas have had power restored. Luckily it included both my place of work and place of residence, as losing access to electricity makes me feel like a peon in the dark ages. I wonder what peasants did back then after nightfall, how did they while away the hours without internet connections (okay, and TV too)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of internet connections, mine came back up just now, allowing me the luxury of catching up on a few blog posts before coming in for work. Despite the conditions, I was at the office up to almost 4 in the AM today, and I'm coming back for more.

Quite a bit, actually, for some expensive medical / family reason. Large amount, six digits (in pesos), roughly two-thirds of my current cash savings (To save you the math... my cash savings were somewhere between 150,000 and 1.5M). Funny thing is, I didn't hesitate a bit. I knew this guy and he was okay, I didn't have any reason to doubt he'd pay me back in a month like he promised (it's due in about a week.)\r\n\r\nAm I insane? Who lends out that amount of money just like that? Since I try not to borrow large amounts of money myself I have no idea. I told a couple of people later that I was lending out a large amount and they were like \"Well I'm sure you considered it very carefully.\" No I didn't!\r\n\r\nIt's not that I regret the decision of course, I'm pretty sure I'll get my money back and I got to do a good deed.

Reminds me of one of those \"self-inserts\", a term used for fanfiction where the author writes himself in.\r\n\r\nIn any case, one more book before the end of King's epic twenty-years-in-the-making western fantasy saga.

If you get a Celestial Crusader early this is a good choice.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nBlack Weenine -- a bit tougher, you have to get a bad moon early\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nSlivers -- W/U combinations focus on board lock down and pinging to win. R/G combinations focus on acceleration and beatdown.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nThallids -- tedious and slow. Don't do it. If you keep getting passed Sporesowers it may be viable, or if you open an early Thelon. The Thalld Shell-Dweller is an excellent early blocker. The Deathspore Thallid is ok.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nBlue morphers -- I did this in one game, I think I got one of each nonrare blue morpher. Fledgling Mawcor gives you board control, Fathom Seer gives you card advantage, and Brine Elemental locks the opponent down for a turn, allowing the alpha strike. Consider this if you get Vesuvan Shapeshifter early, but you might need to splash a second color for more control.\r\n\r\nRed seems the color that's hardest to stand alone with, but is easily splashable.",

There are a lot of people like me who view having to line up and pay for your food as a rather large inconvenience. If you're one of us, consider the following guidelines.\r\n\r\n  Know what you're going to order. \r\n  \r\n    Don't be one of those annoying people who chats with all her friends while they're waiting in line, then when they get up to the front of the line they spend 15 minutes discussing various options with the guy behind the counter. Walking up to the counter without knowing what you're going to order is the most inconsiderate thing to do to people in the line behind you. This isn't a five-star restaurant where you have a guy waiting on you, this is a frickin' fast food where you have five other people lined up behind you just wanting to have a bite.\r\n    Just last night I had to stand in line behind a lady who was ordering for her family. Every few minutes she'd look back to her husband and two kids seated at one of the tables and ask them what option they'd what. The cashier would ring up the bill, but before her orders are ready she has something new to ask for. \"Oh, you serve fries here? Can we have a large?\" What, have you never eaten at a burger joint before?\r\n    \r\n    _\r\n  \r\n    (Note: I actually wrote this post a while back after a particularly irritating lady was in line in front of me.

Bogardan Rager in particular I underestimated.\r\n\r\nAt least I can somehow feel my skill level improving. There's this guy who's beaten me two tourneys in a row now, both with edge-of-the-seat wins decided in a single turn. I found out later he's currently in the top 10 limited players in the country by ranking. All 3 of my losses were against highly-ranked guys, and all went to a close game 3. I suppose there's some minor differential in skill that I'm lacking before I could handle these guys and consider myself rising out of the mid-tier. I feel that I made a lot fewer play mistakes this time and that I can improve significantly in deck construction. Some more experience would help, and maybe I'll do a few sealed decks on MTGO when the time comes.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I finished 31st (best finish I made in a PTQ) and won one pack!",

The ending of season five was pretty bleak -- Zod had taken over Lex Luthor's body, Clark had been banished to the phantom zone, the whole world's power grids had been shut down and Martha Kent and Lois Lane are on a plane that's about to crash. I was expecting some sort of multi-episode saga at the start of season six, maybe detailing more of Kyrpton's history (throught the phantom zone) and an epic battle of Zod-Lex vs Clark.\r\n\r\nInstead, what do we get? A series of somewhat-badly-written-and-quite-unlikely coincidences gives the humans a chance to save their world, short Dragonball-style battle sequence and an inane homage to the ending of Superman II. Seems they tried to pack too much into one episode. And at the end of it all, we seem to be right back at the status quo of season five. (More or less) I wonder how the people of the world are going to explain away the bizaare happenings that day?\r\n\r\nI hope I did not spoil anything for anybody. Anyway, rumor has it Green Arrow appears in this season. Huh? Come on... if we were going to have a wealthy playboy / superhero appear in Smallville, why not a certain Dark Knight?\r\n\r\nThe most annoying thing about Smallville is that Clark is basically an anonymous hero, he never gets the hero's payoff, never gets the girl, is never recognized for his efforts save for those few souls who know his secret. Of course, that's how comic-book Clark Kent gets treated as well -- but he has an iconic and well-loved alter ego to soak it all up.\r\n\r\nMy brother has told me that he has heard a few good things about the new NBC series Heroes. Maybe I'll take a look at it. Since this is probably Smallville's last season, I'll need some more superhero hijinx.",

The product arrived late though, and Switch and I had to wander around Galleria for half a day before the tourney was able to begin.\r\n\r\nAs witnessed in the prerelease, Time Spiral seems to be immensely popular, which means high demand and low supply of boosters for the general public. And for good reason: Time Spiral is awesome, and provides an incredibly fun (and sometimes technical) limited environment. What it will do for Standard is another matter, but since I'm primarily a limited player... \r\n\r\nAnyway, my sealed card pool had some good ones, but an overabundance of spot removal and card draw made me consider R-B-U, even though I had advised Switch only hours earlier that R-B was shallow in TS limited. What sealed the deal were the trio of Bogardan Hellkite, Nicol Bolas and Sol'Kanar the Swamp King. Getting one of those beasts into play basically meant winning the game!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I did not do as well as I'd hoped. I plowed through the first 2 matches easily, but lost the last two. I must've given my opponent most of my luck in round 3, as I managed to cut his deck to a Mystic Enforcer in all three games. Round four, game one was close as I lost after running out of answers to his blockers. Game two had me winning on the back of Sol'Kanar while sacrificing all my other creatures to chump-block his Evil Eye (which prevented his other critters from attacking). Game three was a blowout though, as he gained a quick aggro advantage and quickly burned through all my removal.\r\n\r\nMatch record: 2-2. Game Record: 6-5\r\n\r\nI guess my mistake was that I had built quite a slow deck. I didn't have any decent plays until turn three at the earliest. And most of the time, I would just play a Chronatog Totem. If I got to the late game safely, I could easily win.\r\n\r\nGreat cards: Fathom Seer, Mystic Teachings (searches for Bogardan Hellkite!), Think Twice, Careful Consideration, Strangling Soot, Assassinate, Smallpox, Pit Keeper\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nNot-so-hot: Lim-dul the Necromancer\r\n\r\nNext Saturday is constructed, I wonder if I can have a deck ready by then...",

For some reason or another, I was a bit out of sorts, not really into what I was doing. Not wanting to waste company time being ridiculously unproductive, I decided to take an early dinner break and wander around Ortigas Centre for a bit.\r\n\r\nI suppose everyone has their off days. You know, those days when you're not particularly sure what the hell it is you're doing or why you're doing it. This was one of those days. I walked around a bit thinking random odd thoughts like \"I wonder what would happen if I just went ahead, took out all my cash from an ATM and vanished forever from this life?\"\r\n\r\nThere are people would miss me, sure; but they'd get over it. The current project would get hit by a crisis for a short while; but they would recover in a week or so. I'm pretty sure there are far too many people in the world for the loss of one identity to have some catastrophic impact. My real concern was wondering what I would do with the new-found freedom, what kind of new life would I set up for myself. My preferences went towards any sort of normal 9-to-5 job where I could just come in, do the minimum amount of work I could, then leave as early as I can, getting a lot of free time in the process. Well, at least a lot more than I have now.\r\n\r\nThat's ridiculous of course; I wouldn't last long living a life where I had to spend 8 hours a day doing some inane thing like being a store clerk. No offense to those people who \\are\\ store clerks, mind you; I'm sure there are many good reasons why they are store clerks. It's just that none of those good reasons would be good enough for me.\r\n\r\nThe current job is actually great in that it constantly challenges me, pushing me to find smarter ways to do things, to be brilliant, to rise to the challenges. But it's not perfect. There are periods of time where the team has no choice but to go into crunch mode. Like now. And any developer can tell you, when your team is in crunch mode, you can literally feel the weight of the world on your shoulders. Luckily, many of the devs on the current team are still hard-working and still have a bit of fight left in them, hopefully enough to see the project through. But I'm starting to feel the weight myself; I don't think I've ever been this tired of a project before.\r\n\r\nInstead of becoming a hobo, I figured I'd take a vacation after the project is done. I've already told the appropriate people that I'd like to take a two-week leave before moving on to the next project. But right now, two weeks seems a bit lame. I'm thinking a bit more... maybe two or three months. I don't even care if it's unpaid.\r\n\r\nI mentioned this to a colleague, and she told me I'd be bored out of my wits by the end of the first week. Wow, that's ridiculous. As long as I have electricity, I don't think I can be bored. (Didn't we just lose all electricity across Luzon last week? Shut up.)\r\n\r\nI figure I'd spend one week just cleaning stuff up and sorting it. Yeah, I sort stuff, I'm geeky that way. And yeah, one week. I don't even have a lot of stuff per se. It's just not very organized right now.\r\n\r\nThen I can spend some time on a hobby that I've neglected for the past two or three years: game development. I don't plan to look for work in the gaming industry anytime soon, given that the current work conditions in commercial game development are a lot worse than I would be willing to tolerate. If ever I break into the gaming industry, it's probably as an indie game developer. Anyway, right now I'd just want to finish one damn game. Before I started my current job I didn't have enough programming experience or discipline to get it done. But now I think I can safely allot 2-3 weeks for a simple random-dungeon roguelike. After all, an experienced game programmer was able to do it in a week, I figure three times that amount of time should be enough for me.\r\n\r\nWhat else would I do during this theoretical 2-3 month break? I also want to write a book. Not that I think I'm any good or anything, I just wanna give it a go. I'm not particularly good at world-building, so I'm thinking it'll probably be some generic fantasy-type template world, and the story would be more person-centric than world-centric. So no epic world-saving sagas or anything. I'd also want to try something more science-fictiony, but I think the fantasy stuff would be easier for me first.\r\n\r\nRest of the time would be spent net-surfing, blog-reading, maybe twinking around with Ubuntu, WoW, Magic: The Gathering, Final Fantasy XII, etc. Maybe even some exercising.\r\n\r\n\\Sigh\\ it's nice to dream of vacations. That being said, I'd probably only do a 3-4 week vacation at most. Aside from the fact that anything longer than that costs me a bit of salary, I think I'd actually miss the job and the people there. Strange, but probably true.\r\n\r\nOh, I eventually had dinner at Jollibee at the Megamall food court.\r\n\r",

Well, at least not as many as some people. I generally prefer the ones with feeds. Here are the ones I follow that don't have feeds. That is, I like them well enough to bother hitting their website to check for new comics.\r\n\r\nSinfest -- awesome. It's like a mature Calvin and Hobbes. Only with a talking pig instead of a tiger. And ninjas. And God!\r\n\r\nReal Life -- gaming-related webcomic. Despite it's title, has nothing to do with Real Life at all.\r\n\r\n8-bit Theatre -- gaming-related webcomic. I think this was the first one I started following. Ever.\r\n\r\nCtrl Alt Delete -- gaming-related webcomic. The humor is oftentimes low-brow, but it has some funny spots mostly due to slapstick or just plain insanity.\r\n\r\nOrder of the Stick -- gaming-related webcomic. of the tabletop RPG gaming type that is.\r\n\r\nShortpacked -- toys-related webcomic. Occasionally funny. I read it mostly so I can get a sense of an industry that I like but don't really have time to interact with.\r\n\r\nQuestionable Content -- eh, I'm not sure why I follow this. I'm not sure I can explain it, so from Wikipedia: \"the style ranges between romantic melodrama, humor about indie rock music, and sexual or scatological humor\". I started reading it a while back and I stuck around. Not really funny. Well maybe it is if you follow indie rock.\r\n\r\nAnd the ones that do have feeds:\r\n\r\nPenny Arcade -- to be honest, if I have to explain Penny-Arcade, you have no idea what webcomics are. If so, and you are a gamer of any sort, go read it.\r\n\r\nMegatokyo -- ditto. But to a lesser degree, and mostly for otaku.\r\n\r\nPvp Online -- this one is not as popular as the above two, but popular nonetheless. It's about guys working in a gaming mag, so more geekiness abounds. Eh, my feed for this seems to be dead. I'll look for a new one.\r\n\r\nxkcd -- this is awesome and geeky, but not in the usual geeky way. The description is \"A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language.\" Read it, maybe you'll like it!\r\n\r\nEdit: Well, I was trying to figure out why I didn't have feeds of the first group, and I checked, and now I got feeds for all of 'em!

But is it really all raiding? I don't think I'd be able to devote 12+ hours on weekends for raids. 3-4 hours maybe, but 12 hours? Well, my brother just hit 60 recently, so I suppose I should ask him after a few weeks what it's like.\r\n\r\nBut then again, I'm the sort of person that likes multitasking, the thought of spending 12 or more hours in a day doing the same thing sends a shiver up my spine. So I doubt I'm ever really in any danger of getting addicted in that way.\r\n\r\nOne could argue that it's a person's own responsibility to make sure he doesn't become overly addicted to any one thing, MMORPGs included. One would think that a person who allows himself to become addicted to MMOs would have just been addicted to something else had the MMO not existed. But MMORPGs are still a strange new thing to our society, one that we haven't yet been taught how to handle, one that does not yet have those society-set levels that define how much is too much. And one cannot deny that the ability to interact with people from all over the world with an avatar of your own choosing would seem like a powerful opportunity for growth.\r\n\r\nBut the worst pressures in the game supposedly come from other players. After reading the article, I'm not even sure I want to be involved in raiding (although I suppose it depends on what other end-game content is available), as a raiding guild can probably exert a lot on peer pressure for one to commit more time to the ever-addictive game.\r\n\r\nThis phenomenon doesn't really exist only for MMORPGs though, it's just a lot easier because of the social factor involved. It can happen with offline games as well, especially open-ended ones. I once knew someone who brought her home computer to the lab at school for the sole purpose of being able to play The Sims while at the lab. And whenever I dropped by the Lab, there she was, happily clicking away to earn her Simoleans. MMOs like WoW are infinitely more deep than The Sims because of the interaction\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nwith other players and the constantly improving game content.\r\n\r\nAfter all is said, Blizzard has made one hell of game, one that provides a virtual escape for many people. I suppose one should just be careful that it adds something to your life instead of taking away.\r\n\r",

I've been agonizing over the past couple of weeks as to what I can play in the diverse new standard enivornment. In the end, instead of doing my usual thing and building an original decklist, I decided to work from an existing archetype instead. I believe that in order for me to become a better Standard player, I have to get more match experience before designing decks, since my thinking is still on a casual level most of the time.\r\n\r\nBy Thursday evening I had decided to go for a modified Ghazi Glare build, with a red splash for reach. My decklist, named \"Elephant Glare\":\r\n\r\n4 Call of the Herd\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Birds of Paradise\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Yavimaya Dryad\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Loxodon Hierarch\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Thelonite Hermit\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Selesnya Guildmage\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 Thornscape Battlemage\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 Llanowar Elves\r\n\r\n3 Glare of Subdual\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Assault // Battery\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 Demonfire\r\n\r\n4 Temple Garden\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Brushland\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Stomping Ground\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 Gemstone Mine\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Selesnya Sanctuary\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Pendlehaven\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Vitu-ghazi , the City-Tree\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Forest\r\n\r\nSideboard:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 Squall Line\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Krosan Grip\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Moratorium Stone\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Mwonvuli Acid-Moss\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Giant Solifuge\r\n\r\nMostly a midgame, aggro-controllish deck, despite the high creature count (32???). I go into the tournament with attitude that is just basically a playtest for the next few tourneys.\r\n\r\nRound 1 vs mono-white proclamation-tron\r\n\r\nThis match was disappointing, as it was the first. My deck simply has no way to handle the life gain from multiple Martyr of Sands. I managed to win game 2 off a fast clock. Game 3 I had a good start as I managed to use several Acid-Moss to keep the Tron from coming online, but eventually he had me locked in again with Martyrs, Proclamation, Howling Mine, Chronosavants, etc. He was at 40+ life when he managed to play Akroma. I hold her off with Glare of Subdual and eventually get out enough guys that he's forced to Wrath away the Akroma. But he has the Debtor's Knell in play, and my sideboarded Moratorium Stones failed to appear. I can't recall, but I may have made a misplay at some point when he hard-casted a Sunscour and I had a Hierarch in play, I forget if I had the mana open to save my guys. But I certainly didn't think about it.\r\n\r\nLoss: 1-2\r\n\r\nRound 2 vs UR Vore\r\n\r\nYay! I've faced UR Vore several times before, so I'm pretty familiar with how it plays, and I crush him easily game one, working around the counters and generally ignoring the land destruction thanks to the almighty Yavimaya Dryad. Game 2 I stall a bit, and he takes me down with an 8/8 Vore. Game 3 I'm back in business, hitting back-to-back Dryad and Acid-Moss into Herd tokens. I overextend a bit since he shows no sign of having Wildfire yet. Despite a Tidings and a couple of Sleight of Hands he does not draw the &#8216;Fire. I eventually empty my hand and play the hellbent Demonfire for the win.\r\n\r\nWin: 2-1\r\n\r\nRound 3 vs Marnel featuring Vesuvan Lockdown\r\n\r\nMarnel is an officemante, and he and I were playtesting last night and his deck was a slightly difficult matchup for me -- I won 2 out of 4 games but both wins were based on really good draws. So he and I face off in round 3 and I'm like, \"This is just a playtest, so we're not going to draw, right?\"\r\n\r\nMarnel's deck plays morph guys -- lots of 'em. He'd only finished the changes last night. It's an awesome deck and fun to play. And most importantly, people won't know how to handle it! As long as he doesn't play any insanely fast aggro, he's got a good chance of winning.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I am not insanely fast aggro, and we go to a close game 3. During my last turn I'm at 2 and he's at 5 with a SSS in play. He did the Thelonite Hermit + Vesuvan Shapeshifter bit during the last 2 turns, so he has a battalion of saps on his side and I will surely lose with his next swing. I decide to go for the draw: \"Squall Line for 5?\" But he shows me the Cancel.\r\n\r\nThe loss means I don't get top 8 status anymore, but this is just practice. 😀\r\n\r\nLoss: 1-2\r\n\r\nRound 4 vs UW control\r\n\r\nI've played this guy a few times before. He's a nice guy, but he always plays blue =p I eat his deck alive. During Friday's night testing I was able to handily beat a deck that had four Wraths and three Pyros, U/W is a pushover. I don't even think I saw any offence. I finish with the Demonfire on game two and I love the surprised look on their faces when I do that.\r\n\r\nWin: 2-0\r\n\r\nRound 5 vs ugr beats\r\n\r\nSometime during the match I morph a Thelonite Hermit and he's like \"Eh? Is there still Morph in Standard?\" =/\r\n\r\nAnyway, this seems like a weaker version of Sea Stompy. I see no Slums or Plaxmantas or Snakes, and I know how to work around the permission. Win game one no problem. Game 2, I was at 9 and he had two mana open so I psyched myself out and did not Demonfire his Yavimaya Dryad + Moldervine Cloak. Oops, lost to Char on the next swing. Game 3, he has a bad draw and only gets two lands out early, plus birds and elves. I hit the Acid-Moss when he taps out for a Viper that trades with an Elephant. Demonfire and Thornscape Battlemage take out 2 birds, and he only has a Karplusan and a Llanowar Elf and a Giant Solifuge out. He's at 5 I'm at 6, I pass the turn. He looks at his hand and swing with the Solifuge. I have a guildmage, a morphed hermit and the battlemage on my side, so the easy play is single-block the Solifuge and swing for six (with the Guildmage pump) the next turn. I'm about to do that, but I realize he hasn't made a land drop yet! If I take 2 from the Solifuge, he can play Mountain, Char for the win! I do the double-block trading 2-for-1, since I'm ahead in board position anyway. He frowns and plays Island, go. I swing with the Guildmage, bringing him down to three, then play 2 more Guildmages. He frowns again, realizes he can't play Char anymore, then offers the handshake.\r\n\r\nWin: 2-1\r\n\r\nRound 6 vs ugr tron\r\n\r\nSheesh. This was even easier than the Vore from round 2. I don't think I saw any offense. The magnificent Acid-Moss rears it's ugly head again. And also my awesome power to cut Wildfires to the bottoms of decks.\r\n\r\nWin: 2-0\r\n\r\nRound 7 vs Monoblack Aggro\r\n\r\nAfter round 6 I was hoping I'd get paired with this guy... I could take his deck any day of the week. Game one starts out like this:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMe: Stomping Ground, go\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nHim: Swamp, Rusalka\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMe: Land, Assault on Rusalka\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nHim: Swamp, Dark Confidant\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMe: Land, Assault on Confidant\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nHim: Swamp, Dark Confidant\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMe: Land, Assault on Confidant (topdecked the Assault -- ah, Assault and Dark Confidant, you were made for each other)\r\n\r\nI eventually overwhelm him with Elephants. We go to game 2, and he has a not-so-awesome draw and plays four Bad Moons over the first five turns. He gets a swing in with a 5/5 Nether Traitor, but on my turn, I play the ever-so-awesome Glare of Subdual. I have the Ghazi in play, so I just keep pumping out saps to hold off the ever-increasing army of dudes. He made the mistake of telling me he was waiting for the Plagued Rusalka to come out (so he could finish off my saps with the Rusalka + Nether Traitor combination attack), so I alpha-strike him with just enough damage to kill.\r\n\r\nWin: 2-0\r\n\r\nThis was my best constructed finish for this year: 5-2 (How sad.) I finish 11th, enough to win 3 booster packs.\r\n\r\nThe breakout performance was however, Marnel's Vesuvan lockdown deck, which he piloted to a 6-1 (Number 1) finish. Props to him, this deck is awesome and fun to play, both with and against. It's also a very technically involved deck, there are lots of tricks involved, especially with Willbender. I wish I was as successful with my attempts to go rogue. =p\r\n\r\nAll in all, good practice. I'm planning to play on each of the next 3 weekends as well.",

He plays a Sacred Mesa with only six lands in play (I took out a couple with the Acid-Moss) and I think \"Good luck maintaining that.\" I put up more pressure and finish with the Demonfire for three.\r\n\r\nRound 4: 1-2 vs RU Control\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nGame one sees me getting beaten down bad. He has tons of counters, plus Hellkite and Teferi for the finish.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nGame two I go Elephant, Elephant, etc. He doesn't have the answers.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nGame three he controls the game completely. I don't bring him below 18.\r\n\r\nRound 5: 0-2 vs UWR Angel Control\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nGame one sees an early Firemane and I'm unable to recover.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nGame two I bring him down to 9 and I have the Demonfire! He repeals a Birds of Paradise to allow the mana leak to counter, and I lose to Lightning Angel beatdown.\r\n\r\nAt this point I'm starting to feel a bit light-headed. I think I'm coming down with a cold.\r\n\r\nRound 6: 1-1-1 vs UWG Control (appears as 1-2 in the record)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nGames one and two are boring.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nGame three is quite possibly my stupidest move in the past year. We're both down to 10, he swings with five pegasus. I consider the lone Squall Line in my hand. \"Squall Line for 4?\" Remand. I take the 5 damage. My turn, I topdeck the Demonfire, assuring victory! I swing, saps make it through and bring him down to 5. And thus my stupid move: I played the Squall Line first, and ANNOUNCE IT FOR 5. Goddamn, I must've been really out of it. I was so excited by the topdeck that I failed to think. Stupid. Stupid. Stupid. I offer my opponent the win, since he can still hit top 8 (he was paired down), and he can just split the packs with me.\r\n\r\nRound 7: 2-0 vs Dragonstorm\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI didn't even care anymore, I just kept playing the Elephants one after another. Dragonstorm is just. Too. Slow.\r\n\r\nI finish 4-3, 19th, winning one booster pack, plus two packs from the 6th round deal.\r\n\r\nThat was a bit disheartening. Islands in every battle! I'm tired of this deck, I think I'll switch to a different deck next time. Something named www.IHateIslands.com.\r\n\r",

And now that I've read the final volume of Stephen King's magnum opus, I find out that it is an even crueler fate that awaits him at the end of the seven books.\r\n\r\nI dare not spoil it, though Wikipedia has a nice summary, say thankya. Save to say that Stephen King seems to be correct -- the ending of the Dark Tower series does seem to be the \"correct\" one, despite some disappointments in writing.\r\n\r\nAll in all, the Dark Tower series remains an incredibly good read, and Stephen King is admirable for having completed the epic story over a more than twenty-year period. People often know King as the \"guy who writes those creepy horror stories\", but the Dark Tower series shows his bent is really towards a type of dark fantasy. I wish I had time to read his other novels, as many of them tie up with the Dark Tower story itself.\r\n\r",

Basically, for a few days during holidays, 8-man drafts no longer require the usual 2 tickets to play. You simply need the product used for the draft (3 booster packs) in order to join an 8-man draft. And since the payout is also in booster packs, distributed as 4-3-2-2, you can basically keep playing 8-man drafts for free as long as you get at least two wins per draft.\r\n\r\nI just finished the fourth draft off an initial 3-booster pack (12 dollar) investment, so I basically got 13 packs for the price of 3. I finally lost in round 1 of draft 4. It's addictive, I think I'll play some more!\r\n\r\n(Nix Tix weekends are a bit hard on my credit card... )",

My instructions were to find the McDonald's inside the airport and look for the exit nearby. Sure enough, the signs pointed me to the bus terminal. I bought a ticket, and as I arranged my luggage for easier carrying I didn't notice that I had dropped the just-purchased ticket to the floor. A pretty Caucasian girl picked it up and smiled as she handed it back to me. I smiled back and gave her my best \"Thank you very much.\"\r\n\r\nI got on the bus and took a seat near the back, hoping that I would be able to see clearly out the window so as not to miss my stop. Seated on the row of seats in front of me were seven women, some middle-aged, some looking like they had just gotten out of high school. Even if they were speaking English I would have been able to identify them as Filipinas. From their dialogue I could also tell they were domestic helpers. Apparently they've never met each other before today, and here they were talking amongst themselves as if they were long lost friends. I guess when you're a long way from home any connection is a welcome one.\r\n\r\nOne of them is the central speaker, she's apparently been in Hong Kong for more than seven years now and had just come back from a vacation in the Philippines. She answers some questions from the others: what can I do on my day off? where do I go? how can I call home? She tells them stories of her life in Hong Kong, how the family she works with has been really good to her and they get along well. If you're lucky, you will be assigned to a family like mine, she says.\r\n\r\nThey miss their stop; I guess she's not as familiar with Hong Kong as I assumed. I look out the window and spot Victoria Park, and I know I'm getting near my stop. I get off the bus at just the right place, and I look for the staff quarters.",

Minor land destruction theme (4 Cryoclasm, 4 Mwonvuli Acid-Moss), Elephant and Solifuge beats and always going for the Demonfire finish. The black was in the main only for Hit // Run, my answer to Akroma and Bogardan Hellkite. Sideboarded Nightmare Void against control.\r\n\r\nRidiculously huge turnout, over two hundred people participated, meaning the event would play out for a total of nine rounds. I got my fourth loss in the seventh round, after a ridiculous string of bad draws that led me to mulligan down to four and keeping a no-land hand. After this, I dropped out of the event, damn tired after having to endure one and a half hour rounds. This was already at 9pm.\r\n\r\nI don't have any detailed report, as I was still really sleepy, having had little sleep since flying back from Hong Kong. Some highlights:\r\n\r\n-- Maindeck Cryoclasms are great, I never faced any opponent where it wasn't relevant.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- Round 5 I played and beat National Champion JT Porter, playing a UB control deck with Teferi and Dralnu. I didn't get it either, but he put up a good fight, losing when he miscalculated and did not have enough mana to use Mystical Teachings to search for the Commandeer that would push away the lethal Demonfire.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- Round 6 I played another high-ranked local player, Ogie Jaro playing Martyr-Torn. I won game one on the back of fast aggro and Hit on a Chronosavant, but didn't see the Martyrs until game 2, where he ended the game at 95 life. Round 3 I had the Rain of Gore in the opening hand, managing to play it on turn two, stopping his combo. However, I failed to draw any more meaningful spells, instead drawing into a ton of lands. Two 1/1s finished me off. He played incredibly well, never taking the bad draw for granted. He played a Wrath when I only had an elf and a bird, and he had 2 1/1s and a Chronosavant, just to stop me from getting to lethal Demonfire mana.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- If your opponent is playing WG, always side in the Krosan Grips, at the very least you will get a Glare. And you might even take out that Worship that you weren't expecting.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- I plan to put Fortune Thief in the SB next time\r\n\r\nMy next constructed outing will probably be after PC comes in, I'll probably just tweak this deck. And try not to be sweaty so that my lands stick together and I have to mulligan four times.",

Isn't that reason enough? I want to have a period of time where I am entirely free of responsibility, with no agenda or itinerary or plan whatever. One day I could just decide to walk around the city, or even more likely, stay at home and have a DVD marathon. I'm going to spend some time by myself doing things that I enjoy, things that I don't usually have time for when there's work. Unfortunately, I am neither a born tourist nor a born shopper, so those are not the things I'm going to do.\r\n\r\nMy mother even thinks I should visit some tourist spots so that my break is \"productive\". I'm not really sure how walking around and looking at stuff could be considered productive. I'm no tourist; I'd prefer not to spend my time doing something I find quite a bit boring. Granted, since I don't have any planning whatsoever, I may very well decide to go sightseeing or whatnot. But I sure as hell wouldn't plan it.\r\n\r\nI actually have a to-do list of things I want to accomplish during the break. But everything is optional.",

I find the articles about the indie gaming field very enlightening, and I have to say going the route of an indie game developer is much more appealling to me especially after reading about all the issues game dev studios have with big-time publishers.\r\n\r\nAm I still thinking about getting into game development? Maybe, but not as much as before. I've come to realize that one of the important reasons I want to make games is because I love playing games. So actually, as long as there are good games coming out, I don't think about it much. And I suppose I'm not yet brave enough to embark on such a risky venture for myself, but maybe someday... \r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.escapistmagazine.com/issue/77/8\r",

Don't get me wrong, I'm fairly generous. If you ask me for something as a Christmas gift and I could afford it, you would most likely receive from me a gift-wrapped bundle with said gift. But to expect me to be able to think up a gift for you by myself? You would be placing too much faith in me.\r\n\r\nThe above explains why I'm also hardly excited about Christmas presents anymore -- I don't expect them. People are great in that they give you stuff, but I wouldn't be disappointed if someone chose not to get me a gift; even someone close to me, like say my parents. Not that they ever fail, mind you. I'm pretty sure every year I get at least one new article of clothing. Which is good because otherwise I'd never get any new clothes at all.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying I'm a scrooge by the way. I like Christmas, I still do. But it's no longer the gifts that I enjoy. It's the festive mood that it brings out of people. The priest at Mass today that we Filipinos are the best in the world at celebrating Christmas, and that's a fairly good exhortation. People here _change _in December, even the grumpy ones who don't particularly like holidays and festivities and socializing (I'm partly guilty of that -- I'm no social animal) I think that's a lot better than presents any day of the week.",

So I needed to catch up to about three weeks worth of news and blog posts, missed downloads, episodes, etc. Conveniently, I just marked as read all Slashdot and Boing-Boing posts in Bloglines hehe\r\n\r\nUnlike the online world where things are ever-changing and skipping out for three weeks might mean missing the next big thing, life in the Philippines seems to continue to stay the same. It's still quite hot despite the Christmas season; the temperature difference was obvious as soon as the plane doors opened. Apparently our local politicians did something stupid and people got angry and wanted to go protest. These are of course the same politicians who do stupid things all the time, and also the same people who like to go to protests all the time.\r\n\r",

I found a copy of The Rock&#8216;s book, _The Rock Says _going for the bargain basement price of 50 pesos (roughly 1 US dollar). What a steal!\r\n\r\nIn case you've been living under, well, a rock, you're probably aware that The Rock was one of the most popular, most electrifying men in professional wrestling, lovingly termed \"sports entertainment.\" As a wrestling fan, such a book is a real page-turner for me. It details the story of Rock's childhood, his football days in Miami up to his days in the WWE leading up to his historic Wrestlemania XV match with the Rattlesnake, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin. As a fan whose view of the wrestling industry has been limited to what I've seen on television, the book gives a good look into the inner workings of the industry. The history, the way things are, the pitfalls, the demons of the wrestling biz are explored by The Rock's stories, especially his days of growing up to become a third-generation wrestler.\r\n\r\nThere are people in the world who don't \"get\" professional wrestling, wondering why others like to watch it when it's \"so obviously fake.\" Those people miss the point entirely, and reading \"The Rock Says\" might do give them some insight as to why it's called \"Sports Entertainment\" these days. But for wrestling fans, especially those who grew up watching the trade blows with the likes of Mankind and Steve Austin, the book is just one hell of a ride.\r\n\r",

Main deck cryoclasm is good, as 5 out of 7 opponents had the requisite islands or plains to be targetted. Spike Feeder keeps me alive against Boros/Dragonstorm. People are usually surprised when I play the Strangling Soots in games 2 or 3, but the Soots do something unbelievably good against aggro decks: they trade evenly with Call of the Herd.\r\n\r\nRound 1:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n0-2 vs Mono-green aggro\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nUgh. Not a good way to start the day. Multiple weenies, some sporting cloaks or armor, definitely a weakness of my build. I drew mostly lands too. This matchup is probably around 40-60 in their favor, as I need to draw into 2 strangling soots to win, or bring out a Fortune Thief (backed by a Spike Feeder) to stay alive.\r\n\r\nRound 2:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2-1 vs Dragonstorm\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI felt that I had a good game one against Dragonstorm, but I made a misplay where I didn't play the second spike feeder that would've kept me alive. Even with four dragons out, as long as I survive, there's a chance to win because of Hit // Run. Game two I managed to resolve a Persecute for red, bringing his hand to one mountain. Game three, he didn't draw the storm.\r\n\r\nRound 3:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2-0 vs Rakdos\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nLucked out here. First game, opponent had mana troubles, only three lands came out, and one got taken by an Acid-Moss. Second game, I was able to deny him of black sources\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nthroughout the game, and a Solifuge wrapped him up real nice while Strangling Soot cleared the blockers. Thing about land destruction, it really punishes bad draws.\r\n\r\nRound 4:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2-1 vs WGr Aggro\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nHis deck was mostly Elephants (Call of the Herd / Hierarch) and random small critters, plus Disintegrate as a finisher. First game, I got him with the second turn ryoclasm + Acid-Moss on the Selesnya karoo. Game two, I sided out all the LD, and brought in the Soots and the Grips, expecting Sacred Ground, Worship, and/or Glare. He drew three Call of the Herd and I couldn't stop the stampede, I took damage down to 5 and he showed me the Disintegrate. Game three was a race, but I had a Solifuge and an early forestwalker, and the Demonfire in my hand for the win.\r\n\r\nRound 5:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1-2 vs UR Tron\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI was playing in a bad mental state here, holding back on my spells for fear of permission. A friend who was watching rightfully told me that keeping my spells in hand doesn't reduce the number of counters he had. I should've been playing threats one after another until I could resolve a Hit for massive damage. In the second game, my weakness to Pyroclasm becomes the end of me as it kills half my mana.\r\n\r\nRound 6:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2-1 vs Triskitron\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI knew what to do this time. His hand runs out of counters and he desperately throws Demonfire for 16 at me. I stay alive and respond with Demonfire for 9, winning the round. Mental note: When they play the Compulsive Research early, they have a bad hand and are looking for permission! Based on experience during the Gold Rush tournament, I usually side out the Cryoclasms against &#8216;Tron -- they usually have only 4-8 viable targets, and I'd much rather have a Persecute or Krosan Grip available.\r\n\r\nRound 7:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2-1 vs Simic-Tron\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI like the matchup against SimicTron better, as they have Breeding Pools that the Dryads can walk through. The dryads take him down in game one despite the presence of a Sky Swallower. Game two, I'm confident of winning; I have the hellbent Demonfire in hand and he's within reach. But I fear the Commandeer, so I point the Demonfire at a nearby Hellkite instead. Completely illogical, I lost game two because of that. I was thinking I would wait for a Persecute to clear the hand before going for the Demonfire. Game three, he was able to handle all my threats except for an early Elf and Dryad, which took him down to 1 life before he was forced to Wildfire to clear the board. PS Demonfire for one.\r\n\r\nAll in all, a pretty good performance for a \"Rogue\" decklist, 5-2, although I had seriously bad tiebreakers so I finished in 17th place, last among the 5-2's. And I didn't get to test my mettle against Boros. And seriously, the metagame here... it's like 50% of people are playing some X-tron deck.\r\n\r\nOne more Standard tournament next week before Planar Chaos!",

Basically it's a Start - Run replacement -- press a predefined hotkey and a small command line tool appears where I can type shortcut-like commands. One of the features I liked while using Kubuntu was something similar -- I think it was called Katapult. It sorts of automates an old trick I was using before, where I would put shortcuts to commonly used programs in a predefined folder that exists on the path. I'll see if this is better than that one, since this one requires less effort to set up the shortcuts.\r\n\r\nSecond is an egg-timer type app, AleJenJes Countdown Timer -- I don't know why it has such a weird name. But anyway, it's just a simple Stop/Go timer I can use for timeboxing.\r\n\r\nLast is a Window WP right-click menu addon, FileMenuTools. Some nice common tasks can be added to the context menu, some I do regularly.\r\n\r\nI've also looked at some a few PIM programs, but my experience is that I'm not very good at this sort of thing... the only one that's stuck to me for a while was GTDTiddlyWiki, and I don't even use that regularly anymore. I'm thinking I should find some way to integrate task management into my workflow. Maybe I could write the program myself, the requirements are simple:\r\n\r\nI want to be able to specify tasks that I want to be reminded of. As an initial example, maybe I could schedule daily, weekly or monthly tasks.\r\n\r\nAt the start of each day, or when I boot up my computer (configurable), the program would dump all tasks for that day in the middle of my workflow.\r\n\r\n-- At the office, it could send me an email.\r\n\r\n-- At home, I could add a local web page to my Firefox tabs.\r\n\r\nThat's basically it. I can add more features or bells and whistles later. I could probably put together a quick scripts + text files solution, similar to the\r\n  \r\n[\r\n  \r\ntodo.txt series at lifehacker][5] \r\n  \r\n-- in fact, I'll go read that first for ideas.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.bayden.com/SlickRun/\r\n [2]: http://www.gonebowlin.com/freeware.html\r\n [3]: http://www.lopesoft.com/en/index.html\r\n [4]: http://shared.snapgrid.com/index.html\r",

I got there about ten minutes after the mall opened (I came from work), and I was already preregistered, but I only got to sign up for the sixth flight (Flight F). They had to buy extra tables from a nearby Office Warehouse. I finally got to crack open packs around 12:30PM.\r\n\r\nOnly bomb in my sealed deck pool was an Avatar of Woe, but my black was too weak to support it. I went for a U/W aggro build to take advantage of a Serra Sphinx I opened.\r\n\r\nQuick Hits:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nDamnation seems easy to get -- 3 of the people I knew who were playing opened it.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI opened 5 rares in 3 Planar Chaos packs, one was a foil Shivan Wumpus.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMy first round opponent was apparently a prerelease virgin; after giving a beating with his creatures for most of game one, he played an Oros the Avenger hoping to finish me off. Luckily for me, he was playing the actual prerelease card, which is a no-no. I won the second game, game record: 2-0; match record 1-0.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nSecond round opponent was red/white again. I've never played against Giant Growth in limited, but one would expect it to be a house. After getting hit by Brute Force twice, I'm inclined to agree, and have now learned to play around combat tricks when the opponent only has a mountain. I won 2-1. Game record: 4-1, match record: 2-0.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nThird round opponent... some red also. First game I only saw an Avalanche Rider and the 7/7 echo guy. Second game he put up more of a fight, and the \"free echo\" goblin helped him a lot. He get out the Goblin Advisor and went all aggro on me before I managed to stablize. Those exploding goblins can't get past a Dream Stalker! Game record: 6-1, match record: 3-0.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nFourth round opponent... well, it seems everybody but me plays red. First game I played out all the tricks my deck had with a Clockwork Hydra. Auramancer's Guile + Hydra meant I could attack without losing +1/+1 counters. He bounces the Hydra, I play it again. He shoots the Hydra, I save it with a lion. He forces my Hydra into a bad block, I blink it out. He tries to Lightning Axe, I flashback the blink. This game was way fun on my end.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nSecond game goes long, but he later drops a Pyrohemia. Bomb enchantment! And I had no way to remove it. I tried to play around it, but his Paradise Plume eventually gave him enough life that he could just burn me out with the red Pestilence. I quickly gauge my options: ten minutes left in the round, but my deck is more aggro. I still have enough time to win game 3, so I concede and shuffle quickly.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nThird game I draw a hand with five lands, a morph guy and the Serra Sphinx. The morph guy doubles as removal (gives +2/-2), so I figure this is good enough, as I don't miss the 3rd-turn creature drop. Bad decision, as I draw into even more lands, and he's more aggro than usual. The game goes long again, and eventually he surprises me with a Teferi I didn't see the first two games. I sigh and realize I'm probably going to lose when he flashes the Sorceress Queen-timeshift at end of my turn. We go to time. And I try to stop him from killing me in three swings. Not enough blockers.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nFinal game record: 7-3, match record 3-1. I had good enough tie breakers to finish 4th in the pod, and I hoped I could still get a shirt for such a good performance. No such luck though. I take my 3 packs anyway, hoping I get good stuff.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI did. (1 Angel of Fury, 1 Groundbreaker, 1 Timbermare)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMy flight finished at around 6PM. By this time I had gone with around 2 hours sleep in the past 14 hours, and the only food I had was two ensaymadas for a late breakfast before the flight started. Yeah, dead tired.\r\n\r\nNotes on specific cards:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nThat 3cc blue common morph guy, the one that gives +2/-2? He's awesome. I'd pick him high.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nSaltfield Recluse was a card I initially underrated and did not play main. However, I ended up bringing him in every time I could. That -2/-0 really screws the combat odds in your favor, and saves your guys from the occasional bad block or combat trick.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nSpeaking of combat tricks: yeah, Brute Force is pretty good.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nWhitemane lion is essentially a combat trick with a free bear.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nPongify is fun as expected. I loved it when my opponent attacked with a 7/7 he had just paid echo for, and I shake my head, show him the card and say: \"Monkey?\"\r\n\r\nOverall, the set is awesome for sealed deck play, the block environment looks good. The design of the cards isn't particular innovative since everything is either a throwback or a reprint, but the choice of cards and abilities to bring back... everything is awesome. I'm definitely going to play the release tournament.",

People who've eaten out with me on a regular basis know that I'm quite the picky eater. In general, I dislike eating veggies and seafood (yeah, I'm an unhealthy carnivore). In Hong Kong, you cannot avoid vegetables and seafood; every meal comes with some form of green stuff or shrimp or whatnot. I'm almost always eating out with the HK colleagues, and since I'm a guest in their country, they'll always invite me to taste everything. I've probably eaten more seafood in those three weeks than I have for the previous years of my life. I'm probably exaggerating, but there's a good chance of me being correct.\r\n\r\nSince most of my days were spent in the Wan Chai area, we often had lunch and dinner at the restaurants there. Anyone who's been to Hong Kong will probably know about Wan Chai: the area is full of bars and nightclubs and such. It seems that the area is frequented by foreigners. In the evening, many of the clubs have some pretty young women outside enticing passing Caucasian guys to have a drink or two. Of course, I didn't go into the bars or nightclubs because that's not the sort of thing I do.\r\n\r\nLunch was the expensive meal of the day, since we usually had to pay for it ourselves (as opposed to dinner which was company-reimbursed). The HK guys would usually decide where we would all have lunch and we just go along with them. Most meals cost around 40 HK$ -- more than 2.5 times I normally spend for lunch back home. But these meals are usually larger servings and good quality stuff, not fastfood-level or carinderia-type junk. We get soup, plus drinks (I usually order Lemon Iced Tea or Milk Tea) then the meal itself. Usuallyyou have some meat or fish, plus veggies on the side, and you can choose your viand from rice, spaghetti, mashed potato, etc. Many restaurants allow you to choose from a list of set meals, so sometimes I joke that I can just choose randomly, \"Today I'll have meal B\" and just order it without asking what it is. But of course I'm a picky eater, so I don't.\r\n\r\nSince dinner is company-sponsored, it seems the HK guys always choose cheaper places for dinner. We ate once at a McDonald's and once at a Yoshinoya. And several times at this small chinese place that had a TV. I kept trying to follow the plot of the TV show aired during dinner but the inability to understand Chinese makes it hard.\r\n\r\nWell, of course being unable to speak Chinese makes almost everything hard -- I need to ask for help whenever I'm ordering, etc. I also started out quite bad with chopsticks. Despite my years of honing hand-eye coordination using the game controller, my dexterity is terrible, and that leads to being really bad with chopsticks. On my first Sunday there, I had to eat lunch alone at a cafe. I ordered some pork with noodles in soup (I like noodles), but I had trouble eating since I'm not used to eating noodles with chopsticks. I tried to ask the counter lady for a fork, but she and I couldn't understand each other. I wonder if the other cafe patrons noticed me eating the noodles in a terrible manner.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if my time in Hong Kong would change my eating habits when I got back home, making me less picky in what I eat. Turns out, not by much.",

I did a hundred million things, maybe. I dunno. I didn't keep track. I read a few books, wiped quite a few TV episodes off my backlog, learned a few new programming tricks, cleaned up some stuff, finished a few games, and God knows what else. If I bother to explain this, I would often get that lopsided look from people saying \"You wasted your vacation on that?\"\r\n\r\nI don't get this concept of \"wasted vacation\". The whole idea of a vacation is to have free time to one's self. Maybe for some people that means going off to some island resort or traveling overseas or something. For me it means I get to waste my time on whatever the hell I feel like doing when I wake up in the morning. (Or often around lunchtime.)\r\n\r\nA lot of people burn away all their days working on a job they don't even enjoy, now that's what you should consider a waste of time. Not that I don't enjoy my job, but I certainly wanted that break (and I'm pretty sure I earned it.) I didn't have anything in particular to do or accomplish. I simply wanted to have free time.\r\n\r\nPost Part II:\r\n\r\nI came back to work just in time for annual assessment time, a stressful time for many people, as they wonder how much of an increase they're going to get, if any. Well, it's not a stressful time for me, as I don't really care much about the increase. My current compensation was already pretty good anyway, so anything I get this year is just a \"win more\" situation really.\r\n\r\nWhat I would really appreciate (and I've told them this before) is more free time. I like my job, even enjoy it every so often. But I really enjoy my free time as well, and I actually wouldn't mind taking a significant (say, 20%) salary cut to gain one day of free time per week.\r\n\r\nA lot of people say time is money. What many people don't realize is that time is more important than money. Money is simply one of the things time can be translated into. But time can also be transformed into other, more important things that money cannot provide: personal growth, the company of your loved ones and the freedom to be your own person... things that make the flexibility of free time far more valuable than mere money.",

Like Naruto, they don't live in a world very different from our own. The One Piece universe is a lot more insane than Naruto's though. I've only watched less than a hundred episodes, but so far the Straw Hat Pirates have encountered giant sea cows, talking reindeer, a guy who can eat anything, a man-shark... too many to mention.\r\n\r\nSide note: It's really difficult to multitask when watching anime. I can watch episodes of 24 or Smallville while working since I can rely on the audio to keep track of the story, but since I prefer my anime subbed, it really needs my full attention to watch it.\r\n\r\nThe series is pretty good, occasionally funny, and doesn't have the same pacing problems as Dragonball (the pacing of the Naruto anime seems better though). The action is decent, most battles are simplistic slugfests where Luffy and his crew win simply by more \"will to win\"; a typical thing in these types of anime. The only complaint would be that they spend too much time summarizing the previous episodes at the start of each new one, but that's a problem only because I watch multiple episodes at a time.\r\n\r\nI have more than a hundred episodes to watch, and since I can't watch them during work I typically marathon at least ten episodes on weekends. At this rate I'll be done in, what, half a year?",

Most of my gaming is done on the NDS these days, though I wish it had even more good games (When is Phantom Hourglass coming out anyway?)\r\n\r\nAt work, there are two groups of gamers who bring portables, one is the NDS group, the other is the PSP group. Currently, there are more NDS gamers, but not by much. Everything is friendly, and every so often the NDS group ribs the PSP group about getting NDS because they're so much better, and of course the ribbing goes both ways. I think the PSP is nice, but it's still expensive (twice as much as NDS), and the games are more \"eye-candy\" type than I'd like. NDS games are fun and innovative, while the PSP games feel like they just want you to play PS2 games on a handheld, and I'm not terribly excited by PS2 games anymore. (Of course, the announcement of a Final Fantasy Tactics port for the PSP really makes me green with envy... )\r\n\r\nActually, the feature that would make me want to get a PSP is that you can watch videos on a decently-sized widescreen handheld. I can watch videos on my NDS as well, but the resolution isn't as good.\r\n\r\nAs for PC gaming, well, I don't find anything terribly exciting on that front. In fact, I cancelled my WoW subscription today, since everyone at home is too busy to play nowadays. (Will probably reactivate it around summer so my brother can get some Burning Crusade goodness)\r\n\r",

The highlights of the movie are the very impressive battle scenes (which is like 90% of the movie), with awesome usage of slow-motion to enhance the battle drama. It feels like a video game!\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I think the movie was hyped a bit too much for me. It's good, but not OMGWTFThat'sAwesome!!!111 good for me. History lessons told me how that battle ended, and some of the lines in the movie sound like trash-talk from WWE shows.\r\n\r\nStill enjoyable though, despite the high theater prices nowadays. It's just that I went in expecting my socks to get knocked off; they rolled up a bit, but they stayed on my feet.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by noemi on 2007-03-30 18:22:55 +0000\r\ntoo hyped in fact that during the first few minutes i found myself\r\n  \r\nanticipating for the scenes that will make me go wow (and i hate it when that\r\n  \r\nhappens 'cuz even if the film is good, i sometimes feel dissatisfied)",

I played with my friend Paul, and we had a rather good sealed pool, coming up with a pair of decks that had the basic strategy of \"Do not block!\"\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, we were only able to go 5-2, ending up as the team in 10th place. Well, it's not like we would've been able to go to San Diego, but still the 750USD would have been nice. We lost one game to mana flood, and the other loss was one where we were winning -- at least until the opposing team decided to take 3 turns in a row via Walk the Aeons.\r\n\r\nWe could've won that last one though, but we made a few mistakes such as not being aggressive enough, i.e. deciding to block. The thing about Magic tournaments, you pretty much need to have at most one loss in order to hit top 8, and you can assume you're gonna get at least one loss due to mana screw; so there's really no room for error or bad plays. You must make the best play at every possible time. It's a demanding game.\r\n\r\nThe new 2HG format is a lot more fun though, with the thiry life leading everyone to choose aggro strategies. And since you only get one game per round, there's a lot more pressure involved, and it's not uncommon for decisive plays to take 5 or more minutes to decide. Fun, but mentally exhausting.",

        "content": "---\r\nauthor: Roy\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2007-03-11 08:26:36\r\ntitle: Searching for Direction\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2007/03/searching-for-direction/\r\n---\r\n\r\nI'm sure a lot of people have experienced it, the feeling of being adrift, directionless. Just living your life day in and day out not knowing where you're going or why. Maybe not everybody though, as I've met quite a few people who seem quite content with the monotony of their lives, doing the same thing day in and day out, never bothering to overcome the inertia of their daily lives. Lately, I've been afraid that I've already become one of those people. My current lifestyle, such as it is, has been quite satisfactory for quite a while, and I could comfortably live the rest of my life this way. I see no need to change directions or shift gears.\r\n\r\nLately, a friend of mine mentioned that he would probably move to another company soon. That got me thinking again about my own career plans, about whether I would even consider moving to another company. And the conclusion I came up with was \"Where would I go?\" Moving to a different company isn't really a change of direction if it was still the same line of work. I've actually already mentioned it before to the people who give me my performance reviews: if I ever leave my job, it would probably be when I decide to go out and do something new. What kind of \"something new\", they would inevitably ask. And my answer has been the same for a while: I don't know.\r\n\r\nI like to read all these lifehacks, self-help, etc. stuff hoping it would help me decide what I want to do with my life, but so far I haven't found my answer yet. The default path is of course to just stay the course, keep working in the company (or at least in the industry), and move up the corporate ladder or something. But there's always that yearning to break away and to do something for myself; something outrageous, wild, fantastic and / or that will cause people who know me to question why I would throw away a perfectly good, safe and stable career.\r\n\r\nThe answer is \"Because I want to be a rogue.\" I want to walk the road not taken. I want to blaze my own trail. I want to leave something behind and be remembered for it.\r\n\r\nI just wish I knew what the hell that something is.\r\n\r\nIt's not that I can't think of something I'd want to do. There are actually a lot of things I want to do. But I don't have time to explore the options and figure out which one is the best one, the one I'd enjoy the most and hence the one where I would most likely be successful.\r\n\r\nWhat is it holding me back? One thing is my job of course. As a friend of my said, somehow I've already planted quite a bit of roots there. But I would be willing to risk leaving it behind, if only I was sure what I would be leaving it behind for.\r\n\r\nAnyway, that's my resolution for this year, right? \"To find direction.\" So I have until the end of the year to try to find time to explore my options and find my direction.\r\n\r\nWhen I started to write this post I meant to end it with \"And if I can't pick a direction by year's end, I'll just choose one and GO!\". But truth be told, I want to stay with the company a bit longer, to watch it grow. And to be honest it's really still a valid option to stay, as I genuinely enjoy the work and would probably like to stay at least a while longer to hone my skills in this industry. (And I like the people in the company too) The only real problem with the job is that I don't have much time to pursue other avenues of interest. Therefore I allow myself the safety of deciding that my direction would be \"Stay for a while and see what happens.\"\r\n\r\nWill I choose an ordinary life or a daring life of adventure? Or try to pursue both ends, working as a mild-mannered programmer by day, and writing my own destiny by night?\r\n\r\nWell... this post didn't end quite like I'd hoped. That happens sometimes...",

I win handily and bring in Electrolyze, Pyroclasm and Serrated Arrows for game 2. Game 2, he had like six small guys in play, I was down to 3 and had 6 mana open. My cards in hand are plaxmanta and remand. I play plaxmanta, in response, remand the plaxmanta, draw my card and show him the topdecked Pyroclasm. Too bad he folllows up with two Spectral Force over the next few turns. =/\r\n                /p\r\n                \r\n                p\r\n                  Game 3 I lost due to a bad play on my part. My opponent was tapped out with like 5 creatures that are also tapped, and an untapped Mangara (with summoning sickness) On my side, I have a morphed Shapeshifter and morphed Brine Elemental, with Stomping Ground, Plaxmanta and Demonfire in hand. My opponent is at 18, I'm at 10. I have six lands in play, if I play the Stomping Ground and take the two life loss, I can lock him down with the Brine Elemental. I'm not sure what I'm thinking however, I play the Stomping Ground tapped and Demonfire the Mangara for 1, then swing for 4.\r\n                /p\r\n                \r\n                p\r\n                  The correct play should have been:\r\n                /p\r\n                \r\n                p\r\n                  -- Play stomping ground. lose 2 life (down to 8)\r\n                /p\r\n                \r\n                p\r\n                  -- Attack with both morphs, Mangara does not block\r\n                /p\r\n                \r\n                p\r\n                  -- Unmorph Brine Elemental, opponent takes 7 and drops to 11\r\n                /p\r\n                \r\n                p\r\n                  -- Opponent's turn: no untap phase, does nothing\r\n                /p\r\n                \r\n                p\r\n                  -- My turn: Swing with morph and Brine Elemental.

I won the second due to aggro, and we want to game 3. Game 3 was close, very close. During his turn, he was at 4, I was at 6, he had a Mindslicer and a Rack in play. I have no board and 2 cards in hands. He's afraid of the Demonfire, so he plays Smallpox, saccing the Mindslicer, hoping to have us both in topdeck mode and me with no answer to the rack. I let Smallpox resolve, and respond to the Mindslicer trigger by playing Plaxmanta. Plaxmanta survives, and will swing on the next turn for 2; he's at 3 and I'm at 5. However, it seems I have no answer to the Rack. My turn, untap, upkeep take 3 from Rack (down to 2), I draw a land and hold in my hand. I swing for 2 with the Plaxmanta, bringing him down to one. But it looks like I'm losing to the Rack. I pass the turn to see what happens. He draws an Extirpate and starts looking through my &#8216;yard, and I spot the bad play. I HAD A THINK TWICE!!! I could have avoided 2 points of Rack damage, enough for the Plaxmanta to seal the deal. Gah, I am teh suck.\r\n                /p\r\n                \r\n                p\r\n                  I take the well-deserved loss and drop from the tournament, quite tired. A really bad result for me after more than a month of cutting back on Magic tournaments, not a very good comeback. However, I think the playtesting session was a success, as I found quite a few weaknesses in the deck and also found that I like playing it, it's quite fun. So, I will probably tweak this deck and continue to play it in Standard tournaments for the time being. I probably won't play in Block Constructed until FS comes out, so is my deck for April.\r\n                /p\r\n                \r\n                p\r\n                  In the next part, I will pick apart the deck and see what I can improve. Stay tuned!\r\n                /p",

So much for being a devout Catholic.\r\n\r\nAs is tradition, most of the long weekend was spent watching a whole lot of stuff:\r\n\r\n24 \r\n  \r\n-- I've been keeping pace with the episodes so far. The thing about 24: people die. A lot of them. And amazingly, Jack Bauer gets off every single time. They should have a season where Jack Bauer dies around episode ten or something (or at least gets hospitalized and taken out of the game) That would shock people. Still a very entertaining show.\r\n\r\nHeroes \r\n  \r\n-- still need to watch the latest episode (18), luckily they decided to take a break so I can catch up. Heroes started out strong and with solid writing, but the plots and subplots started to get a bit messy after Peter saved Clair. It looks like they're finally getting on track again these last few episodes though.\r\n\r\nOne Piece \r\n  \r\n-- I finally caught up to Kaizoku Fansubs, having started watching One Piece from the very beginning last January. I had to skip most of the fillers though to catch up. And from the pirated DVDs I've seen in some stores, there's probably some other group subbing One Piece that are already at least eighty episodes ahead of KF. That being said, I think I'll follow their pace for now, as their subbing is of really good quality. One Piece is an awesome series and continues to be entertaining. The best arc in the series so far has been the Alabasta arc, and I'm looking forward to Movie 7 which supposedly covers this arc.\r\n\r\nGintama \r\n  \r\n-- a new series that people at the office got to know from Jump Ultimate Stars for the NDS. It's mostly a parody/comedic anime, often breaking the fourth wall and using a lot of puns, references, toilet humor and visual gags. There are some really funny bits that made me laugh out loud, but it's a bit of hit-or-miss unlike, say, Excel Saga, which would have me laughing a good 70-80% of the time.\r\n\r\nAs I said, uneventful.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.kaizoku-fansubs.com/\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by noemi on 2007-04-12 19:25:26 +0000\r\nnamatay naman si Jack ah,...  for a few minutes nga lang. hehe db? the season when david palmer was assassinated? i like Heroes. sayang ung nabili ko na pirated hanggang ep 17 lang, pero i was able to watch ep 18 on dailymotion. you should check out the official website also, to see the interactive novels/comics. ganda. plus it gives the story more meaning. have you seen Prison Break? the first time my heart pounded from the suspense was while watching Runaway Jury. surprisingly, that happened to me as well while watching Prison Break, well at least with the first 12 eps i think.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2007-04-12 23:49:25 +0000\r\nDespite having a copy of the entire first season of Prison Break in the house since last year, I have yet to watch a single episode. I don't have time to marathon it. Funny stuff takes priority (usually anime) before serious stuff. And 24  Heroes  Prison Break, so last priority sya hehe.\r\n\r\n Comment by peng on 2007-04-13 23:59:51 +0000\r\ni've stopped watching heroes. too slow for my low eq. i don't see how they are going to defeat sylar if peter does not stop being such a wuss.",

The last few days seem to be one of mine.\r\n\r\nHealth-wise: My stomach has been in a rebellious mood for the past three or four days, I actually went to work with a fever last Friday. Also, it seems my blood pressure was a bit high since yesterday. I'm thinking about going in for a checkup within the next week or so, depending on how my condition changes.\r\n\r\nWork-wise: Annoying problems which we've been trying to solve for the past few weeks seem to be snowballing into a critical mass that threatens to derail the current project. I feel so guilty here because at least one of those problems were caused by some really bad design decisions I made early on in the project. Ah, the pitfalls of being a rookie technical lead... \r\n\r\nWell, now that I've written this stuff down, I guess it isn't so bad. Work is work, whatever happens won't kill me. The health stuff might, but I've never let it get me down before, why start now?",

I got there before Galleria opened and whiled away time on the DS. The NG staff was a lot more efficient today, they were able to start the first 3 flights as early as 10:30. I got on flight C, and proceeded to open one of the most mediocre card pools I've ever seen. I quickly judge that the best synergies among my cards were (a) six black removal spells and (b) I have a lot of thallid cards (gernimator, sporesower, deathspore, and the new 5cc 4/4 guy from FS). I ruled out the blue/white evasion strategy despite having a decent number of fliers, since I hate going without removal. So I assembled my no-bombs deck, of course calling it \"Deathspore Thallid Go!\" as my officemates would have wanted.\r\n\r\nI won the first two rounds and was well on my way to winning round 3 when my opponent suddenly cast a Dragonstorm into Scourge of Kher Ridges in game 2, allowing him to wipe my board away. He tries the same thing in game 3, but I manage to take out the Dragon with a Tendrils and an Ichor Slick. That causes me to go into topdeck mode though, and he quickly lays down a swarm to overwhelm me. Round 4 I almost lot to a sliver deck, but it seems my opponent was not aware that Firewake Sliver gives haste... he could have easily pumped his 4/4 flying Gemhide (thanks to Griffin Guide and graft) for lethal damage, but missed the chance.\r\n\r\nSo, my finish is again 3-1, same as the PLC pre-release. My overall record for Time Spiral block is 10-2, not bad I suppose.\r\n\r\nMy opinions on Future Sight? My deck was almost 80% TSP anyway, so it's hard to say. In general red seems pretty good in the set, getting some decent burn in the form of Ghostfire. As for creatures, Gathan Raiders, as I expected, are quite good; that 1/1 that suspends itself when it dies is a bit annoying, Grandeur is useless in limited, and yes, Angel of Slavation and that Scourge of Kher Ridges are pretty much bombs.\r\n\r\nThere should be one or more TSP limited events over the next two weeks... I hope I can open decent cards the next time around...",

Very entertaining game, it puts you in the shoes of a novice defense attorney, Phoenix Wright and your adventures in trying to uncover the truth behind several murder cases. The gameplay is composed of two parts: investigative sequences where you go around various locations gathering information and evidence, and the actual trial part where you have to spot contradictions in witness testimonies and prove your clients to be innocent.\r\n\r\nThe original game was for the GBA, so the first four cases don't make much use of the DS platform apart from being able to use the stylus to select stuff. The fifth case however is added exclusively for the DS and features additional gameplay mechanics like the ability to rotate pieces of evidence and using the DS stylus and microphone to simulate the fingerprinting process. The fifth case is also much more difficult. The first four cases are easy enough to brute-force (\"trial and error\") your way through, but the fifth one is much more complicated and it had me stuck for a while since I couldn't figure out how to proceed in one of the investigative parts. (That and I started playing FFVI Advance)\r\n\r\nOverall, a good game, but people who aren't used to this style of Japanese games might get frustrated at some parts. I'm looking forward to the sequels.",

I have a fairly good paycheck, I like my job (more or less), I like the people I work with, and they recognize and respect me for my contributions.\r\n  \r\nLovelife na lang ang kulang :p \r\n\r\nAnd because I'm a simple person, if I have something to raise, I raise it as soon as I think about it; I'm not going to bottle it up until someone asks.\r\n\r\nOf course, I still have my own ambitions or hopes and dreams. It's only natural to want to strive for something beyond yourself. And we all face problems, sometimes seemingly larger than we can probably comprehend. But no matter what goals we set out for ourselves or trials we face, you can always follow back on the simplest principle in problem solving: break things down into simple steps.\r\n\r\nA hearty meal. Time with the people you love. Respect from your peers. A good nap. The best things in life are simple. Life is too short to make it complicated.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by peng on 2007-04-14 00:01:26 +0000\r\nkiller last paragraph there. i agree wholeheartedly. i always thought you as the introvert, pero di ka pala nagiipon ng galit. good for you.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2007-04-14 08:22:57 +0000\r\nI guess I still am pretty much an introvert, albeit a loud one. Never talaga ako nagiipon ng galit, kahit nuong HS pa tayo. In my opinion if  \r\nyou have a problem, either it's worth talking about it or you should just let it go. 🙂\r\n\r\n Comment by peng on 2007-04-19 22:15:03 +0000\r\nyou know, i don't know if being that open is a good or a bad thing. i cannot for the life of me keep anger inside or at bay. while i am \"inis\" it comes out as rants then disappears. healthy for me, i guess, but for other people who have to bear with the grumpy, growling penguin? good luck on that lovelife quest. hehe.",

Not being in the mood to feel like french toast during this Sunday noontime, my brothers and I decided to troop to the nearby mall and catch a movie -- in this case the return of those childhood stalwarts the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles to the big screen.\r\n\r\nNow, as my youngest brother asked, what were we doing there? TMNT is a kids' movie right? Yeah, more or less I suppose, but all of us brothers saw the first 3 live-action Turtles movies, played the NES game with the annoying dam sequence and watched not just a few episodes of the cartoon series. Thankfully, none of us had any Turtles jammies.\r\n\r\nAnyway, yeah we saw the movie. Before I saw the trailer about a month back I actually thought it was gonna be another live-action thing. The animation is ok, the turtles look less brutish than before and it's action-packed as expected. As expected, Leo tries hard to be a leader, Mikey provides the comedy, Raph is the serious brooding one, and Donatello provides the tech support (literally). It's no high art, but it's entertaining enough, but it's pretty much the equivalent of watching a multi-part episode of the TV series. The turtles have a spat, they kick some ass, extradimensional monsters appear, the turtles kick some more ass, etc.\r\n\r\nI hear that the movie is selling quite well in the States. Not so much here though, as the theater was maybe 50% full at best, and on a Sunday afternoon at that.",

Luckily, I have a dual boot computer, with Ubuntu as my alternative OS.\r\n\r\nUbuntu is pretty awesome. As a Windows replacement, it does most of the things you need without much problem. It has two distinct advantages over Windows:\r\n\r\nThe Debian package distribution mechanism is just great. Virtually everything you need is provided and can be installed easily. In Windows, every single program decides how it wants to be installed.\r\n\r\nThe customizability of the UI. I'm pretty sure this one rates a lot higher for geeky fellows than ordinary folk though.\r\n\r\nHowever, there's something that makes it really difficult for me to go pure Ubuntu permanently: gaming. Wine/Cedega is a pretty lame substitute. And with the Future Sight online release coming up, I decided I needed to have access to Magic Online again, so I got hold of an XP installer and tried to fix my XP install.\r\n\r\nThe freaking XP installer wiped my partition table.\r\n\r\nAfter running the XP installer just to see what options I had for repairing the previous Windows installation, I found that the Grub bootloader wouldn't work anymore, my PC refused to boot at all. I lost some 60GB of downloaded data that day. (I was able to recover some 4GB of personal data... pictures and such.) Up to now I'm still wondering if the XP installer saw that I had a different OS installed and just had a \"Oh yeah? It's me or nothing!\" tendency.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I'm on a clean XP install now. I'll probably reinstall Ubuntu some time (dual boot again), but for now I seem to be another Microsoft sheep again.\r\n\r",

I'm no lover of the GMA administration, but the opposition's offerings don't leave a very good taste in the mouth either. I'd much rather bring in new blood, non-politicians like the Kapatiran guys.\r\n\r\nOr maybe I should just go with the recent ads that have appeared exhorting people to boycott the senatorial slots altogether?\r\n\r\nThis election seems so...  bleah.\r\n\r\nAlthough I should note, I think AGHAM party list is a good idea.\r\n\r\nAt least the mayoral elections in Quezon City are a no-brainer.",

As a relatively recent smartphone release, it cost quite a chunk of cash. I was having second thoughts for a while, because I'm almost never comfortable parting with a significant amount of cash. If I'm going to spend more than a week's salary on something, it better provide me with a decent amount of entertainment\r\n\r\nI was also hesitant, because I didn't really need a new phone. It's not like I'm the type of guy that buys shiny new stuff just so he can show off to other people. Hell, I've avoided having a phone until, what 2005? Getting a smartphone is pretty much an indulgence. I'm not buying a new phone so much as I am buying a new toy. As I said to one of my officemates \"I want a phone that I can really tinker with.\"\r\n\r\nThat being said, I'm sort of settling into the purchase now that the exchange has been made. I like the camera handy. I like having an MP3 player handy. I also find a phone useful. So having all of these functions in one device is pretty okay I guess. Ooh and it also has a radio! How quaint!\r\n\r\nI would post a picture, but I'm not yet sure how I can get the phone to take a picture of itself.",

If you are any kind of serious voter, you should at least bother to know your candidates' full names!\r\n\r\nI realize the above two \"reforms\" would at first glance make it difficult for voters when casting their ballots but that's actually part of the point. I'm not sure that voting is _supposed _to be easy. The duty of each citizen is not only to vote, but to vote wisely and according to what he belives will be right for the country. You're not supposed to rely on sample ballots or name recognition.\r\n\r\nSample ballots and nickname voting are crutches created to herd sheep into voting for people by name alone. Without these crutches, I'm hoping at least a few more people will be forced to think about the choices they make during election time. And that those who are too lazy to think get so put off by the needed effort that they don't bother to vote.

I opened a card pool with no outstanding rares. The only real bomb was the red uncommon Pyrohemia. Spotting the Deep-Sea Kraken and wanting to play it, I decided to go red-blue. I tested the build for a few minutes before realizing it completely stunk and had very few creatures. I looked over the card pool and quickly realized I had overlooked some quality green fatties: Nacatl War-Pride, Durkwood Baloth, Sporesower Thallid, etc. During the last minute of deck-building, I switched to a red/green build with a rather nice curve that proved quite solid.\r\n\r\nI went 5-1 in the first six rounds, always hovering near the top tables. Also took down quite a few of the top limited players in the country. Not too shabby for a deck built in under a minute! For the seventh and last round, my opponent asked for the win since I was guaranteed top eight status already. After some negotiation, he agreed to split his prizes with me after I conceded.\r\n\r\nSo my finish was a respectable 5-2, but with some pretty good wins and quite a number of packs taken home. Nacatl War-Pride is quite good in sealed (dunno in draft), it's practically a \"must-kill\" creature. Pyrohemia is a true bomb, as it turned the game around for me more than once.\r\n\r\nI love playing Limited Magic, much more so than Constructed, despite the fact it feels more expensive (I'm still not sure whether it actually\r\n   \r\n_\r\n    \r\nis\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n   \r\nmore expensive) Constructed Magic is fun, but I prefer not having to worry about metagames. Coming to a tournament bringing nothing but your deckbuilding and playing skills, opening your packs, building your deck and slugging it out &#8212; there's no better way to play Magic.",

And I brought up the topic of the noontime TV show Wowowee, which we had just seen about half an hour of before we got in the taxi.\r\n\r\nI told him that I thought of it as a really terrible show. Sure, poor people win relatively-large cash prizes and stuff from it, but it feels so exploitative. Hundreds, maybe thousands of poor folk from god-knows-how-far-away queue up outside the studios every day hoping to get into the studio audience to participate in the cash giveaways. There are probably people that see all these \"lucky\" scrubs earning free cash on TV, so that instead of spending their time looking for work or ways to earn a decent, continuous income, they stand around the ABS-CBN studios day in and day out hoping to get lucky. And hope they don't get caught in a stampede of course.\r\n\r\nAnd I wish someone would do a survey on how well the \"winners\" of these noontime shows (yeah, we also caught a bit of Eat Bulaga!) fare a few months after their windfall of cash. Methinks that giving out cash to poor families, while certainly good intent, is nowhere near enough to guarantee that they rise above their station. \"Teach a man to fish... \". Alongside their exploitative nature and promotion of cheap barbs and slapsticks, I doubt whether such shows actually have a net positive effect on society.\r\n\r\nNow Brian, as it were, has never been the most opinionated of my brothers. In fact, he's more of the laid-back type, seemingly not caring about what's going on in the world at large, so I was a bit surprised when we got into a discussion on the cheap lows that Philippine media has sunk to. Apparently he had caught a TV interview of \"Mr. Shoo-Li\" Jun Urbano that he really liked, where the old comedian compared the Philippines of yesterdays to our current dire straits. I was pleasantly surprised with the level of our discussion, and I said to myself: \"No matter how bad things get in our country, as long as we have kids that are able to think about things like this, we'll always have hope.\"\r\n\r\nIn short (and this may be obvious anyway), noontime shows are really bad and shockingly exploitative. Seriously, anyone who looks at these noontime shows with at least 1% of a critical eye would agree.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by yebah on 2007-05-07 11:35:17 +0000\r\nwow. that's pretty profound for something so lame-o. i actually watch eat bulaga over lunch and don't give much thought to it. if at all, i watch it for cindy kurleto and pauleen luna. the eb babes would've been cute but they dance horribly, and the sex bombs are only there every other day of the week.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2007-05-10 20:35:12 +0000\r\nYou caught me. I'm not actually the free-wheeling happy-go-lucky schmuck I pretend to be. I tend to overthink a lot of things, which means sometimes I'm\r\noverly critical. That being said, I only watched said shows because I was stuck in a room with people who were watching it. I'd never actually watch it on purpose, sexy girls or no. Something else that annoyed me: Some of the multiple-choice questions on Wowowee used to filter out contestants are actually kinda hard trivia questions, the sort where you have to be a bit familiar with the particular domain of the question to answer. It may seem like elitist thinking, but they weren't the type of questions you would expect the people who join these contests to be able to answer. It gives the show some pretense of being \"intellectual\" or maybe even \"educational\", when the contestants are obviously just randomly choosing which answer to pick.",

The format, Standard. I was playing Mike Flores' \"Legends of Team CMU\" -- the Mishra/Korlash aggro/control/combo deck that placed seventh in New Jersey Regionals, with a modified sideboard since I couldn't get all of the cards in time. Flores discusses the deck in detail here (requries a Premium SCG.com account)\r\n\r\nRound 1 0-2 Loss vs GUB NarcoBridge (Dregde combo)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 2 2-1 Win vs Mono-black Rack\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 3 1-2 Loss vs Mono-red Burn\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 4 2-0 Win vs White Weenie\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 5 0-2 Loss vs Dragonstorm\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 6 2-0 Win vs Rakdos\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 7 2-0 Win vs BW Rebel Control\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 8 2-0 Win vs Gruul\r\n\r\nSpecific game notes:\r\n\r\nRound 1: First game went long, eventually two large grave trolls and a svogthos managed to overwhelm the defense with 5 cards left in his library. I guess I should have mulliganned the 2nd game when I didn't have either a Crypt or the Leyline, as I died to 20+ zombies on turn 4.\r\n\r\nRound 2: Game 1, I went down to 1 he had four racks down and I had three cards in hand. Over the next few turns I brought him down to zero from eighteen while at that precarious state. www.down-to-one.com. Game 2 went fast for him, taking me out with fast discard. Game 3 sees him keep a one-lander. I transmute for Persecute and name black, obviously. Mishra and Korlash walk across and end the game.\r\n\r\nRound 3: This deck is very good against aggro. At least the normal Gruul aggro that has like 33% creatures and 33% burn. My opponent here was more like 50% burn. Four Tendrils simply can't keep up. His deck is an autoloss to Paladin en-Vec + Worship, but it has game over mine. I made a play mistake here in that while I was getting trounced in Game 2, I showed him Korlash (which didn't show in game 1) in a desperate move to stave off the loss. I lost anyway, and now knowing that I had the Korlash, he boarded in Dead/Gones to handle him in game 3. In the 3rd game, I actually had a naked Cloister on the board for four turns, hoping to draw a Tendrils -- I had not drawn any of the four yet at that point. I drew eight cards over four turns from a library of maybe forty cards and didn't see a single Tendrils. :(\r\n\r\nRound 4: He went first, playing Ication Javilineers. I yawned inside. Easy match. I was right.\r\n\r\nRound 5: We were 5 turns into game 1 and I hadn't seen any Lotus Blooms so I was thinking it was some sort of R/U counterburn, and held back on the Rise / Fall until I knew what was going on. Then I died. Game 2, I had the Rise / Fall on turn 2. But I was thinking, \"Gee, I don't wanna waste it and hit lands, I'll wait for him to play a couple more lands.\" Then I lost. Stupid, stupid, stupid play against what should have been a favorable matchup. In my defense, I was really tired and pissed-off at my 2-2 (now 2-3) record. Yeah, bad excuse. Must... stay... in... top... mental... form... (and think about adding Stupors to the board).\r\n\r\nRound 6: Most people need to read the Epochrasite when I play it, so I was surprised when the guy just went \"Ok\" after I played mine on turn 2. it turns out he had some of his own. He had a few Tombstalkers as well, but no Korlash in sight. Easy win once I got out a pair of Cloisters to stop the discard.\r\n\r\nRound 7: Blowout. Sorry if he reads this, but his deck isn't very good. I get to four Epochrasites early in the first game, then back it up with Arrows to take out the rebels. Game 2 was fun, with me at 2 life and no blockers, he swings with a Phyrexian Totem. Tendrils for 9. Ouch, your board is wiped.\r\n\r\nRound 8: Again, blowout. The matchup is pretty much as Flores describes it, block with Epoc during early turns, trade one of your legends for card advantage, then climb back quickly with either Korlash or Mishra.\r\n\r\nFinal record: 5-3, finishing 42nd. Despite my game win ratio, I had the worst tiebreaks of all 5-3s (since I climbed back from a 2-3 deficit). At least it was better than my disastrous 1-4-drop Regionals record last year \r\n   \r\n.\r\n\r\nRandom mistakes I made:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- Tapping Academy Ruins for mana when I should've used it to get back Chromatic Stars (Mishra was in play)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- Playing a Graven Cairns first turn when I had a shockland\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- Not being aggressive enough against Dragonstorm\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- Random boarding mistakes -- I need to keep better track of my sideboard.\r\n\r\nOn playing net decks: This was the first time I had brought to a tournament a deck that someone else built. Maybe I was growing up. :p Despite my love of being a rogue deckbuilder, I have to admit I haven't been really successful at it. I realize now that one way to get better is to play some well-designed decks that other people have built so I can learn from their design. I was already playing a Korlash deck prior to this, and had heard of variants that splash blue for various reasons. But I don't think I would have ever been able to think of this current design -- the deck is just crazy. It plays very solidly and randomly gets blowout draws. I will probably play it for at least one more tournament and hope that I actually play a lot better than I did today.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgevent/regionals07/edison\r\n [2]: http://www.starcitygames.com/php/news/article/14323.html\r",

My previous outing showed me a solid control matchup and maybe 60% aggro matchup. I tweaked the sideboard to improve the aggro game post-board, dropping the useless Yixlid Jailers for 4 Last Gasps.\r\n\r\nHere's how I did:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 1 2-0 win vs MGA\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 2 0-2 loss vs RUW control (no angels)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 3 2-0 win vs RGW mid-range aggro (elephants/avalanche riders)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 4 2-1 win vs RW Boros aggro\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 5 2-1 win vs RG Gruul aggro\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 6 1-2 loss vs GW aggro\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 7 0-2 loss vs RGW Zoo\r\n\r\nThe below stats are for both tournaments\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\ntotal wins: 21\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\ntotal losses: 13\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nwin% ratio (total): 61%\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nwins vs aggro: 15\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nlosses vs aggro: 10\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nwin% ratio vs aggro: 60%\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nwins vs control: 6\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nlosses vs control: 3\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nwin% ratio vs control: 67%\r\n\r\nObviously, I did a lot worse than the previous tournament, as all my percentages dropped. Probably due to the fact that I actually went to work before going to the tournament (which meant I had a lot less sleep... ), I made too many bad plays in the first two losses. There's an\r\n   \r\n[\r\n    \r\narticle today][3] \r\n   \r\non magicthegathering.com about how you should avoid racing aggro and avoid taking damage as much as possible... I think I basically violated every single principle in that article during those losing matches. Yes, even the lone control matchup -- I didn't kill a Hellkite thinking I would just race it with Korlash, but the Bust on his turn sealed my fate.\r\n\r\nThe GW aggro loss hurt -- I lost the last game because I was at three, he had a Saffi, all I had was a 9/9 Korlash with a Temporal Isolation on it and I didn't notice my opponent had a Vitu-ghazi and I thought I could survive one more turn with one life. If I had just taken out his Saffi with the Demonfire I had in hand instead of waiting to burn him to 0... I would have drawn a House Guard next turn, transmute for Tendrils, swing with Korlash, stack damage and cast Tendrils on Korlash for an 18-point life swing.\r\n\r\nThe round 6 loss really broke my spirit, I was in such a bad mental state that I played badly in the round 7 zoo matchup. Not that having perfectly tight play would have helped -- he had the zoo god draws both games, I was down to eight before I even had Damnation mana.\r\n\r\nLessons learned:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nNever, ever try to race with damage. I may have bigger beats, but I'm usually behind on life. I should always take out threats until I can stabilize with Tendrils.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI need to become mentally stronger, so that play mistakes from previous losses don't affect succeeding games.\r\n\r\nSeeing as how the local metagame is maybe 60-70% aggro, I'll also probably tweak the deck to make the maindeck stronger against aggro and move some of the control hate to the board.\r\n\r\nNext stop: Regionals.\r\n\r\n [1]: #\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/blog/2007/05/future-sight-inaugural-ng-galleria-26-may-2007/\r",

(Registration required.) I list my results here for my future reference.\r\n\r\n_\r\n  \r\nYour Top Strength: Judgment, critical thinking, and open-mindedness\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n  \r\nThinking things through and examining them from all sides are important aspects of who you are. You do not jump to conclusions, and you rely only on solid evidence to make your decisions. You are able to change your mind.\r\n\r\n_Your Second Strength: Creativity, ingenuity, and originality\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n  \r\nThinking of new ways to do things is a crucial part of who you are. You are never content with doing something the conventional way if a better way is possible.\r\n\r\n_Your Third Strength: Fairness, equity, and justice\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n  \r\nTreating all people fairly is one of your abiding principles. You do not let your personal feelings bias your decisions about other people. You give everyone a chance.\r\n\r\n_Your Fourth Strength: Forgiveness and mercy\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n  \r\nYou forgive those who have done you wrong. You always give people a second chance. Your guiding principle is mercy and not revenge.\r\n\r\n_Your Fifth Strength: Bravery and valor\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n  \r\nYou are a courageous person who does not shrink from threat, challenge, difficulty, or pain. You speak up for what is right even if there is opposition. You act on your convictions.\r\n\r\nI'm amused by how the first and second strengths are a bit in opposite directions. Same for the third and fourth. I'm a living contradiction.\r\n\r\nVia\r\n  \r\nChief Happiness Officer\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.authentichappiness.sas.upenn.edu\r",

There were several other people there waiting for taxis but she had been there first. She finally managed to hail a cab and had already gotten in the back seat when an MMDA traffic guy [1] stopped her and told her that he had hailed that taxi for two women nearby that he pointed to. C said she was the one who had hailed the taxi, but the traffic guy politely but firmly insisted that she get out of the car. Indignant, C took note of the traffic guy's name plate and went on her way.\r\n\r\nAs soon as she got to the office, C composed a letter of complaint to the MMDA director and faxed it to their office as soon as she was able. Having coursed her complaint through several different offices, it was promptly handled and a hearing with the traffic guy was scheduled during the next week.\r\n\r\nC and I talked about it several times during the week before her hearing. She had asked me before sending the complaint whether it was a good idea or not, or if she should just let the incident go. I said no, she should proceed with her complaint. The traffic guy was clearly in the wrong, and she at least deserved an explanation regarding whether or not MMDA traffic guys are allowed to hassle people who are getting into taxis. Some people were worried that the traffic guy might be vindictive and might try to get back at her in some way. C is a pretty strong and brave woman though, and she wouldn't back down even if that was a likely possibility. What did concern her was whether her complaint might cause someone to lose their job. I told her not to worry, at worst he'll be asked to apologize and explain, and that will be that.\r\n\r\nThe day of the hearing arrived, I wanted to go with her to the MMDA office since I was curious how things would proceed, but I had a meeting an hour or so afterwards and I didn't want to risk being late, and besides she already had her boyfriend with her for support. I'm told that the traffic guy made some lame excuse that there was some sort of emergency and that's why the two women needed the taxi. But he apologized to C anyway and promised to be more circumspect in the future. C got a written apology and came away satisfied, having fought city hall and won, sort of.\r\n\r\nShe asked me if I think she wasted her time. I told her that what she did was a good thing; every so often someone has to complain against people who may or may not be abusing their position, if only to keep such people honest. And she got to witness firsthand how the government handles things, if ever she gets into a more serious situation with the government later on, she has this experience to draw upon.\r\n\r\nMy take? I'm guessing the two women were friends/acquaintances of the traffic guy and they were impatient to get a cab. In true macho Filipino fashion, traffic guy offers to help them out. And that would have been fine, really. That is, until he started harassing another commuter to get it done.\r\n\r\nI'm glad I wasn't there at the hearing though. If I had heard that lame excuse I might have done my best Phoenix Wright impression and shout \"Objection!\"\r\n\r\n[1] I'm not sure whether they're called \"officers\" or not.",

The first one with the Mishra deck (Flores' Legends of Team CMU) to a disappointing 4-3 finish in a sea of Angelfire, Solar Flare and Gruul. Disappointed with the decks performance, I took a look at the result of Australian Nationals that same weekend, and decided to play the Rakdos \"Satanic Sligh\" build that had won that event in today's qualifier, which was incidentally the last one I could play given my schedule.\r\n\r\nI guess I wasn't the only one thinking that, as of course I failed to predict how th metagame would shift. There were a lot more burn decks this time around, and my first two matches were among them. I split the first two for a disappointing start, then lost rounds four and five in quick succession. Frustrated at my inability to play the format and the terrible 2-3 record, I ticked \"Drop\" in the Result Slip and went home quite a bit sleepy.\r\n\r\nSo ends this year's quest for Nationals. Again, just to reiterate: I suck at Standard.\r\n\r\nI'm terrible at guessing what decks are doing (I failed to predict that my round four opponent would Resurrect an Akroma, thinking that only Solar Flare decks did that and not Angelfire... ), I'm terrible at predicting the metagame (I had Martyrs of Ashes in my sideboard that should have been Bottle Gnomes for the burn mirror) and I make really disastrous play errors (I suspended Rift Bolt instead of hardcasting with my monored opponent at five... allowing him to Char me at EOT and burn again during his turn to take the game)\r\n\r\nI need more solid constructed finishes to boost my ratings so I could be in the top 75 next year (and not have to grind it out in the qualifiers again). Sadly, my best constructed finish this year was actually\r\n   \r\nin Block \r\n   \r\n.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I need a break. Ravnica block is pretty much dead to me now, I will probably take a hiatus until it rotates out. With the possible exception of another PTQ for Valencia, I expect my next tournament to be the Lorwyn prereleases.\r\n\r",

Helluva lot of people there, more than I was expecting for a Core Set Release tournament.\r\n\r\nThe format is, as usual, Sealed Deck with four rounds of Swiss pairings. Players were grouped in Flights of 32 people each (previous prerelease tournaments had 48-people flights), each win gets you an Xth booster pack and the top 2 of each flight (the ones who went 4-0) get something extra. Apparently the extra prizes were stuff like a bag, a shirt and a big (cardboard) Kamahl card box. I of course got the crappy box.\r\n\r\nYes, I went 4-0. I'm not too surprised. Since a release tournament is more \"casual\", the competition is not very fierce. Usually things get tricky in the last two rounds. Anyway, I won all 4 rounds, not even giving up a game loss. My sealed pool was awesome, lots of removal and acceleration. Beacon of Destruction and Mobilization are bomb rares, with Cone of Flame and Overrun as bomb uncommons. Awesome deck, good on tempo and usually giving quick wins (gave me time for lunch)\r\n\r\nAfter the Sealed portion (and assembling my crappy box), I was in a fighting mood so I signed up for an 8-man draft. This was more serious competition, and the prize for the top 2 places was an additional promo foil Reya Dawnbringer (and a couple of packs). I won the first match 2-0, got my first game loss in game one of match 2 won two games in a row to make the top 2. Yay!\r\n\r\nThe art for Reya Dawnbringer is quite the awesomeness.\r\n\r\nFinal record: 6-0-1 matches for the day. 12-1 games. Not bad at all. My plan of going to work for 3 hours before tournaments to increase my mental strength is working!\r\n\r\nNext: Nationals Qualifiers\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/events/07gameday&dcmp=ILC-MTGRGNW2\r",

I was still too stupid to know I should leave an island open when playing a Shapeshifter face down.\r\n\r\nFor the quarterfinals loss, I couldn't think fo any play mistakes. However, my sideboard was stupid. All I could bring in were some Penumbra Spiders. I have some ideas for sideboard changes should I be able to play Block again.\r\n\r\nThe deck is solid, with game against both aggro and control. My decklist is here. It's actually a modification of the Top 8 Shifters deck from GP Montreal. I didn't have any Vensers, so I tossed in random stuff like Psionic Blasts and Call of the Herds.\r\n\r\nCard-specific notes:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- Thelonite Hermit is pretty awesome, allowing you to win out of nowhere with 8 additional surprise damagae (24 if you have a shifter)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- Vesuvan Shapeshifter + Llanowar Reborn is awesome tech. A grafted shifter beats most other things in combat. I've been able to take down Calciderms and Spectral Forces without losing my shifter\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- Llanowar Reborn may be the best or 2nd best of the uncommon FS lands.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- Willbender is awesome in the GW Goyf matchup -- mostly because their removal (Temporal Isolation/Bound in Silence) is so effective on their own creatures. And their Griffin Guide is so nice on mine.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-- Draining Whelk is stupid here. I think it should be in the board, coming in against RG mana ramp decks.\r\n\r\nAnyway, yeah I scrubbed out in the quarterfinals. At that point I was really tired and just wanted to go home. My deck also annoyed me in the last game. I cast all 3 foresees trying to find and answer to an 8/9 flying Tarmagoyf but I didn't find any. I picked up my prize for the top eight finish (seven packs)... I was a bit disappointed as well since I fought through so many rounds and only got seven packs, I was hoping maybe 10-12. Well, I've never had a top 8 finish before so maybe I was expecting more stuff :p\r\n\r\nOn my way home I was thinking about quitting Magic. I started to play \"seriously\" about a year ago, and all I have to show for it so far was a PTQ top 8. Playing Magic is so fucking hard. Let me rephrase: playing Magic is easy. Being good at Magic is so fucking hard. You need to pay attention to everything, you need to have the best deck, you need to know how to sideboard in all the matchups. At some point it stops being fun.\r\n\r\nIt's going to become harder since most of the guys I grew up playing the game with are either no longer playing or out of the country. And I'm too cheap to pay for more stuff on MTGO. Many of the Magic players in the office have migrated to playing WoW CCG.\r\n\r\nAm I going to quit? Am I burned out?\r\n\r\nNah, that was just the tiredness talking. Magic is fun, despite the competitive pressure. I just need to be able to reconcile two things:\r\n   \r\n**\r\n    \r\nI have to be the best\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nand\r\n   \r\n**\r\n    \r\nI can't lose sight of the fun.\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n.\r\n\r\nLuckily, it's fun to win, so that makes it a bit easier. It's fun to have a face-down Willbender in play when your opponent's Ancestral Vision is about to resolve. It's fun to beat down using your opponent's Griffin Guides. It's fun to come back from one life to win the game. It's fun to win, and it's also fun to play. And playing against some of the best players in the country, I'm almost there. Am I good enough yet? We'll see soon enough... \r\n\r\nEdit: Oh noes!

        "content": "---\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2007-07-28 20:50:33\r\ntags:\r\nSoftware Development\r\ntitle: Rich Internet Applications\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2007/07/rich-internet-applications/\r\n---\r\n\r\nMost of the time, my work involves mostly run-of-the-mill information management systems. Lately however, I've been asked to look into some new tech, and that got me interested in what's called Rich Internet Applications (RIAs for short). The primary platform for RIAs is Flash, which apparently is already owned by Adobe and Macromedia is no more. Yeah, I never really paid attention to Flash, like most people I assumed it was only for making amusing movies and annoying ads. Also, Flash has always been a tool oriented towards people who are more design-oriented, not engineers or programmers like me. I mean, I load up Flash 8 and I have no idea how to do anything.\r\n\r\nLately however, Adobe has released a product called Flex, which is basically a programming API for generating SWF files using XML and the Flash scripting language, ActionScript. It's pretty cool, and I've seen a few really nice demos of web applications done using Flash, some of which I highlighted in recent links. I've tried out Flex for a few days, and really it is SO AWESOME. There are some UI stuff that you can do that would be ridiculously difficult with traditional HTML/Javascript and those things are so easy using Flex. (Just one caveat: some of the demos I've seen so far are quite the resource hogs... )\r\n\r\nThe real power of Flex is the fact that it generates files that run on Flash Player, one of the most ubiquitous platforms on the web. I'm betting that Flash Player has a larger install base than Internet Explorer. So it's really hard to compete with Flash as a web platform.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't stop people from trying however. Lately, Microsoft announced Silverlight, a .NET-based RIA SDK of some sort. The screenshots seem to denote that it can do really cool things as well.

At home I just go down to the kitchen and check the ref or the cupboards. At the office, there's always the pantry or those people you know that usually store some snacks. If I need something, I can get it fairly easily. This is something of an abundance situation.\r\n\r\nBy contrast, for the two weeks I was in HK, I had no snacks. None at all. I literally ate only three meals a day and nothing more. Sometimes less. If I got hungry while staying at the hostel, it would be too troublesome to go out and buy some snacks. Breakfast would usually be just some bread that we'd buy at a bakeshop on the way to work. Dinner would be whatever fastfood we decided to eat at that day. There's something of a scarcity mentality.\r\n\r\nObviously, I was able to survive just fine without snacks for two weeks, so why don't I do that? Somehow I think eating more makes me more sleepy during the day, so i would benefit my productivity. I suppose that the abundance mentality makes me eat more even though I don't need it.

I've been thinking of starting a true-blue personal software project for a while now, and the idea of PyMTG appeals to me for several reasons:\r\n\r\n(a) It's related to one of my current hobbies\r\n   \r\n(b) Allows me to become familiar with a new language (Python)\r\n   \r\n(c) It's moderately to insanely difficult (depending on how well I set my targets), i.e. it's of a scale large enough to be challenging.\r\n\r\nThe wiki page contains the target features for the first release at the end of the year. Quite modest I think, despite my tendencies to underestimate. I hope I can follow through with this project and have enough time for it.\r\n\r\nThe success of the project would be determined by how much of the existing MTG cardbase it could support. Ultimately, I would want it to be open-source and have people help me to obtain 100% cardbase support. But that's obviously very far away.\r\n\r\nWish me luck 🙂\r\n\r\nUpdate: This project is on-hold, not surprisingly. It turns out I don't actually have time to learn a new language. :(\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.roytang.net/wiki/index.php/PyMTG\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Hannes Foulds on 2007-08-24 15:21:57 +0000\r\nI am attempting something very similar -- writing a game engine for Magic: The\r\n  \r\nGatering in .NET 2.0 with C#.\r\n\r\nMy project has been dorment for a while do to a demanding project at work, but\r\n  \r\nI think an evendour like this is very worthwile.\r\n\r\nDon't give up on the project, and try and keep us updated of the progress 😉",

This is only my third time here of course, and I've spent less than five weeks here in total since 2004. Still I find that certain things like ordering at restaurants and riding the MTR have started to become a bit more \"normal\" for me.\r\n\r\nOriginally when I was told that I would be staying in HK for two weeks, I was a bit depressed, as I didn't really enjoy the prolonged stay last time. Hong Kong is not a particularly exciting place for me as I'm not the sort of person who totally enjoys being either a tourist or a shopper, which are the usual reasons why people come to HK. I'm not planning to go to Disneyland or Ocean Park so when people ask what I plan to do during the weekend I just tell them the truth: I have no plans. Probably bum around.\r\n\r\nThe trip is more pleasant this time around, as I'm really at the starting end of a project and things are not so busy. Also, the place we are staying at now has free high-speed wi-fi internet connection, and I was able to borrow a laptop for my use during weekends, so I can goof off on the internet whenever I get bored. In times like these I really consider buying a laptop. Although, traveling once a year is not really a good reason to get one.\r\n\r\nAt the place we have been working at, there's this guy who speaks English in a way that is so obviously Filipino. Every country has it's own unique accent of English I suppose, so it's immediately obvious when someone is speaking English in a manner that you can easily grok.\r\n\r\nAs I type this, mentally I hear myself saying it with a Chinese accent, as is my tendency when hanging around people with strange accents too long. Probably my grasp of good English grammar is suffering a bit as well.\r\n\r\nThis was a random rant, thanks.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by noems on 2007-08-10 17:45:05 +0000\r\nhey! nasa hongkong ka pa ba? if you're not after the parks and the shopping\r\n  \r\n(specifically for clothes) edi go shopping for toys! 🙂\r\n\r\nhanap ka nung dyecast (tama ba?) initial D na cars or transformers! or, kung\r\n  \r\nayaw mo bumili for you...  bili ka for me at babayaran na lang kita. hehehe\r\n\r\nwent to HK last year 3 days work, another 2 days for leisure. i spent one\r\n  \r\nwhole day in disneyland and 1 whole day in Ocean Park. bad trip lang cause it\r\n  \r\nwas summer time, kaya grabe ang init sa park. ang hindi namin na visit, ung\r\n  \r\nmga toy stores. 🙂",

I got a copy of six of the books from an officemate a couple of months back, and I've just finished the seventh book today. I don't usually go through books that quickly, so it's a sign that I've really enjoyed this series. (If I don't enjoy a series, I typically lose interest before even finishing the book -- I have a copy of Sword of Shannara around here to prove that.)\r\n\r\nThe books are more-or-less sci-fi, the first book Ender's Game taking place in a \"near future\" setting, where brilliant children are raised to help fight a war against an invading alien species. The later books branch from the original, with the Speaker for the Dead arc leaning towards philosophical meanings of life in outer space, while the Shadow series of books focus more on political and strategic stuff on Earth.\r\n\r\nIn the Speaker for the Dead branch (Speaker for the Dead, Xenocide, Children of the Mind), Card's characters are usually placed in a series of moral and ethical dilemmas presented by the various sci-fi elements presented: metaphysical discoveries, sentient alien races, etc. The reader is really drawn in to the character's situations, making the books quite the page turner.\r\n\r\nThe Shadow branch (Ender's Shadow, Shadow of the Hegemon, Shadow Puppets, and I have yet to read Shadow Giants) focuses less on the moral decisions, but more of political or military-related issues in a world divided after the defeat of the alien invaders. The story focuses on what happens to Ender's companions after they return to Earth, and seem to be leading up to how Ender's brother Peter eventually became the leader of the world. It's a bit disappointing that Peter is so stupid in Shadow Puppets though, I hope he's better in the next book.\r\n\r\nThe series is awesome overall, and I look forward to the continuation; supposedly Card is writing a sequel that will tie both branches together.\r\n\r",

It was definitely... different than the usual weekend tournaments. I mean people playing Rhox different. Asking whether equip costs needed to be paid every turn different. Not that I'm picking on noobs or anything; it was all fun and refreshing. Everything was a lot more casual than the highly competitive PTQs or GPTs.\r\n\r\nI brought the Rakdos deck of course, seeing as how that was the only standard deck I had built for weeks now. I lost the first round to another burn deck (lost the race), but won the next 3 rounds to finish 3-1. Of course my tiebreaks were terrible, so I ended up fifth and winning only one booster pack. FNM is fun, but I don't know if I would do it again though.\r\n\r\nOne thing I love is my awesomeness at die rolls. In the last round, my opponent rolled a 20. I frowned at it; I hadn't won a die roll all day. I said, \"kaya ko yan\" (I can beat this) and rolled. Of course, I got a 20, then proceeded to win the tiebreak roll, and eventually won the match by having two Dark Confidants on the board flipping lands for two turns in succession. Better lucky than good, but my opponent must have been really frustrated.",

Obviously, the black was too strong to be just a small splash as I wanted. Maybe green should have been the splash? I often ended up boarding +2 swamp +1 sudden death +1 dark withering -2 forest -1 citanul woodreaders -1 thallid germinator. I really like that sliver linear I had going.\r\n\r\nFirst round was against a guy playing UGR, he had Call of the Herd which was annoying. He had in both games one and three, and I practically lost to it. Game two I won the back of turn two Gemhide, turn three Bonesplitter and he missed the third land drop.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 1: 1-2 loss vs UGR Call of the Herd\r\n\r\nSecond round was against a famous local player who won a very big tourney recently (yeah, I try to avoid mentioning names). We were playing the same colors, but I had more removal (obviously). I even had to kill a clockwork hydra twice in two turns. I won in two. This guy eventually made top eight though.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 2: 2-0 win vs BGR\r\n\r\nThird round was against a teachings deck. He had a lot of fun instants to teach for -- Dead / Gone, Piracy Charm, Cancel. And Mystic Speculation gave him a way to find the cards he really needed. He stabilized early in game one and won. In game two, I was at 5, he had three creatures (Bogardan Rager, the blue Harrow spellshaper and Firefright Mage) on the board, and had cast Mystic Speculation three times during his turn, so there was a good chance he had what he needed to take me down. He was at 15, I took something like 5-10 minutes with two-headed sliver, sedge sliver, a morph (Gathan Raiders, I have 1 card in hand) and 4 kobolds, computing if I had enough to kill him with Tromp. I knew he had a dead/gone in hand (he tutored for it) and had 3 mana open. I cast Tromp. It resolves. He'll probably bounce the Sedge, that leaves me with a total of 22 damage versus 7 toughness on the board -- just enough to kill. I swing. He blocks. I unmorph the raiders. He counts, then counts again, then shuffles up for game 3. Game three was a heartbreaker -- I had aggro'd him down to 2 before he stabilized, and I had around three turns to draw the Orcish Cannonade that would end the game, but I didn't. I tried playing the Scourge to finish him, but he had the Cancel.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 3: 1-2 loss vs RU Teachings\r\n\r\nNot a good start in a six-round tournament. :/\r\n\r\nRound four was against a guy I was sitting with during deck construction. I knew his deck had a ton of removal, but I also knew he had a vulnerable land mix. So I just had to aggro early to win. I don't remember the details, but I lost game 1 and my game 2 notes show I took him down from seventeen in one swing O_o\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 4: 2-1 win vs RB control\r\n\r\nRound five against green/red. Game one I'm about to win so I try to Death Rattle a Baloth. I realize it won't work though, and hold off. But my opponent calls a judge on me. The judge rules that I need to choose another legal target, the only one being my own Sedge Sliver. I believe that this is an incorrect ruling and to avoid it, I will always declare my targets first before paying costs next time. I shrug and set it aside, and he stabilizes and I lose the game. I'm a bit ticked off of course, and he loses the next two games to my merciless aggro.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 5: 2-1 win vs RG\r\n\r\nI'm number ten! A win brings me into the top eight.\r\n\r\nRound six vs an old-time Magic player. He's always around at tournaments and generally a nice guy. His deck is black/red and chock-full of removal, creatures basically don't stay long on our board. I lose game one, no obvious misplays. Game two, I'm ahead on racing, but then he drops a Kaervek the Merciless! All I have in hand is a Dark Withering... but that can't touch Kaervek. I draw a Dustwasp and take the five damage, going down to four, hoping the flyer will be enough to raise him. Next turn he Dread Returns an Emberwilde Augur and plays another creature. I can't race those guys, so I just pass the turn. During his upkeep, he tosses the Goblin at me and shows the Ghostfire. GG.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI shake his hand and wish him luck.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 6: 2-0 loss vs BR\r\n\r\nI finish 16th, winning 3 PLC packs, of course with nothing spectacular in them. That was my last chance to win Tarmogoyfs :/\r\n\r\nOh well, next: Lorwyn.\r\n\r",

Good ol' Dark Confidant even dealt me 20 damage in one game. I think I had the Hit/Run + Dark Confidant thing happen to me twice. Anyway, after an additional rounds 6 loss to MGA, I just packed it in and went home to sleep.\r\n\r\nBut this report is not about that disaster at the Philippine Open, this is about a tournament I actually believed I was better suited for. GPT Bangkok -- the format is Time Spiral block Sealed Deck. Since Invasion Block, I've always been more of a casual limited player (isn't that weird?), opening boxes and playing drafts with some friends in a casual atmosphere usually punctuated by random late-night trips to Wendy's. And I've always loved Sealed Deck, because it's a lot more \"casual\" than draft where in addition to the usual skill-testers of deck construction and actual gameplay, there's the added pressure of having to choose what cards will be in your pool! Sealed deck is nice and easy. I heard one player remark that Sealed Deck is more luck than skill, since how well you perform largely depends on what bombs you open. That's more or less true, but I've developed a special ability I like to call \"the ability to win without bombs.\"\r\n\r\nI came to the tournament with my usual lack of sleep and a bit of a cold, which would only get worse as the day worsened. My sealed deck:\r\n\r\n8 Islands\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n8 Swamp\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Mountain\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Blind Phantasm\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Skulking Knight\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Veiling Oddity\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Cyclopean Giant\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Errant Ephemeron\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Spiketail Drakeling\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Shadowmage Infiltrator\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Stormcloud Djinn\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Bog Serpent\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Corpulent Corpse\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Muck Drubb\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Dunerider Outlaw\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Merfolk Thaumaturgist\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Viscerid Deepwalker\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Dream Stalker\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Mystical Teachings\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Second Wind\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Think Twice\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Midnight Charm\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Haunting Hymn\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Strangling Soot\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Death Rattle\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Tendrils of Corruption\r\n\r\nRelevant sideboard cards:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Swamp\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Sudden Shock\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Saltcrusted Steppes\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Molder\r\n\r\nIt was really stupid to have Sudden Shock in the board instead of the main, but what can I say? I missed it, and I really should have gone eighteen lands, as I knew well and good that missing the 3rd land drop was akin to death in this format. Every game, I boarded in +1 Sudden Shock +1 Swamp for -1 Merfolk Thaumaturgist, -1 Dunerider Outlaw. I was so used to it that in one game where my opponent was at one life, I cast Teachings hoping to finish him off with the Sudden Shock, only to realize it was still game one and the burn spell was still in the board.\r\n\r\nRound one I'm paired with one of the few female players in the local Magic community, sporting a black/red deck. Game one, she only has a Keldon Halberdier suspended on turn 2 and nothing else. I hit my drops, use the Midnight Charm on the Halberdier and take the game easily. She dominates a long game two with a Sengir Nosferatu. I decide to save the Sudden Shock for that bat. Time is called for game 3, but by then I've already stripped her hand with a backbreaking Haunting Hymn for four and I have dominating fliers on the board, and I win on turn 3 of extra time.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 1: 2-1 win vs BR Sengir Nosferatu (yeah, I name decks by their bombs)\r\n\r\nRound 2, my opponent was red/white and his bomb was Angel of Salvation (everyone has a bomb except me). Game 1 is me going \"Haunting Hymn for the win!\" Game 2 I see his bomb for the first time and proceed to get squashed by it. Game 3, I manage to off the Angel, having just enough swamps to Tendrils for five (including a Swamp created by the Cyclopean Giant) I squeak off a win in game 3 after we were both in topdeck mode and I drew a flier.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 2: 2-1 win vs RW Angel of Salvation\r\n\r\nRound 3 is versus a guy with what appears to be a four color deck. His deck is solid, but he played a friend of mine in the previous round, so I know what his bomb is -- Oros the Avenger. I win game one on the back of Haunting Hymn again, and game 2Oros makes his first appearance. I was prepared though, and immediately locked him down with Second Wind. I'm on the defensive end for a bit, but I pull out the win eventually.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 3: 2-0 win vs BRUw Oros the Avenger\r\n\r\nBy this time, my cold is starting to get really bad and I seriously need to get more tissues. The airconditioned mall is also badly affecting my health despite the large crowd. My round 4 opponent is one of the higher-ranked limted players in the country. I've played against him several times before and have never won. Game one we got into some confusion as to who actually played or drew. He said he'd draw, but proceeded to lay a Plains before my first turn. I shrugged and just let it go, which was a mistake. Now that I think about, he probably effectively played and drew in that game. By game two, I'm wondering if he thinks all my nose-wiping with my hand towel is really icky. Anyway, I lost to his bomb in two games -- Sacred Mesa. I have no answer in my colors, but I listed the Saltcrusted Steppes and the Molder in my sideboard because I wonder if I should have just boarder an off-color answer?\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 4: 0-2 loss vs GW Sacred Mesa\r\n\r\nI finished early so I wander around for a while. One of the local judges, apparently bored, has been trying to figure out how to make an origami paper crane, to no avail. We laugh a bit as his badly-mangled piece of paper. Another player tries to help but frankly, I think his attempts are closer to making a Vampire Bat than a crane, lol.\r\n\r\nRound five and I'm at 3-1. Need two more wins for shot at top eight. I play against a red-green deck, and my Infiltrator goes the distance in both games, carrying me to victory. Wheneverhe finally draws an answer to the Infiltrator (usually an Assassinate) he smacks it down hard in annoyance. Sorry man, them's the breaks. I knew from watching previous rounds that his bomb was Sprout Swarm, but it never came up.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 5: 2-0 win vs RGB Sprout Swarm\r\n\r\nAfter the match, I notice the judge who was previously doing the paper crane on our table, this time trying to build a card castle from basic lands. He must be really bored. Apparently the head judge challenged him to do it. Out of frustration, he gets some scotch tape and starts using it while the head judge isn't looking. Sadly, he can't get a tall enough castle stable even while cheating.\r\n\r\nBefore round six, standings are posted, which means the tournament is actually only six rounds instead of the seven I assumed. The standings put me at #4, and I'm paired with the #2 guy. We ID into the top 8.\r\n\r\nYay! My first GPT top 8. Top eight draft starts and it's my first time drafting TPF irl. And now my weakness is revealed to the Magic community: I completely suck at physically opening boosters. I need to borrow a pair of scissors from the judges table. Obviously, I'm stupid at drafting, and the guy to my left doesn't have time to play so he's just rare drafting. Despite my newbness (and trying hard not to be a Nosy Goblin), I manage to scrounge together a servicable G/R draft deck (Too lazy to list it here)\r\n\r\nRound seven starts and I'm paired against a local player/judge. Game one, I start off slow, but a Herd Gnarr powered by some Cyclical Evolution eventually drops him to six. He goes all in with his creatures next turn, dropping me to five and leaving only a Watcher Sliver to block. I topdeck into my third forest and play the Groundbreaker in my hand, going in for ten points of damage, six of it trample. He has no outs, so we shuffle up for game two. At this point, one of the judges stops the match and informs my opponent that his registered deck is only 35 cards. That's a game loss, so I immediately win the round. I feel really bad about this win -- the reason my opponent had misregistered is that the judge saw that I had finished registering early (I always finish early) and was rushing my opponent so the match could be started. I guess it wasn't my fault but still, not a fun way to win.\r\n\r\nTop four, everyone agrees to split the prize packs. That would give me half a box of Future Sight -- not bad for a day's work... er, play. The remaining matches need to be played out to see who gets the 3 byes to GP Bangkok. Since (a) I'm a nice guy and (b) I'm not likely to go to Bangkok just to scrub out and (c) I really wasn't feeling very well at that point and wanted to go home, I just accepted the half a box and scooped to my top four opponent.\r\n\r\nThis is still my best finish ever, and it follows the historical trend -- I've still never won more than five matches in a tournament. Still, it felt good to place well, especially after my recent string of bad Constructed performances. There are more GPTs this month, but they're on Sundays, and I don't like playing on Sundays, so probably I will try my luck again in Constructed until Lorwyn prereleases roll around.",

Each planeswalker is rare and has 3 abilities: a normal attack, a special move, and a finishing move.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nAjani Goldmane\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n   \r\n2ww\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nPlaneswalker -- Ajani\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n+1: You gain 2 life\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-1: Put a +1/+1 counter on each creature you control. Those creatures gain vigilance until end of turn.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-6: Put a white Avatar creature token into play with \"This creature's power and toughness are each equal to your life total.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nLoyalty: 4\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nMy take:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nUnlike every other planeswalker, resolving Ajani's \"finishing move\" does not guarantee a win in a Limited game. More likely, it's going to die to a common like Oblivion Ring. However, Ajani is still pretty good in limited, due to that very nice special move: you play her on turn 4 with 2-3 creatures on the board, pump them once, then swing. Next turn, play another creature or so, pump, swing. Sooner or later, all your guys are bigger than his guys. Also, if you're dying to some stupid 1/1 evasion guy, just gain 2 life a turn. Constructed application: A finisher and support life gain in Martyr-based decks. If you use Sacred Mesa, her special ability even becomes useful!\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nJace Beleren\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n   \r\n1UU\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nPlaneswalker -- Jace\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n+2: Each player draws a card.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-1: Target player draws a card.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-10: Target player puts the top twenty cards of his or her library into his or her graveyard.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nLoyalty: 3\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nMy take:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nCosting 1UU is useless for Jace, as you will almost never play him on the third turn. More likely you would play him on a later turn, with counter back-up. A simple Constructed application would be to use his special move 3 times, but that's just a bad Harmonize. The other two abilities require you to build your deck around them -- you're not going to use that finisher unless you're actually a mill deck, and the normal ability smells of Owling Mine to me. In limited, just build a defensive deck around him and keep pumping up loyalty. Resolving the finishing move will surely win you the game.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nLiliana Vess\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n   \r\n3BB\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nPlaneswalker -- Liliana\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n+1: Target player discards a card.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-2: Search your library for a card, then shuffle your library and put that card on top of it.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-8: Put all creature cards in all graveyards into play under your control.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nLoyalty: 5\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nMy take:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nAh, Liliana, first among equals. Well, first to be previewed anyway. The finisher will win you games in Limited -- but only after much blood has already been spilled. The special move on the other hand, pulls out all your other bombs from your deck (hope you had a few!) The normal move is meh in both Limited and Constructed -- paying 5 for a repeating single discard effect isn't really that good. For Constructed, her finisher has a strange synergy with Jace Beleren's... populate the graveyards, then animate 'em all under my control. Well, it's pretty good with Damnation as well. A bit of a \"win more\" card, if you live long enough to get Liliana online, you're probably a control deck and you're already winning.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nChandra Nalaar\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n   \r\n3RR\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nPlaneswalker -- Chandra\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n+1: Chandra Nalaar deals 1 damage to target player.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-X: Chandra Nalaar deals X damage to target creature.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-8: Chandra Nalaar deals 10 damage to target player and each creature he or she controls.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nLoyalty: 6\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nMy take:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nChandra's card looks awesome, let me get that out of the way. People will collect her just for that. That 6 loyalty there is really good as well. Slam this down in limited and make sure you can defend her for two turns = you win the game. Or, in more dire times, just take down a 6/6 guy for five mana. In Constructed, I'm not sure what deck would take her, as burn doesn't seem to be very strong in Lorwyn.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nGarruk Wildspeaker\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n   \r\n2GG\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nPlaneswalker -- Garruk\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n+1: Untap two target lands.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-1: Put a 3/3 green Beast creature token into play.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n-4: Creatures you control get +3/+3 and trample until end of turn.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nLoyalty: 3\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nMy take:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nMy favorite is the green one of course. Garruk compares favorably with Call of the Herd. Play him, and immediately make a 3/3 to defend him. If he takes an Incinerate, that's fine, you still have the token you made. If not... wow, more free Beasts! I'd use him this way in either Limited or Constructed. In fact, I can build a green deck just starting with 4 Call of the Herd 4 Garruk Wildspeaker... that's at least 20 creatures right there. Another application would be to use the normal move to accelerate into early 6-7 casting cost threats, butI like 3/3s better. The finisher is decent, and pretty good in Limited. It has a disadvantage over an actual Overrun in that your opponent can see it coming, but if you're planning to use it then you're probably winning anyway; in a defensive board the 3/3 beast is a better idea.\r\n\r",

A lot of people seemed to be playing blue or green stuff. There are people saying Needle Drop is good, what? Just because it cantrips?\r\n\r\nMy flight manages to start around 4 PM, and I open the sealed pool I'm registering. The first two rares I see are Jace Beleren and Chandra Nalar! Holy crap! It means of course, that I have to pass this pool. (That always happens when I get really good bombs) Anyway, I get a decent pool as well, with Austere Command (Wrath of God!), a foil Cryptic Command (not that I'd play it), and lots of removal. I ended up with the following WRb deck:\r\n\r\n1 Goldmeadow Harrier\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Cenn's Heir\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Avian Changeling\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Knight of Meadowgrain\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Springjack Knight\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Kithkin Harbinger\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Kinsbaile Balloonist\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 Plover Knights\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Shriekmaw\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Fire-Belly Changeling\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Thundercloud Shaman\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Hearthcage Giant\r\n\r\n1 Tarfire\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Nameless Inversion\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Eyeblight's Ending\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Surge of Thoughtweft\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Neck Snap\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Austere Command\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Wanderer's Twig\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Runed Stalactite\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Moonglove Extract\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Giant's Ire\r\n\r\n1 Ancient Ampitheatre\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Vivid Marsh\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n8 Plains\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n6 Mountains\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1 Swamp\r\n\r\nI went 3-1 with this sealed deck, a bit disappointed too coz I thought the pool was really good (I had a Wrath! Well, the Thundercloud Shaman also acted like a one-sided Wrath at one point) I lost to a blue black deck where I just kept getting dead land draws. One turn from losing to two black creatures with me having only one non-black blocker, I said, \"I have so much removal in this deck, surely I will draw one now.\" And I did, I got Shriekmaw. :/ I'm always disappointed when I get my loss in a Pre-release, I haven't won a pre-release shirt since Time Spiral!\r\n\r\nAnyway, the set is fun, the tribal implementation seems really good. (Not sure how it compares to Onslaught, I have no memory of Onslaught limited, although I'm sure we played it a bit back then as I have the cards to prove it). The Changelings are great; the more you have in your sealed pool, the stronger the pool becomes as you have more options. I was sad that I only got two shapeshifters. Clash is stupidly fun. You seldom win, but it's exciting! Surely Spikes won't like the mechanic, I guess it's more of a Timmy thing. Well, I guess it wasn't fun for that guy I fought who drew something like 12 or 14 cards of Hoarder's Greed. I just kept a land on top to keep him going. Yeah, I won that one\r\n\r\nI wanted to play again today, but I wouldn't have gotten there in time I think. I hope we get more limited Lorwyn events. Since I'm probably not going to be buying a box this time around, I need to play more Limited to win/acquire cards until I have something decent for Constructed.",

(See: Shocklands, Char, Psionic Blast, Vampiric Tutor). Thoughtseize is widely anticipated to be the chase rare of the set, with starcitygames.com pre-order prices starting at a staggering 17.50 USD.

With the elemental harbinger, I can see a toolbox-type elemental deck that can use various evoke elementals and giants like Nova Chaser to finish 'em off.  Lots of possibilities here actually. Force of Savagery pops in for 9? Pandemonium? Fatal Frenzy? Elementals are hot, and I'm not talking about just the Flamekin.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nEyes of the Wisent\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n-- 1G\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nTribal Enchantment -- Elemental (Rare)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nWhenever an opponent plays a spell during your turn, you may put a 4/4 green Elemental creature token into play.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nMy take:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nIs this the end of Draw-Go style decks?!?\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nDoran, the Siege Tower\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n-- BGW\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nLegendary Creature -- Treefolk Shaman (Rare)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nEach creature assigns combat damage equal to its toughness rather than its power.\r\n   \r\n\r\n  \r\n_\r\n    \r\n\"Each year that passes rings you inwardly with memory and might.

Midrange decks will love this guy. Thoughtseize provides disruption, and Doran gives the cheap beats. A \"Rock\" style deck may be in the offing.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nVivid Creek\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n   \r\nLand (Uncommon)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nVivid Creek comes into play tapped with two charge counters on it.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n{T}: Add {U} to your mana pool.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n{T}, Remove a charge counter from Vivid Creek: Add one mana of any color to your mana pool.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nMy take:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nThere's a good chance I'd like this land cycle better than the rare ones. I think Gemstone Mine just became stupid. The red one may be the best, as it facilitates a mostly-red elemental deck splashing for various evokers.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nHoofprint of the Stag\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n-- 1W\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nTribal Enchantment -- Elemental (Rare)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nWhenever you draw a card, you may put a hoofprint counter on Hoofprint of the Stag.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n{2}{W}, Remove four hoofprint counters from Hoofprint of the Stag: Put a 4/4 white Elemental creature token with flying into play. Play this ability only during your turn.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nMy take:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nI don't think it's a tier-one card, but one can't help imagine the mischief created by turn 2 Hoofprint, turn 3 Hoofprint, turn 4 Careful Consideration.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nGoldmeadow Stalwart\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n-- W\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nCreature -- Kithkin Soldier (Uncommon)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nAs an additional cost to play Goldmeadow Stalwart, reveal a Kithkin card from your hand or pay {3}.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2/2\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nMy take:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nThe comparison to Isamaru is obvious of course, as is the reason the Lions were pulled out of the Core Set. That said, I like the next guy better... \r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nWren's Run Vanquisher\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n-- 1G\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nCreature -- Elf Warrior (Uncommon)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nAs an additional cost to play Wren's Run Vanquisher, reveal an Elf card from your hand or pay {3}.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nDeathtouch\r\n   \r\n_\r\n    \r\n(Whenever this creature deals damage to a creature, destroy that creature.)\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n  \r\n\r\n   \r\n3/3\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nMy take:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nI like this better than the red or white equivalents. Face it, if Isamaru were in the same standard as 3/3 for 1G with deathtouch, he might not have been able to swing on turn 2 that often. That being said, I could see a deck with 4 Goldmeadow Stalwart and 4 Wren's Run Vanquishe... that's a lot of speed. And it also puts you in the correct colors for the next card.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nGaddock Teeg\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n-- GW\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nLegendary Creature -- Kithkin Advisor (Rare)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nNoncreature spells with converted mana cost 4 or greater can't be played.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nNoncreature spells with {X} in their mana costs can't be played.\r\n   \r\n\r\n  \r\n_\r\n    \r\nSo great is his wisdom and spirit that many who have met him say that they stood before a giant of a man and talked to the wisest of the four winds.\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n  \r\n\r\n   \r\n2/2\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nMy take:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nThis guy stops Force of Will. Oh and Wrath of God and Damnation. That W/G aggro deck is looking pretty good. Throw in some Changeling effects (to facilitate the Vanquisher and the Stalwart) and you're good to go. Not sure how well such a deck would fare in standard, but Block Constructed seems to be a given.\r\n\r\nThat's all for today!\r\n\r",

        "content": "---\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2007-09-08 21:52:02\r\ntags:\r\nMagic the Gathering\r\ntitle: 'Pre-Lorwyn Triple Treat I: Standard'\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2007/09/pre-lorwyn-triple-treat-i-standard/\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis weekend was the first of three \"Pre-Lorwyn Triple Treats\" at Neutral Ground, featuring Saturdays with three tournaments: one each of Standard, Block Constructed and Legacy. I tried preparing a deck for block but I couldn't come up with anything consistent enough. Lazily, I just picked up the Standard Rakdos deck the day before the tourney, tweaked the sideboard for the inevitable TarmoRack decks (-4 Bottle Gnomes +4 Dodecapod). I lacked a 15th sideboard card, so I toss in a random Seize the Soul. (I need to go to the office really early in order to be able to play)\r\n\r\nRound one was a guy I never met before (it happens). I can tell from his sleeves and the Akroma life counter that he's no newbie though, so I set aside any assumptions and sit down to play. He wins the roll and leads with a plains. Turns out he's some sort of B/W midrange deck. I remember he had Necrotic Slivers, I forget what else. He has land problems and I burn him out quickly game one, and while sideboarding for game two his comments are all \"Grabe, keso deck!\" I haven't actually heard anyone refer to burn as \"keso\" for a while now, and I guess he's not familiar with the current metagame where Rakdos is popular. We start game two and I hit an early Cyroclasm, giving him further land troubles, and I burn him out again.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 1: 2-0 win vs B/W midrange\r\n\r\nRound two is against one of the local judge/players, so I expect a tough match. He's playing GWb, some sort of beach house variant. The Loxodon Hierarchs are annoying and lost game one to a Troll with a Hammer. I don't have Rain of Gores, so my board is just Cryoclasms and Slaughter Pacts. Game two I keep him on the ropes, but he starts to gain control. Eventually he thinks he's stabilized at 9 and goes for the aggro, dropping a Watchwolf and a Troll on the same turn. End of his turn, I calmly put the fourth charge counter on my Molten Slagheap. Untap. Draw. Play a land. Demonfire for 9. Game three he mulligans to five, but opens with the annoying Llanowar Reborn into 4/4 Watchwolf, all I have is a random 2/2 dork. He takes me down to 8 before laying a Hierarch. End of turn: Hit, he sacrifices the Watchwolf. I play a Solifuge and have it standby to block. He declines to attack with his Hierarch. My turn, I char it and swing for six. He draws and has nothing. I draw a second Solifuge and win the game.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 2: 2-1 win vs GWb midrange\r\n\r\nRound three was vs Red/Green Greater Goyf. I figured it to be a bad matchup, I was right. I lost 2-0.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 3: 2-0 loss vs R/G Greater Goyf\r\n\r\nRound four was U/B Teachings. I had playtested with this guy during the Philippine Open, where we both had the exact same decks. I won that time, and I won this time too, despite getting hit by a Haunting Hymn for four. U/B control is a dog to Rakdos.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 4: 2-0 win vs UB Teachings Control\r\n\r\nI finished my round quickly so I took a look at the top tables. The guy who beat me last round was beating up another Rakdos player. The Rakdos guy lost, and I found myself paired against him in round five. I brought up the Greater Goyf matchup. We agree that it's really bad, as even the common Mogg War Marshall is already a disadvantage for Rakdos. We shuffle up and get going. The Rakdos mirror is mainly luck-based, it depends on whose deck decides to be more consistent. I'm glad I'm lucky, topdecking Solifuges in both games to get the win. His Solifuges never made an appearance.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 5: 2-0 win vs BR Rakdos\r\n\r\nRound six we sit at the table and pass our decks for the cut when one of the judges stops us. \"Table 24? Deck check.\" Wow, my first deck check. We get our decks back without incident and get a five minute time extension. Not that we'd need it. Turns out my opponent is playing BG TarmoRack. I get beat up in game one and we proceed to sideboarding. I smile knowing that I'll be able to use those Dodecapods I boarded in at the last minute. I control the second game on the back of the awesome Seize the Soul and a Withered Wretch keeping his Goyf down. He tries to stabilize with a Smallpox when I only have a Rakdos Guildmage, but I show him the Dodecapod. Game three he mulligans down to five but has the Rack + Goyf start. We trade creatures and eventually get into a state where we're both low on life and on topdeck mode. Again, glad I'm lucky as I draw the Demonfire.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 6: 2-1 win vs BG TarmoRack\r\n\r\nRound seven, I'm 3rd in the rankings. No point playing as the prize is the same for first to fourth place (Lorwyn Prerelease Pass), so I offer the ID. He declines, says he hopes to get his friend into the top four. I shrug and start shuffling up. He starts with Island. I cheer inside.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nRound 7: 2-0 win vs UB Pickles\r\n\r\nFinal record: 6-1, and I finish first. Yeah, feels good to be winning, even if there were only around forty players in the Standard portion hehe.\r\n\r\nI get to play in the Prerelease for free 😀",

I've been a long-time player, having started around the time of Revised more than twelve years ago, but I've never seriously started playing in tournaments in such until I had a job, which meant more money to spend on Magic (also meant less free time though =/)\r\n\r\nAs anyone who has immersed himself in this game knows, Magic is an addictive experience. When you're in the thick of it you're always thinking of new decks, card interactions, etc. hopefully to make yourself a better player. Lately I've been thinking of writing more about Magic, but my personal blog has been mostly filled with Magic posts lately, so I thought it better to just create a separate space for writing about Magic.\r\n\r\nSo, here we go: Roy on Magic.\r\n\r\n_\r\n    \r\n(All Magic-related posts from the other blog have been moved here.)\r\n   \r\n_\r\n\r",

More on that later.\r\n\r\nRound 1: 0-2 loss. I lose due to bad beats here, mulliganing into a one-land hand both games.\r\n\r\nRound 2: 2-1 win. The win here was over a former National champ, who apparently has never beaten me before, as he shook his head commenting \"Roy Tang, hindi ko matalo... \" Strangely, I only remember beating him one other time... \r\n\r\nRound 3: 0-2 loss. Several misplays here. More on that leter.\r\n\r\nRound 4: 2-1 win. The guy was a bit green, we had to call a judge several times over minor issues.\r\n\r\n2-2. Maybe I could still get a decent finish... just need to win 3 in a row.\r\n\r\nRound 5: 0-2 loss. Damn it!\r\n\r\nSo I drop. Damn, I hate dropping, it makes me feel so incompetent at Magic. I know, it happens, bad beats etc. But in this case I really was incompetent.  Learn from your mistakes right? The mistakes here were... \r\n\r\nNot enough removal. Seriously, I should've probably at least splashed for the Tarfire and the Consuming Bonfire. That would've been a better choice than Rootgrapple. (To be fair, the Treefolk Instant actually took out Garuk for me. I still lost that game though.)\r\n\r\nBeing blinded by shiny stuff. I saw the 2 Goldmeadow Stalwarts and the Thoughtweft Trio and just had to go Kithkin. I saw the Timber Protector and just forced my treefolk in there. I don't know if my second choice (UBR Faerie/Goblin) would have been better, but I definitely didn't give enough consideration to the other cards. I forced the Kithkin/Treefolk build too much, trying to put in a lot of Kithkin to maximize the Stalwarts I ended up with too many 2/x dorks that didn't do anything.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nNot having a good plan.Yeah. Evasion guys would have been a good plan. A bunch of small Kithkin guys? Not so much. Even though I could get the awesome double Stalwart opening (I never did), it's not consistent enough. Trying to win in Sealed by rushing small dudes isn't a very reliable since it's more likely for them to have midrange guys as well. I had a few fatties yeah, but in n environment with 2 common tappers, it wasn't very effective. Which reminds me... \r\n\r\nNot having a way to kill tappers!\r\n\r\nNot paying attention to game state. In one game, I had a creature with a Stalactite equipped and I attacked into Protection from Elf guy. I had several misplays in round 3 where we stalled with like 15 creatures on each side of the board. My opponent put down a Mulldrifter and equipped a Runed Stalactite, while he had an Imperious Perfect in play. I didn't realize until too late that it got +1/+1 from the Perfect.  My opponent wanted to create an elf token and he was searching for a good item to use. I gave him one of my dice to use and only later realized that I was actually using it to track my own Kithkin tokens! By then it was too late as I would've lost anyway on the next alpha strike, but maybe having those tokens on my side could have convinced me to make my own alpha strike as it was a close game.\r\n\r\nImpatience.In round 3 again, I was facing a creature stall on game one and I made a massive mistake, attacking with two Treefolk and two Springjacks hoping I could get at least one double-strike off the clash. Obviously I got none, and I lost two Springjacks for nothing. I should've just waited out the stall instead of being impatient.\r\n\r\nI make so many mistakes like this which make me question why some people think I'm a good limited player. I'm not &#8212; I just had a good streak for a while that brought my rating up to 1800 but it will surely drop down now. I'm glad I decided not to even consider going to GP:Bangkok as I'm obviously not yet ready. Luckily there are 4 Kuala Lumpur PTQs scheduled for the Philippines, all of them Lorwyn Sealed of course, giving me a chance to learn from my mistakes and make a comeback.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by ogie jaro on 2007-11-02 16:56:59 +0000\r\nhi, i chanced upon your site a couple of months back and just would like to\r\n  \r\nsay that i really like your work, you should consider submitting articles for\r\n  \r\nng\r\n\r\nanyway from a quick scan of your pool, i think you have a viable UW tempo\r\n  \r\noption\r\n\r\nhave a nice day\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2007-11-02 17:08:03 +0000\r\neh, I'll consider submitting an article to NG if I actually get a decent\r\n  \r\nfinish. 😀",

Unless you're the sort of software developer who just sells the same piece of software over and over again, at some point in time you'll to need to find out how to implement some feature you've never tried before. Or you'll hit a problem that's not documented in any official docs and you need that critical functionality.\r\n\r\nTypically, there are two approaches: Research and Experimentation. Today I'll talk about Research.\r\n\r\nResearch means the internet of course, but what part of it exactly? At first of course you should search for the information yourself, using Google usually. But often if the technology is new or the problem is esoteric enough, you won't be able to find what you need (or you would need very precise keywords). The second step is to ask for expert help.\r\n\r\nAs an example, some recent postings of mine on a Microsoft-related forum (I was trying to figure out how to do an addin for Microsoft Office) elicited a mail from someone with the subject \"Hello, I need ur help\". I was feeling a bit helpful, so I gave him a reply. I'm not sure if it was smarmy or anything, but I also gave him some additional advice, and I quote:\r\n\r\n\"Also I have some additional free advice for you:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nYour email looks like SPAM. I was about to mark it as spam when I happened to spot the phrase \"MSWord Addins\" in the body. Learn to write better email subjects.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nSending personal emails to people asking for help isn't a very good way to solve technical issues. Most people are likely to ignore such requests.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nYou might want to read this: http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\"\r\n\r\nI'm not trying to deride him or anything, god knows I've sent my own share of personal email requests for help before. And it's correct that they are often ignored, so it's not very effective. I think the most effective way, as mentioned in the ESR link above, is to use forums. Specifically, don't look for forums where newbies like us ask questions; use forums where experts congregate. By forum, I'm not strictly referring to bulletin boards, it also includes mailing-lists.\r\n\r\nHow to find the best forums? It depends on what you're looking for.\r\n\r\nThe best thing is if your subject matter of choice has an active community of developers interested or passionate about the product. Google about the subject matter and see what forums or mailing lists are popular. An example would be Adobe Flex, which I started reading up on a while back for a work-related issue. Finding help on Adobe Flex is really easy. There's a very active mailing-list, where you can even expect replies from some of the guys who actually made Flex. If you visit some of the active blogs about Flex (there are a lot), many of them will reference the flexcoders mailing list so you know you can get a lot of good help there.\r\n\r\nNon-official forums are better because people are more likely to be passionate than paid reps. One problem I often encounter when researching is Microsoft. Whenever I search for Microsoft-related stuff inevitably sources dry up -- there are literally hundreds of unofficial forums where many newbies ask questions. Now, what to recognize about Microsoft is that they have hundreds (maybe thousands?) of experts called MVPs in every different Microsoft technology. These MVPs are recognized by Microsoft for providing unofficial support to the community. So, the trick is to figure out where you can post such that a good number of MVPs will see your question and possibly respond.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what the best place would be, but the one that I have gotten the most results from would be Google Groups. Any of the microsoft.public.* ones. I guess Google Groups would be pretty good for non-MS topics as well, but I find that inevitably my MS searches lead me here. For Office-related questions at least there are often one or two MVPs who reply.\r\n\r\nAnother resource I have used on occasion: the forums at Joel on Software. A lot of very good developers frequent those forums, so even if no one can answer your questions, they might be able to point you in the right direction.\r\n\r\nBeyond forums, well good luck. At this point you might need to resort to personal emails, although I have personally never gotten any success from such a method. Or you probably have to resort to detailed experimentation or even -- god forbid -- giving up.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/\r\n [2]: http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/flexcoders/\r\n [3]: http://groups.google.com/\r\n [4]: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by advanced on 2007-10-31 17:37:02 +0000\r\nHmm.. you've overlooked the motivational force of money and the power of sub-\r\n  \r\ncontracting.\r\n\r\nRome was not built in a day, nor was it built by a single pair of hands.\r\n\r\nIf you know what the problem is or at very least the desired objective, you'll\r\n  \r\nfind skilled people lining up to work on your project at most of the various\r\n  \r\nfreelance developer sites.\r\n\r\nOf course if you're asking someone to build the next super web framework\r\n  \r\nthey'll expect a kings ransom and most likely never finish.\r\n\r\nBut if you can narrow it down to a simple and exact task such as \"I need a\r\n  \r\nthemed input button that is cross-browser compliant\" you'll find people\r\n  \r\nwilling to provide top notch solutions practically for free (minus a good\r\n  \r\nreview and the associated freelancer site fees ~$5).\r\n\r\nEven wasting an hour googling the answer probably won't be as cost effective.\r\n  \r\nMost of the time you can even request demo examples to make sure they're not\r\n  \r\njust trying to run a scam.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2007-10-31 21:21:42 +0000\r\nThat's probably a good idea, but not really something that's an option with\r\n  \r\nthe company I'm in.

Legend of Zelda: Phantom Hourglass for a few days now; the controls are purely-stylus driven so my wrist aches a bit after a few hours of play. Of course the game has been consuming a good number of my waking hours (I didn't even play any Magic this weekend), but that's not what this post is about. This post is about the original Legend of Zelda.\r\n\r\nThe first time I played the game, I was able to borrow some sort of faulty and/or bootleg copy that wasn't able to save games. Stupid right? Well, it could save as long as the console wasn't powered off, so you could still progress a bit. So in theory, with a single marathon gaming session, I could've finished the game. The thing is, during those days my dad didn't like having us play too much video games. At most he'd let us play maybe 1-2 hours at a time. On weekends. I'm sure there's some sort of speed run where some hardcore dude finished the Legend of Zelda in like fifteen minutes, but no way I would've been able to do that as a kid.\r\n\r\nStill, that limitation became a sort of challenge. We tried getting as far ahead in the game as we could within what time we had. As kids that day were wont to do, my brother and I memorized the heck out of the Zelda world map. Up to this day, from muscle memory alone, looking at a random overworld Zelda screen I could point if any trees or cliff walls could be burned or blasted to reveal a secret. (The dungeons were another matter, since 90% of the game time was spent in the overworld, I was far more familiar with it.)\r\n\r\nLater, we were able to borrow a decent (read: able to save!) copy, and the quest to beat the game began in earnest. Of course, given our previous time-limited trials, we were well familiar with the game, and I don't know how long it took us to defeat the mad sorcerer Gannon and free Princess Zelda, but I have no memory of it being particularly difficult, so I suppose it was not a long period. Besides, we would have needed to return the cartridge eventually.\r\n\r\nDespite beating the game, we didn't seem to grow tired of it. Sometimes I felt like we craved the dungeon-crawling even more. Through friends who actually had money to buy gaming magazines, we found out about the second quest. We would borrow the cartridge again, and eventually beat the second quest as well. Bored but still immersed in the game, we would then proceed to try various challenges.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if we can beat the game without getting the sword?\" Well, no. The fourth dungeon boss (two-headed dragon) requires a sword to defeat. Of course we just did the next best thing -- we beat the first three dungeons without getting the wooden sword; Boomerangs, Bombs and Candles were enough for us!\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if we can beat the game without getting additional Heart Containers?\" This one was far more difficult than the other one, as staying at three hearts meant instant death if you took a hit in the later dungeons. Eventually we realized it was theoretically possible to finish the game with less than three hearts, given that there were rooms that could take away a Heart Container. My memories are fuzzy on this one, so I don't know if we actually fulfilled this challenge. I'm sure we whiled away a few hours trying it out though.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure when we eventually grew tired of the game and stopped borrowing it. But the Zelda overworld theme music was pretty much burned into our memories. The music is familiar even to my second youngest brother, who could not have been more than three years old at the time we were playing the game.\r\n\r\nAfter the original Zelda, I eventually finished Link to the Past on the SNES, then skipping out on the N64/Gamecube/Game Boy generation of Zelda games since I didn't have those consoles. Of course I could play those games on an emulator, but it wasn't really the same thing. An emulator's save/load game state was far too powerful for one to enjoy the game. Holding the NDS in my hands and playing the Phantom Hourglass brings back childhood memories of walking through unforgiving dungeons and defeating vicious bosses with just enough life to stay alive; a single misstep or badly timed sword thrust would destroy hours of progress [1]. A boy dressed in green traveling across a vast land filled with dangerous monsters to stop a great evil and save a princess. So very cliche. One that an entire generation of gamers has kept coming back to... \r\n\r\n[1] Phantom Hourglass is a lot more forgiving of course, which is good considering I no longer have the hand-eye coordination of a twelve-year old.\r\n\r",

Format was Standard. I didn't have any good deck ideas this time around (some would argue I never do!), so I played a netdeck. I played the Mannequin deck that originally appeared in US States, as reported by BDM here. I had to change the board around a bit, I went with:\r\n\r\n4 Nameless Inversion (to help kill black/artifact critters)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Vesuvan Shapeshifter (get random tricks off pickles, and kill legends)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 extirpate\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 bottle gnomes\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 damnation\r\n\r\nI had very minimal testing, but I was fairly sure aggro decks were a cakewalk, and control decks are winnable headaches. The tournament report follows.\r\n\r\nI register for the tourney, and on the spot I name the deck \"Manny\"\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nLorywn Inaugurals Tournament Report\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 1 : vs Black/Green Tarmorack\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nThis matchup is heavily in Manny's favor due to the card advantage. He has a not so good draw and I win game one easily.\r\n\r\nI board +4 Nameless Inversion, -2 Grim Harvest and -2 random guys.\r\n\r\nGame two, he attacks third turn with a Treetop Village, I hit it with a nameless inversion and he's down a land. On my turn I play the Shadowmage Infiltrator and it's all uphill from there.\r\n\r\n2-0 win. Good start!\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 2: vs Monoblack\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nThe deck is not monoblack aggro, more of disruption + midsize creatures (Shriekmaw, Crovax the black, Korlash). The matchup seems bad for Manny\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nsince I have 8 dead cards (Shadowmage Infiltrator and Shriekmaw) I lose game one to Crovax the black, I didn't even notice that my Epochrasite was dead on arrival.

He has a warhammer, so any creature that comes out I immediately hit with removal. My offense consists almost entirely of two epochrasites and a faerie conclave. An interesting board position came during this game:\r\n\r\nMy side: Faerie Conclave, Epochrasite, other lands. No removal in hand, and I'm at 17 life.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nHis side: Warhammer, no creatures. Urza's Factory, Mouth of Ronom + 6-7 other lands. He's at five life.\r\n\r\nI swing with Faerie Conclave and Epochrasite, then immediately realize the mistake. I had assumed he would just Ronom the Faerie, but if instead he makes a Factory worker and blocks the Epochrasite I'm screwed since I have no removal and he can equip the warhammer next turn to climb back in life. Luckily, he assumes that I do have removal and does not risk taking the two damage from the faerie. I win game 2.\r\n\r\nGame 3, we had less than ten minutes left, so I play quickly. However, since I had boarded in removal, my side was now control. He had sided back in most of his creatures so he got the aggro draw. We trade hits for a while, but eventually he gets out a 9/6 Korlash with lifelink (warhammer) and there's no way I can catch up.\r\n\r\n1-2 loss.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 3 -- B/R Goblins\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nSorry to my opponent but this matchup was really easy. Manny's removal and card advantage is more than enough to keep the Goblins in check,\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nand Phyrexian Ironfoot + Epochrasite is really bad for their deck. 2-0 win.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 4 -- UGw Shifters\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nUG shifters. With the Shapeshifter, Thelonite Hermit and all, + white for blink. I win game 1, he seems to have a bad draw.\r\n\r\nI bring in Shapeshifters of my own to take advantage of his hermits. I lose game two to a Mystic Snake that was blinked 4 times (including flashback).\r\n\r\nGame three I take a midgame advantage, he has 2 morphs down but is obviously waiting for a second forest to turn the hermit face up. He\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nplays a Birds of Paradise. And I pass my turn without doing anything to it. (Mistake no. 1)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nOf course I attempt to bounce it during his turn (Mistake no. 2). He of course flips the hermit, creates saprolings etc.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI stall off the saps coz I have a lot of ironfoot blockers. I swing with a Shriekmaw. (Mistake no. 3) He of course turns the other morph\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nface up, revealing shapeshifter, copying one of the ironfoot guys. :(\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI lost obviously, with those kinds of mistakes it's a wonder I held out so long.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n1-2 loss.\r\n\r\nSo 2-2 now. But it's an 8-round tourney, so\r\n   \r\n**\r\n    \r\nmaybe\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nI can still make\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\ntop 8. I fight on.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 5 -- B/G Tarmorack\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n   \r\nWooh! Lucky, a good matchup. I take it again in two games with massive card advantage.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2-0 win.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 6 -- R/G aggro\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nGame one was not too difficult, given the massive card advantage.\r\n\r\nGame two, he managed to bring down my life early with three Ascetics before I could play the Damnation. I lost to Barbs (he also had a Wisent but that's a blank against me)\r\n\r\nGame three he gets the Barbs down while we're still at a high enough life. I play Venser to send it back, going down to 4, and on my turn I drop 3 creatures to discourage him from playing it again. It works, he instead drops creatures of his own. I play Profane Command for the win.\r\n\r\n2-1 win\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 7 -- U/W control\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n   \r\nHe seems to be permission light.\r\n\r\nGame one, I bring him down to 14 and he plays Akroma off charge lands.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI take the first hit (down to 14 life).\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMy turn I play Infiltrator and Epochrasite comes out of suspend.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI take the next hit (down to 8 life)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI swing with Infiltrator, then play two ironfoots.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI take the next hit (down to 2 life)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMy turn, Profane Command for 5, opponent loses 5 and all my guys get fear. Nice game.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI board in Shapeshifters to deal with Crovax the White and Akroma.\r\n\r\nGame two he got out an early Crovax.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI play Shapeshifter to kill Crovax. He plays Akroma.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI play Mannequin on Shapeshifter. (Opponent: \"Ano ba yan!\")\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI get out fear guys. He gets out Triskelavus, we start racing.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI play Mannequin again, targetting shapeshifter, copying Triskelavus (a Shapeshifter with 3 +1/+1 counters is pretty good)\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nHe plays Disenchant on the Shapeshifter! (Opponent: \"Ang squatter naman\")\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI eventually manage to bounce his triskelavus.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nWe race some more, I win with 3 life remaining.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2-0 win\r\n\r\nYeah, one more win and possibily top 8! But I look at the standings and I'm last among the 5-2s :( Boo! 21th place, too far away. If I win the last round I make top 16 and win three packs. Lose, and I probably still get one pack. Then, it's practically \"no bearning\" for me now, I get at least one pack either way. (Yes, this story does not end in a top eight finish, I apologize.)\r\n\r\nSo I slack off in round 8. In a matchup where I need to slack off the least -- pickles.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 8 -- UB pickles\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n   \r\nHe's playing pickles with black instead of the usual white for momentary blink. He has an aggro mode with Ironfoots and Shadowmages, Cryptic Command for permission, Ancestral Visions for card draw. This is the first round I'm playing the pickles combo, so I'm sorta still stupid (or slacking off, as I said.) What I understand about the pickles matchup is that you have to be careful not to tap out if your opponent has 10-11 mana already -- since he can lock you down at any time (even less for the white version which has blink).\r\n\r\nGame one I lost to pickles lock.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI side in +4 Nameless Inversion (Mistake... should have also brought in +3 Extirpate)\r\n\r\nGame two I lost to pickles lock. Okay, a bit longer story. I lost to pickles lock after making the misplay of bouncing the Brine Elemental so he could delay me one more turn. He had Liliana Vess out -- he was going to get the other half of the combo no matter what. If I had an Extirpate then the bounce was the correct play, as there was already a Brine Elemental in the yard.\r\n\r\nSo, I finish 5-3 with the Mannequin deck, a crappy 32nd place, winning a single booster! In fairness, I got an Auntie's Hovel from that booster, so it's all good.\r\n\r\nDuring the tournament some people were asking me whether it was difficult to play. I don't think so. Two of the losses I attribute to bad plays on my part, and the monoblack matchup was just bad. After boarding it was probably 50-50 or 60-40 at best. The weakness I can see is the lack of instant speed removal (unless you have a Shriekmaw in the graveyard), so Treetop Villages cause problems. I always board in the Nameless Inversions for decks with Treetops.\r\n\r\nManabarbs is also very bad for the deck, as you have no permission to stop it, only bounce. At the minimum you will take 4 damage (or 2 damage and wait 3 turns) to bounce the Barbs, then have one turn to try to get back in the game before they cast it again.\r\n\r\nAlso, the Mannequin tricks are awesome and will lead to some devastating draws and plays. But every so often you draw something like 3 Mannequins and a Grim Harvest, with your only creatures being Epochrasite, Phyrexian Ironfoot or Shadowmage, all of which are not that good with the reanimation. Next time I will probably cut 2 Grim Harvest entirely.\r\n\r\nNext: PTQ KL #2.\r\n\r",

Note here that I they had a shortage of boosters and had to split tournament packs into 3 boosters to be able to accomodate all the players.\r\n\r\nDecklist/Card pool later, I'm too lazy to type it up. Unfortunately, I failed to learn from the previous mistakes as I got blinded by the shiny again, thinking I could actually cast Horde of Notions, so I went with an almost-five color build, major red-blue-and-green. Yes, no tribal synergy at all. (To be fair, HoN was only a dead card once)\r\n\r\nRound 1: 0-2 loss vs R/W Ajani\r\n\r\nPlay mistakes here: In game one, I hit Lash Out on Galepowder Mage while there was a Kithkin Healer on the board. In game two I should have tutored for the Lignify using Treefolk Harbinger to stop the Mirror Entity.\r\n\r\nRound 2: 0-2 loss vs U/W\r\n\r\nI don't remember much as the games went fast. I managed to cast the Horde of Notions only to have it take a Glimmerdust Nap. Of course, I forgot  that I could still activate the Horde of Notions ability to recast Consuming Bonfire on the opposing Mirror Entity. (Yes, I was losing to a mirror entity again.) Instead, I did something really stupid: He had three creatures on the board, I had a 1/1 merfolk, a 1/1 changeling that can give other creatures changeling, and a Thundercloud Shaman in my hand. I figured I could wipe all his creatures if I Thundercloud for 3, so I\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\ntap the changeling to turn my merfolk into a giant and cast the Giant. After casting the Shaman, I immediately realized the problems:\r\n\r\na. One of his creatures was a changeling (wouldn't die to Shaman)\r\n\r\nb. That creature was a Mirror Entity (can prevent all his creatures from dying to Shaman)\r\n\r\nI pretty much deserved the 17 damage that came my way the next turn.\r\n\r\nOkay, that makes me sad. I'm at 0-2 obviously I'm pretty much dead. I decided not to drop so I could salvage some wins and maybe learn to actually play better.\r\n\r\nRound 3: 2-0 win vs R/G\r\n\r\nWorst problem was an Epic Proportions... no wait, that was the previous tournament. I count 58 cards in the opponent's pile shuffle and mention to him that he's over 40. He says \"Yeah, probably should trim it.\" and he's right. He's color screwed both games, so easy win.\r\n\r\nRound 4: 2-1 win vs (I forgot what the deck was)\r\n\r\nMy deck really performed here, giving me so much removal I couldn't even remember what his creatures were. I hit Tarfire, Lash Out and Nameless Inversion and put him on fast clocks. I got him down to one and an evoked Cloudthresher did the job.\r\n\r\nRound 5: 1-2 loss vs B/G\r\n\r\nThe opponent jokes around about his bad deck and wonders how he even got two wins. I lose game 1 to 1/1s and 2/2s, all I had was the Stonybrook Angler.  Game 2 I mulligan to six and he keeps, but he misses the 3rd land drop. I have a Cloudgrown Oak carrying a Runed Stalactite, a five-turn clock. He gets the third land and tries to play Eyeblight's Ending on it and I shake my head. \"Elf.\" He gets out a few blockers at 8 and trades two for one with the Oak. I cast the Treefolk Harbinger for Changeling Titan. When the Titan attacks, he tries the Eyeblight's Ending again, and I shake my head again. Right, he scoops and we go to game three. Game three I mulligan to six again, only it's a proper mana screw this time. I barely put up a fight and lose to random dorks.\r\n\r\nSo 2-3 and drop. Quite disappointing, as it seems I'm not improving my limited game at all. I still made a suboptimal sealed deck build (was siding in the same six cards every round) and made several play mistakes. I would blame lack of sleep, but obviously I didn't have my A-game this time around. Hopefully, the next few PTQs are better for me.",

Format was Lorwyn Sealed.\r\n\r\nI open a pretty good sealed pool this time. Notable cards include Mistbind Clique, Profane Command, Mulldrifter, Cloudgoat Ranger, Oblivion Ring, Shriekmaw and Silvergill Douser. Haven't written up the sealed pool yet, will probably do so later. I play major blue, minor black and white.\r\n\r\nRound 1: 2-0 win vs BG Goblin/Elf\r\n\r\nRound 2: 2-0 win vs UB Faeries\r\n\r\nRound 3 vs merfolk, things start getting interesting.\r\n\r\nI'm about to win game 3 on my next attack phase as the opponent is at four life, I have a Pestermite and a Cloudgoat Ranger. However, thanks to his Drowner of Secrets and 4 other &#8216;folk, I'm down to 8 cards in the library, just enough to survive one more turn.\r\n\r\nHe draws his card for the turn and quickly says done with two cards in hand. He's practically dead, so I wonder what he has up his sleeve; I fear removal and I'm sure to lose if I don't kill him next turn so I decide to ensure the victory. End of turn, I play Mistbind Clique (planning to champion Turtleshell Changeling).\r\n\r\nMy opponent perks up, \"wow, I might actually win this thing.\" He taps all his lands and plays Broken Ambitions for some large amount I could not possibly play. I'm shocked at his play until I remember that Broken Ambitions actually has a clash ability that matters in this matchup. I frown as I flip Island, and my opponent flips Silvergill Douser. I never get past my next draw phase. :/\r\n\r\n1-2 loss vs UW merfolk\r\n\r\nRound 4: 2-0 win vs RB\r\n\r\nRound 5: 2-0 win vs RB\r\n\r\nI had some fun clashes in that last round. In one I flip Profane Command with my opponent at a very low life. \"Oh come on! Put it at the bottom!\" he jokes.\r\n\r\nWow, doing pretty well aren't we? 4-1 going into the 6th round of a PTQ is pretty swell. One more win and I can draw into top eight... \r\n\r\nRound 6 I get smashed in the face. 0-2 loss vs I don't even remember what. The guy I fought here is well known as one of the better players around, he often top 8's local tourneys, etc. I have played him maybe 4-5 times and I have never won against him. And it always seems to be a blowout too. Of course it's all superstition, as I have on occasion been able to play evenly with other players who are also very good. I need to learn to improve my mental game so I don't get rattled by specific players. Someday, I will beat him!\r\n\r\nStandings are up before round 7. I'm not going to make it.\r\n\r\nRound 7 1-2 loss vs GBu\r\n\r\nVery awesome deck he had, playing 2 Nameless Inversions at least 3 Battlewand Oak, Profane Command, Dread, etc. I lost the deciding game due to being too aggressive. I had the Profane Command in hand and used it up early to take out a blocker so a random 1/1 and 2/2 could attack. I ended up regretting it later as I did not draw any other removal to handle his Aethersnipe and Oaks.\r\n\r\nBah, 4-3. At least it's better than the last PTQ. And I finish 25th, still getting one booster pack! (Don't remember what I got)\r\n\r\nNext: Standard.",

Which means that unlike a real draft where I can focus 100% on the draft, in Magic Online I could possibly be doing several other things such as coding, blogging, random surfing, IM, etc. that may cause terrible misclicks such as a first-pick Faultgrinder (true story)\r\n\r\nI should stop writing this post now and maybe try to salvage the draft.",

Random Chinese popups appearing, mysterious processes in the taskbar. As needed, virus scans and adware scans are done. Trojans are identified and quarantined, but keep reappearing. Brian plays WoW on the machine despite the issues.\r\n\r\nYesterday: Alvin decides to reformat the machine and begins backing up. Brian plays WoW on the machine in my room instead.\r\n\r\nTonight, around 8 PM: I'm surfing the &#8216;net at work before I go for the day, I receive an instant message from Alvin telling me they can't login to the WoW account. I try the password recovery, but it won't accept my details. I IM Alvin to keep trying, and hurry home.\r\n\r\nAround 9:30 PM: I notice emails that tell me that a paid character transfer has been performed on the WoW account. We've been hacked! I immediately use the web form on Blizzard's site to report the incident. I've already lost $25 to the hacker.\r\n\r\nWe still have no idea how it happened. My best guess is a keylogger on the other machine that trapped the WoW account password. We've been toning down the WoW-playing lately, so it may be time to kill the account, if Blizzard actually responds in time. In the worst case, I'll need to have my credit card canceled if Blizzard refuses to help.\r\n\r\nEdit 23-Nov 7:37 AM: Around 12:30 AM today, Blizzard reset my account password and notified that they were in the process of character transfer reversal. I immediately went in and updated the details. Very good service, Changed my passwords elsewhere too, for good measure.\r\n\r\nMore as it develops...",

(And Year in Review)\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2007/12/magic-stats-and-year-in-review/\r\n---\r\n\r\nI believe that this year, I have managed to improve my Magic-playing a bit (despite the abundance of embarassing mistakes).I also believe I'm slightly better at Limited than I am at Constructed. TO back up these beliefs, I could point to my DCI ratings. But as a programmer who loves stats, I compiled additional stats for my own pleasure: My Playing Stats \r\n   \r\n.\r\n\r\nA bit of background: I've been playing Magic on and off since Revised, but only gotten into the tournament scene seriously in 2006. I've played in a few Limited tourneys before that, but I guess I took them with a different DCI number as they don't reflect on my ratings history. In particular I remember placing 2nd at a Team Sealed event at BCI Makati back during the Invasion block era. And I'm pretty sure I went 4-0 at an Onslaught prerelease, as I have the shirt to prove it.\r\n\r\nAs can be seen in the stats page though, this was the year I started taking it seriously. I devoted more time to Magic, studying my own technical play for faults and missteps, struggling to learn from every mistake. I read more articles online and tried to practice on Magic Online more to improve my game.  I joined more tournaments (31 this year versus 18 the previous year), and got 9 top 8's this year as opposed to 2 last year. (Granted, some of those were for Prereleases :p) I managed a GPT top 8 and a PTQ top 8 this year, my first ones ever!\r\n\r\nStill, I have a long way to go towards improving. I was disappointed to find out my match win percentage was under 60% (although I have no idea how much higher the match win percentage of top players would be.) For next year I hope I can push that win percentage even more, make fewer misplays and get more PTQ top 8s (although I doubt I will be able to play in the extended season... maybe Block Constructed). My goal is to stabilize my rating in the top 75 of the Philippines so that I can play in Nationals without having to go through those horrendous qualifiers.\r\n\r\nWish me luck 😀\r\n\r",

(I try to at least) Somehow there always seem to be so many CDs/DVDs/books/comics to sort up and shelf or sleeve or whatnot. I'm growing tired of it all.\r\n\r\nThe other day I was planning to backup everything on my computer to DVD when I realized I was just adding more to the pile. I'm not sure if there's any important reason to backup all the episodes I've been watching to DVD when I've already watched them all. Of course the argument can be made that it makes it easier to lend out to people, but truth be told there are a lot of people I know who already have such copies so my keeping backups is just redundant. And it's not like the world would end if someone wasn't able to borrow the last season of Heroes off me.\r\n\r\nI'm especially wary now about committing stuff to optical media; going through all the discs I had I encountered quite a few that were already beyond recovery. I'm considering reburning some of the older stuff from CDs to DVDs, both to conserve space and to make sure I can still access those old files later on. But I'm unsure now how to dispose of the stack of dead CD in an environment-friendly manner.\r\n\r\nSo, am I too much of a packrat? I dunno, like I said I know people who have loads more stuff on CDs/DVDs than I do, and they've never watched them all. At least I've managed to consume at least 90% of the stuff I archive. I guess it's a geek thing, to want to have access to \"historical data\" and stuff. Organizing all of it is probably a geek thing too. Heck, I'm trying to think of a way to have everything be searchable.\r\n\r\nI'm considering buying something like a 250 GB external and just using that as a backup. Eventually it would run out, but by then something like 1 TB drives might be common enough. Tempting... \r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by mikong on 2007-12-28 23:01:23 +0000\r\nYou're probably too much of a packrat. And you don't need to compare yourself\r\n  \r\nto people you know. What's important is if you need those videos, and from\r\n  \r\nwhat you said I'm guessing you don't. Don't backup those videos unless they're\r\n  \r\nvery rare or your favorite of all time.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple people I know who back everything up, and sometimes I\r\n  \r\nborrow from them. A lot of other people borrow from them too. I think we only\r\n  \r\nneed a few them. If you're not the go-to-guy for these things, don't backup.\r\n\r\nYou might even find it refreshing if you throw all those CD's away. Sometimes\r\n  \r\nit's good not to have these attachments.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2007-12-30 00:43:42 +0000\r\n... or maybe you're just not geeky enough. :p\r\n\r\nOr maybe it's a boy scout thing. You always need to be prepared to whip out\r\n  \r\nhalf a season of Heroes on demand.\r\n\r\nI probably will dispose of most of them. I'm keeping the Simpsons ones though.\r\n\r\n\"Spider-pig, Spider-pig, does whatever a spider-pig can... \"",

I know from experience that this is stupid, as my feet will get sweaty and I'll be uncomfortable all day.

I quickly went for +2/+0 thinking I had enough damage to win the game. As he considered his options I realize the miscount and that he would live with 1 life, killing me the next turn with two Kithkin guys with no blockers. Oh man, what an idiot. I just saw the Final Revels topdeck and played it without thinking. NEVER AGAIN. I figure I'll recover in game 2, but I draw no lands.\r\n\r\nSigh. 1 and 2 after 3 rounds. I figure I'll play until I get the 3rd loss, maybe win some packs.\r\n\r\nRound 4: 0-2 loss vs GWb.\r\n\r\nOops... so much for that plan. I keep him back on tempo with Whirlpool Whelms and faeries, but he eventually overwhelms me with critters.\r\n\r\nFacing lethal damage in game two, I pick up the result slip and tick the \"Drop\" option.\r\n\r\nSigh, one more PTQ to go, last chance to go to Kuala Lumpur. I made so many bloopers this tournament, and my mental game was so off... must do better next time.\r\n\r\nBut first, next week: Standard.",

He's playing some R-B-W combination, fast aggro stuff. I'm faster in game 1 and manage to play Colfenor's Plans, attracting some onlookers who told me it was a deathtrap. I had read about some pros liking it and wanted to try it out. The logic being, if you're out of cards anyway, and you can only play one spell per turn anyway (the one you topdeck), and you can win with just a bit more push, might as well grab the next seven cards immediately. As one of the judges pointed out, I didn't need to play the plans, it was plain greedy, since my opponent was at six and I had a flier and two Tar Pitchers out.\r\n\r\nGame 2, I hit Footbottom Feast targetting Spiderwig Boggart then I put the Boggart in my hand then said, \"draw a card from feast\". I looked at the top card before my opponent could stop me. Oops, of course the Boggart was already the draw from the feast, so I got a warning for looking at extra cards and the judge shuffles my deck. I'm glad it's not a game loss, but it doesn't matter as I lose to an aggressive Blades of Velis Vel.\r\n\r\nGame 3, I mull to five and am unable to recover.\r\n\r\nRound 1: 1-2 loss. Yes, not a good start.\r\n\r\nSecond round is... some guy. Don't recall what he was playing. I win in 2 games.\r\n\r\nRound 2: 2-0 win\r\n\r\nThird round is a guy I've been up against a few times before. His deck is black-green but light on removal. I power out Giants, he stacks Treefolk on his side to keep me from attacking, dragging out the game. (I hate fighting Black Poplars!) but eventually I take it in 2 games.\r\n\r\nRound 3: 2-0 win\r\n\r\nFourth round is against one of the better limited players around, he plays fast so somehow I'm forced to match his pace. I don't remember his deck, though it must have had blue because I remember getting countered. We trade the first two games, and I draw no gas for game three.\r\n\r\nRound 4: 1-2 loss\r\n\r\nAnd I am X-2 once again. Sigh, it has not been a good limited PTQ season for me.\r\n\r\nRound 5 was fun. He's white-green. Game 1 I'm losing badly to his early creatures, but then I hit Spiderwig giving Axegrinder fear (six damage), sac the Spiderwig to Fodder Launch one of his guys (+5 damage). End of his turn I footbottom the Spiderwig to give the Axegrinder fear again, dealing 17 damage in two turns to win from behind.\r\n\r\nGame 2 I get hit by the early aggro rush again and am unable to recover. I don't remember game 3, but my notes tell me hit was pretty bad for him as I took no damage at all.\r\n\r\nRound 5: 2-1 win\r\n\r\nRound 6, my opponent is a merfolk deck with Springleaf Drum, Falloysage and Veteran of the Depths, which gets annoying quick. I hold on for a long time in game 1 before succumbing to School tokens. Game 2 I keep a hand with Adder-Staff, 2 Lash Outs and another creature. I play the Adder-Staff and Lash Out his first two creatures, which I soon regret as his third play is a Veteran that goes all the way.\r\n\r\nRound 6: 0-2 loss\r\n\r\nSigh, I'm not even getting prizes anymore. I tick \"Drop\" on the result slip, then change my mind and cross it out. I want to play the last round to at least get some practice... hopefully my play skill can improve just a bit.\r\n\r\nRound 7: 0-2 loss. Bleah. I think my play was tight, but he just drew better cards. I remember he had an Epic Proportions that stopped my Lash Outs.\r\n\r\nA 3-4 finish, how terrible. Before this season I had actually envisioned myself as a decent limited player. Obviously, Lorwyn limited is hard, I need to do so much to improve my deck construction and technical play.\r\n\r\nNext: Morningtide Release Events? I won't be able to play in the prerelease since I'll be out of town...",

But I want to have a record so here we go. Same deck as\r\n   \r\n[\r\n    \r\nthe last time][1] \r\n   \r\n, except I removed the 2 grim harvests from the board and put in +2 sudden death (to improve the pickles matchup)\r\n\r\nRound 1: My opponent had a BUw Mannequin deck, splashing for O-Ring and Blink. He obviously put the deck together at the last minute though.\r\n\r\n2-0 win\r\n\r\nRound 2: Table 1! UW control, but he has bad draws both games.\r\n\r\n2-0 win\r\n\r\nRound 3: B/G Elves. Manny totally crushes aggro decks.\r\n\r\n2-0 win.\r\n\r\nRound 4: MGA. Wow, this matchup is even better than the last one. But I get a bad draw in game two and almost lose to a Spectral Force before topdecking into the Damnation.\r\n\r\n2-0 win.\r\n\r\nRound 5: A 4-0 start feels good. A friend warns me beforehand that my next opponent is U/B, but turns out he's wrong. He has Dreadship Reefs as storage lands so that's where the mistake was made, but my opponent was none other than MUP -- Monoblue Pickles. I win game one somehow and board in +2 sudden death, +3 Extirpate. I break the Pickles combo in both of the next two games, but sadly due to bad attacks and blocks on my part I still manage to lose to Teferi and an army of Factory Workers.\r\n\r\n1-2 loss.\r\n\r\nRound 6: Mannequin Mirror match here, but his build is new, as he shows me Ponder on the first turn. I lose game one to Profane Command. In game 2, 3 of the lands I draw are Faerie Conclaves... coincidentally he draws 3 Riftwing Cloudskates. I was behind on creatures and mana all day. Obviously, I need to figure out the mirror match... \r\n\r\n0-2 loss.\r\n\r\nCrash and burn after a good start, as usual.\r\n\r\nRound 7: U/W control. It's my turn to be insane with the Riftwing Cloudskates here, grabbing lots of tempo off my opponent while bashing with Ironfoots. I take it in 3.\r\n\r\n2-1 win.\r\n\r\nOne more win gets me into top eight... \r\n\r\nRound 8: R/G Big Mana. 90% of the deck is really easy for me to beat, after all it's creatures and burn, I'm removal and card advantage. I take the first game easily, but fumble on sideboarding -- I certainly wasn't aware of this matchup going in, so I had no idea. Bottle Gnomes? Extirpate? I just bring in 3 Vesuvan Shapeshifters to handle his Red Akroma and Hellkites. Game two, he shows me the other 10% of his deck that would give me fits: Chandra Nalar. My entire offense literally stops after Chandra takes down one creature and Incinerate knocks out my last one. I lose to the card disadvantage and proceed to search my board for answers to Chandra. I had none (I don't own any Pithing Needles sir), so I just sucked it up and decided to try for a fast aggro kill. I had a good hand too -- Faerie Conclave into suspended Cloudskate. But midgame he shows me another aspect of his deck -- land destruction. I get hit by Avalanche Riders and Mwonvuli Acid-Moss and he even shows me his sideboarded card: Rootgrapple! I have mana problems up to the end, and he even gets Chandra out again. I didn't get in a single point of damage for this game.\r\n\r\n1-2 loss.\r\n\r\nFinal record: 5-3, finishing 17. Not so bad I guess, considering I finished 25th the week before and 37th the week before that.  At this rate, I figure next week I'll be 8th or 9th. 😀\r\n\r\nNext: PTQ KL #3\r\n\r",

Not because I'm tired of it or anything, but because I've run out of people to play with. Unlike last year where we had enough players in the office to occasionally have an 8-man draft, this year most of the Magic players have either switched to WoW or moved to a different company/country.\r\n\r\nThere are only two of us seriously playing now, so our card pool has become so much smaller. That also means less preparation for constructed formats as it's harder to get serious playtesting done. Having a team and a shared card pool makes a huge difference. You can see this easily because so many of the players that repeatedly hit top 8 in the local tourneys are known members of a team.\r\n\r\nI'm not  sure how I'll proceed next year, but I'm not quitting. I love to play the game and will make do with what I have if I need to. I'm even contemplating playing in the Extended PTQs, although how I can gather the needed cards for that is still a mystery!",

It's just the sort of game I enjoy: challenging enough not to bore me but not so difficult that I give up in frustration and has enough extras to keep me coming back. A bit of a learning curve though, and probably not for casual gamers. I beat the normal campaign last week (just barely -- winning on Day 28 of a 28-day target), and I'm hoping I can finish the hard campaign before the release of Advance Wars: Days of Ruin next week.\r\n\r\nAlso, I was getting bored with my desktop wallpaper so I decided to look for some AW:DS wallpaper, but the official site (linked above) had apparently shoved them off somewhere in favor of Advance Wars: Days of Ruin stuff. Instead, I called up the wayback machine to get the official wallpapers. I might as well offer them here, since wallpapers for the game are hard to find: Advance Wars: Dual Strike official wallpapers.\r\n\r\nI ended up not using them after all though. My new desktop wallpaper is here \r\n   \r\n.\r\n\r\n [1]: http:// \"http://www.advancewars.com\"\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/awds\r",

But seeing as how this is a log, I need to note significant events that happened over the past weekend:\r\n\r\na. Saturday (Jan 12) -- Younger brother got married. Had to give a best man toast. It went well, but I got hit by birdshit.\r\n\r\nb. Sunday -- early morning road trip to Batangas, for a paternal-side family reunion. One of my uncles had built a new retirement home here. That side of the family doesn't get together often, so it's a special event.\r\n\r\nc. Sunday afternoon -- trip back to Metro Manila, stop by the wake of one of my maternal-side uncles who passed away last Friday\r\n\r\nd. Sunday evening -- mad rush to get back home so we could go to Mass at 9 PM. We had time to eat a few sausage rolls at pizza hut.\r\n\r\nThe theme that kept running through my mind the whole weekend was \"Family\" -- for obvious reasons. It amazed me how we went through a bunch of events encompassing a wide range of family affairs -- marriage, retirement, even death. The only thing missing was a newborn kid (we get those on the maternal side every year though). It reminds me that no matter what part of life we're going through -- happiness or sorrow, we can always rely on family to stand beside us and be there with us.\r\n\r\nI wish I had something more potent to say.",

But other people are, apparently. I got a comment on an old post I made about my job hunting days. Not only that, but the guy IM'd me asking to talk (I put my yahoo id on this site somewhere me). It's a bit strange, but I figured, why not? What I got from listening to him was that he was just extremely frustrated at how difficult it is to find a good job, so he was looking for people who had gone through similar experiences. He'd been unemployed for almost two months after quitting from a crappy job last November.\r\n\r\nI was going to be late, so I just gave him a few tips that I think could improve his chances of finding a good programming job. I thought I'd share them here as well. Note that I'm no expert on this or anything, just my opinions.

Whether this reflects the quality of those schools' graduates or just an inherent bias in recruitment, it is a real bias that graduates of other schools have to recognize and work to overcome. br / /embr / Looking back at the conversation this morning, I wonder if I did not come off as a bit elitist or something, focusing my advise on looking for \"good\" companies and all. I can afford to say all this now since I have a good, stable job, but I wonder how it would have felt hearing that advice when you're running out of cash and desperately needed work? I guess I have to say that if you really need to take a crappy job, then take a crappy job. But be aware that it's a crappy job, and figure out how you plan to climb out of it and find something better.\r\n/p\r\n\r\nI'd also like to reiterate that these are just my opinions -- I'm certainly no expert on job hunting, having been lucky enough to land a nice job after almost a year of being a bum and lazily submitting resumes. 😀\r\n\r",

So for our weekend trip to Albay to visit our new sister-in-law's family, I booked 3 two-way Cebu Pacific tickets for my brothers and myself. Our parents would take the bus since it was slightly cheaper and they didn't mind sleeping on the road. The other reason was that my two brothers had never ridden a plane before -- this would be their first time. First domestic flight for me as well. As expected, they were excited like giddy shoolboys, taking pictures on the way up the plane and leaning towards the window and all that.\r\n\r\nI suppose it was to be expected, but the airport in Legazpi was a far cry from the Manila one. Practically a strip of road labeled as the runway and a small building labeled a terminal. The flight itself was fine but obviously budget. I have been spoiled by PAL. And of course the view of Legazpi City was a lot more green than Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nOf course, there was Mayon, visible as soon as we descended from the clouds. Unfortunately the peak stayed hidden from us for the entire weekend, maybe another time. Still, Sunday morning we climbed Lignon Hill, which is a lot smaller than Mayon. We were hoping that by the time we finish the 30-minute walk to the top the peak would show itself. No such luck.\r\n\r\nThe walk upwards was... invigorating in a way. I have a newfound respect for slopes. The road we were walking on our way to the peak can't have been more than 30 degrees at its most difficult, yet my leg muscles felt dead tired before we were halfway up. Just shows how out of shape I was. The trip down was much faster of course.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the stay was mostly eating and shopping for _pasalubong.\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n  \r\nOf course, I suck at buying gifts for people so I'm glad I had a DS while everyone else was walking around the informal tiangge.\r\n\r\nOur parents dropped us off at the airport in time for the return flight. We checked in and sat down to wait. The rain outside started getting worse, and eventually there was a message that our flight is canceled. Boo! After asking around, I was told I'd get a full refund for the round trip flight. (So we got to fly to Albay for free) I called up my parents and asked them to get us bus tickets.\r\n\r\nAs I mentioned at the start, traveling by land sucks. It's hard to sleep, and I'm prone to motion-sickness on extended bus trips. Still, we made it back to Manila alive and well. I had a bit of a headache and some of the aforementioned nausea and hardly any sleep, as I expected...",

Living in a country such as this, where many people complain of extreme poverty, harsh economic conditions and the like, one can only wonder how we can celebrate the New Year so extravagantly.\r\n\r\nThese were the thoughts running through my mind as I watched the fireworks display by our neighbors in the subdivision. It's not like these guys are rich, they're middle class folk like me who probably balk at the cost of food or furniture or appliances but are now burning away thousands of pesos worth of fireworks, all for a single midnight of revelry. It's completely irrational yet understandably so. A typical Pinoy mentality, \"minsan lang naman, sa bagong taon lang.\"\r\n\r\nOur household has been light on fireworks for a long time. I think I was still in elementary school the last time we had any sort of pyrotechnics, we were always content to feast our eyes and ears on the neighborhood displays. What my father did one year, as midnight was approaching he brought out a tape recorder and made a recording of the New Year noise. On succeeding years we would bring out a large cassette player and play that tape a full volume, our own thrifty contribution to the din of welcoming the New Year.\r\n\r\nThe following are some superstitions we observe as the New Year chimes in:\r\n\r\n  Carrying coins in your pocket to ensure enough cash for the coming year\r\n  Throwing said coins through the doorway to ensure good fortune coming into the house\r\n  Having a basket of ten fruits (must be round, no bananas)\r\n  Jumping up and down at the stroke of midnight to grow taller during the year. (Not that we do this anymore, since we're all quite tall now)\r\n  Wearing red or polka dots (or both) clothes. No matter how old mind you. I don't think I've had a new red shirt in years.\r\n\r\nHm, not as many as I thought. 😀\r\n\r\nHappy New Year!\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by peng on 2008-01-05 07:32:01 +0000\r\ni have to give kudos to the noise recording. our family has often used pots\r\n  \r\nand pans to contribute in lieu of firecrackers.\r\n\r\nhmmm i've never seen you in polka dots.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2008-01-08 22:38:52 +0000\r\nI'm a guy; I've never worn polka dots.\r\n\r\nSadly, that recording was no longer around during the last New Year's Eve.

Terrible way to start the year. My own fault for bringing an outdated version of Mannequin to the tournament without even any testing. The meta is heavily Faeries and Elves it seems, and I think the Faerie matchup is bad, as I've never won a round against it (or my build is too inefficient). Elves matchup should be managable since they don't have tempo on me, but I was playing so badly I even lost to BG Tarmorack which I used to consider a good matchup. BGW Doran is strong -- I played 3 more games with him after I lost the first 2, I think he got the elf/birds into Doran start 4 out of 5 games. My deck has no easy way to deal with Doran, except for mass blocking.\r\n\r\nI'm thinking about building an entirely new deck now, and maybe actually do some testing (I just need to find people to test with... ) But if I were to keep going with Mannequin I think I need to try the Mind Stone build and lose the Grim Harvests. I also need more Pithing Needles as I keep randomly losing to manlands.\r\n\r\nNo Magic for me for the next two weeks though, due to personal matters.

As a stupid kid, I thought to myself, \"I wonder why the earth is shown as an oblate spheroid? When I go out with my parents it was obviously flat.\" (Paraphrasing a bit since when I was a kid I did not know the term \"oblate spheroid\")\r\n\r\nI have always had a curious  scientific mind of course, and I was able to come up with the only possible rational explanation: The upper half of the sphere must be the atmosphere, and the surface of the world must be inside the sphere on a plane near the equator. That would explain why Superman always flies up from the upper half of the sphere!\r\n\r\nIt seemed like a brilliant idea at the time.\r\n\r\n_\r\n  \r\n(I was thinking of making a mock-up drawing of the above hypothesis and claiming that I drew it when I was four.

No unlockables? Without the unlockables, I'm not inclined to play through the trial maps, since there's no incentive.

Of course, not one week after I got my copy, I'm done. It kept me up at nights and made me come in to work late; well worth it.\r\n\r\nTo those who are not familiar with the Ace Attorney games, it's hard to explain the appeal of the game; with all the thinking and reading to be done, it's definitely not exciting to watch. Anyone who's finished one of them knows what it is though. There's that feeling you get when you all the testimony and evidence finally come together, and you figure out how it was done but you still have to figure out how to prove it! \r\n\r\nDetailed review (and spoilers) follow.\r\n\r\n!--more--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nApollo Justice does not disappoint. Case one was the usual introductory case, with Winston Payne reprising his role as would-be slayer of rookie defense attorneys. Unlike previous AA games, case one is a bit longer this time, and leaves several questions that would not be answered until the fourth case.\r\n\r\nCase two and three are by far the best in the game. The plots are involving, and the mysteries take all your effort to decipher. Each case seems so simple but it's up to you to unmask the layers of deception and arrive at the truth.\r\n\r\nCase four is by far the weakest of the four cases, though still enjoyable.  My main problems with it are that it's (a) easy -- the path to uncover the truth is almost handed to you directly. I would have expected the last case to be the most difficult one; and (b) it doesn't satisfy all of the unanswered questions from case one.The most important unanswered question of course being: what happened to Maya? Really, we get to see Gumshoe _and Meekins (?!?) _again, but no Maya Fey? Oh well, I guess they had to leave something for future episodes.\r\n\r\nInevitably, one must compare Apollo to Phoenix. And Apollo's main problem here isn't the fact that PW already has 3 games under his belt or that he's still a rookie; his main problem is that he has no Edgeworth. No ruthless opposition who will eat him up if he makes a single mistake. Don't get me wrong, Gavin is fine. But he's too... nice. I don't have any other way to say it.\r\n\r\nAnd really, Apollo and Trucy turn out to be brother and sister? What is this, Star Wars? Well, ok, that one's not so bad.\r\n\r\nMr. Hat is awesome though. I'd love to get one of those.",

I also usually take one or two sheets of paper with me for meetings, supposedly to take notes (I never do). What usually happens with these papers is that I end up doodling.

It was not so much planned and maybe a bit more of an impulse buy. Something like a cellphone conversation with my brother who's standing in a store in Singapore pressuring me with \"Well? Should I buy one or not?\" I don't like pressure, so obviously I just said, \"Ok, whatever!\"\r\n\r\nThe inevitable question arises: which one is better, PSP or NDS? A friend asked me if they have different types of games, and I tell her that the NDS has more fun/casual games, while the PSP has more action-oriented stuff. So I guess it really depends on your taste.\r\n\r\nThe NDS is a fun piece of equipment and I had enjoyed it so much I bought a 2nd one when I saw a cheap price, yet lately the PSP has been garnering more attention from me. Two obvious reasons: (a) it's new and (b) Final Fantasy Tactics, most likely my favorite game of all time is available on the PSP with rewritten dialogue, added characters and added battles. Whether it's better than the NDS in the long run is hard to say, as Ace Attorney 4 -- Apollo Justice lies in the short distance.\r\n\r\nAlso, the presence of Street Fighter Alpha 3 Max on the PSP, along with the inevitable need to learn Tekken: Dark Resurrection \r\nso I can beat up the guys at work is a strong incentive to buy a 2nd PSP. But I'm not that rich/impulsive. Not yet.\r\n\r\nAfter the end of the lifetime of the PS2, I had been thinking that I may never again play console-style long games in the vein of Final Fantasy, but the PSP can possibly bring me back into that fold. PSX-style games on a handheld is huge, as one of the biggest drawbacks of playing on a console was needing to be stuck in front of a television to play those games. Amusingly, most of the games I have on the PSP now are ports/remakes of Playstation-era (or earlier!) games, which shows my preference for older games. I'm not even aware of what other games are available now -- FF Tactics takes up way too much of my mindspace.\r\n\r\nI need to go play some more...",

I'm talking the types of games that are not easily translatable into digital format and will probably remain so for quite a while.\r\n\r\nOne such game is known locally as \"Killer-killer\". Obviously a local name due to the Filipino's penchant for repeating words in a single term, I have no idea if it is known by other names elsewhere or if it exists outside this country at all. (As you can imagine, \"Killer-killer\" is not a very easy search term.) For the purposes of posterity, I will record the details of the game here.\r\n\r\nIn this game, a group of people sit around in a circular formation, such that each person can easily see each other's face. A good number of participants would be around 6-8, although more can play with a few rules adjustments (we played with around 15 people on the night in question).\r\n\r\nEach player is given a role, usually written on a scrap of paper and drawn randomly. The players don't know each others' roles. The following roles are available in the game:\r\n\r\n\"Killer\" -- the titular role obviously. The Killer's objective is to assassinate a particular other role, usually named the \"Judge\". The Killer kills people by winking at them silently, and tries to avoid getting caught by the Police. Other players who notice the Killer winking at them must declare that they have been killed. Once the Killer has killed his mark, the game ends and the killer wins.\r\n\r\n\"Judge\" -- the assassination mark, his only objective in the game is to stay alive. If the Judge is killed, the Killer wins and the Policeman loses.\r\n\r\n\"Police\" -- the law, his objective is to catch the Killer, either by catching him red-handed \"killing\" someone, or if the Killer attempts to \"kill\" the Police, the Police may immediately arrest him. Once the Police catches the Killer, the game ends.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor\" -- an important role, his objective is to \"Heal\" other people who have been \"killed\", by winking at them as well. The person who has been healed usually declares something like \"I'm alive again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Victim\" -- other players are usually assigned randomly-named roles but have no gameplay significance; their only purpose is to delay the Killer in his hunt for the mark.\r\n\r\nWhen playing with more people, the game can be balanced by adding more Killers and Policemen as needed.\r\n\r\nThe game is best played with a group of people who know each other well and are comfortable staring into each other's eyes. It's a game of concentration, bluffing and deception that is probably close to impossible to accurately translate into a digital game.\r\n\r\nAnd because I just now noticed that WordPress now allows me to tag posts, I will tag this one with a term I coined just now: \"meatspace-games\"\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by peng on 2008-02-15 07:17:40 +0000\r\ni LOVE killer-killer. i believe the doctor heals with a blink though.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2008-02-25 21:41:55 +0000\r\nI guess it depends on the particular set of rules that people know. I didn't\r\n  \r\neven remember how the game could handle 10 or more people until playing it\r\n  \r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBesides, blinking can happen involuntarily. Healing cannot. And making the\r\n  \r\ndoctor blink means the Policeman can make a mistake and catch the Doctor!",

For now, tourney report!\r\n\r\nRound 1, game 1: His deck was something like black, red and white. I remember seeing a Shard Volley, Shriekmaw, Eyeblight's Ending, and a Nameless Inversion. Surprisingly, I still manage to get out Drowner + 2 Schoolmaster + Merrow Commerce. The first time I tap the Commerce to mill him, he asks me why I'm tapping the enchantment. I keep getting that question for the rest of the day. He reads the cards, and scoops.\r\n\r\nRound 1, game 2: We both keep six-handers, but mine has a lot more gas. He's stuck on a single mountain and I'm attacking with a couple of dorks. He tries to stay alive by saccing his lone land to Shard Volley, but I have the Spellstutter Sprite.\r\n\r\nWe play an extra round for fun, but I still take it with damage, although he did put up more of a fight.\r\n\r\nRound 2, game 1: I win by lib-death again. Needed only a single Schoolmaster this time.\r\n\r\nRound 2, game 2: Turn four he plays Boldwyr Heavyweights. I search out and play Guile. He swings for eight. I topdeck Weight of Conscience. He manages to kill Guile (duh... Final Sting Faerie). I manage to draw him again.\r\n\r\nRound 3, game 1: I overcommit the Drowner and the Schoolmaster + a couple of other guys, and he shows me an Incendiary Command. Feast of Footbottomgives him back some elves and I scoop to damage.\r\n\r\nRound 3, game 2: We race about evenly, but then I swing with five creatures; he thinks he's only taking eight, but I show him the Swell of Courage for the win.\r\n\r\nRound 3, game 3: My notes tell me I dealt no damage this game. I was basically behind all game, and I was at one when he drew the Incendiary Command again.\r\n\r\nRound 4, game 1: My opponent asks the players on the adjacent table and ask if I'm really allowed to tap it for Drowner. They nod and look at the Drowner, the Schoolmaster and the Commerce and advise him to scoop.\r\n\r\nRound 4, game 2: I was well in control here, locking down the board with Stonybrook Angler. He used a Warren Pilferers to champion into a Boggart Mob. I brought out Guile. He swings with mob, I figure if Guile blocks, he'll just get back the Mob with Pilferers and recast, wasting his mana. Guile blocks the Mob to kill it. Blunder -- I had forgotten he had a Shriekmaw in the yard, which he promptly gets to dispose of my Incarnation. I lose to the wave of goblins and quickly shuffle up for game 3.\r\n\r\nRound 4, game 3: Anticlimactic, as he drew no gas and all lands while I was beating with 2 1/1s.\r\n\r\nFinal record: 3-1. Three packs as prize, plus the foil Earwig. Not a bad way to start off Limited this year.",

Instead of just enjoying the holiday watching DVDs that is.\r\n\r\nJust something I posted on a certain mailing list a few days ago:\r\n\r\n I find it hard to believe that ousting GMA now would lead to any true change. We've seen what the countless political episodes have exposed: corruption at almost every level of government, both the executive and legislative branches beholden to bribery and extortion. The problems in our government are systemic in nature, and it would take more than the ouster of a single person to effect any meaningful change. Even if we were to find someone \\with good intentions\\ to replace the president, he's still likely to be swallowed up by the system.\r\n  \r\n !--more--\r\n \r\n \r\n  \r\n I don't know where the whole ZTE debacle will end; maybe they'll be able to oust GMA, maybe not. But what I fear is that we are finding ourselves trapped in a cycle of ousting bad leaders, and with each round our apathy for corruption only grows deeper. If people rose up against GMA and things remained the same afterwards, more and more of us would just give up against the seemingly irreversible tide of corruption that pervades the government.\r\n \r\n It's a sad and cynical view to have of our government, but I find more and more that I just don't care what happens to GMA. It's not that I've given up hope in our govt, but I do not yet see any light at the end of that dark tunnel. Anyway, the Filipino nation is more than just the government, and there are other ways we can support our country than by meddling in politics.\r\n\r\nI have to admit that I posted this there hoping to incite some discussion and find out where the list members (who by definition are mostly smart middle-class people) stand. I was not disappointed, but the discussion seems to have petered out at this point. Nothing has happened yet, I guess everyone's adopting a wait-and-see attitude.\r\n\r\nMore thoughts:\r\n\r\nEDSA Revolution (1986) -- I was of course too young to remember the events... except for the fact that my favorite cartoons kept getting cancelled for some reason. But what I've read tells a story of a time of turbulence and despair such that there was no other way for people to regain their individual freedoms than to take to the streets and claim it back. I cannot personally attest to the factuality of the such narrations, since history is of course written by the winners. Hence, I do not presume to compare the current time to the events of twelve years ago.\r\n\r\nEDSA 2 (2001) -- Whereas EDSA 1 was an outcry to regain lost freedoms, EDSA 2 was an outcry against corruption. Personally, I did not participate in EDSA 2. Sure, at some point I felt the fever, that wave of indignation rushing through the nation when Erap's goons tried to prevent impeachment, and I _almost _\r\n  \r\nwent there. (Of course I didn't on account of being lazy.) But afterwards, I felt not too satisfied with the outcome. Maybe it's just because I'm Lawful Good, but somehow I was not entirely happy that the institutions established by law (impeachment) failed us and we had to go to the streets again to correct the course of our beleaguered country. But I went with it, I figured that we would learn from this mistake and be more vigilant, and we would never have to do it again.\r\n\r\nFast forward and it's now seven years later. And people are saying that we're back in the same place. Stories of massive corruption abound, witnesses being threatened, media being warned on what they can and cannot cover, massive bribes distributed to lawmakers, et cetera. And apparently, some people want to do it all again. Go back into the streets and demand resignation. Our institutions can no longer be trusted, they say. Impeachment doesn't work, we have no other choice. Another conjugal dictatorship, another midnight cabinet, the control the police and Congress, et cetera. Another revolution. Another shortcut.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how they imagine GMAs forced resignation would help our country. Their plan right now probably looks something like this:\r\n\r\nForce GMA to resign\r\n\r\n???\r\n\r\nProfit! Er... corruption ends!\r\n\r\nI'm not yet convinced that GMA's resignation is a moral imperative. And it seems that a large number of citizens are not yet convinced either. I'm not sure if it's possible for the current crop of personalities to convince me; I'm not even sure what they are offering in exchange.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I want our institutions to work. I want change to be effected without having to go out on the streets every time. I want the Senate hearings to push through and conclude, for legislation to be enacted to remove whatever loopholes allow the abuses of the GMA administration. I want charges brought before the courts (surely at the very least Abalos can be charged), and I want the law to take it's course. I want the people to be educated so that we can elect better leaders.\r\n\r\nWe have a government for a reason. While citizens have their part to play, we shouldn't have to go out on the streets to have change. Doing so is an indication of failure not only on the part of the president, but on all our institutions -- the Senate and the courts included.\r\n\r",

Of course the archetypes from LLL still apply, such as UB Faeries, Uw Merfolk, etc.  Mono-W Kithkin, which used to suck in Triple-LOR, got a good dose of commons such as the 2W 2/2/ Flying Reinforce 2 and the Order of the Golden Cricket. B/u Rogues is fun, the only problem being that your guys are so small (Festercreep really hurts!). And R/G Warriors... that archetype has existed since triple-LOR and just gets the Banneret, Battle-Axe and the Paragon as support.\r\n\r\nThe art of Boldwyr Heavyweights is really amusing.",

Actually I find the Dolphin file manager significantly better than the old one.\r\n\r\nBad:\r\n\r\n  Window controls are still buggy, combo boxes occasionally are not working correctly\r\n  Limited options for the desktop wallpaper -- I liked the \"Slideshow\" option in KDE3.5\r\n  Ctrl+Alt+D keybinding for \"Show Desktop\" not set by default. (It was enabled by default in KDE 3.5 for Kubuntu)\r\n  Everything on the desktop is now a widget. That includes the start menu, the panel, the system tray, and icons on the desktop. This isn't a bad thing per se, but I got confused by the icons on the desktop being widgets. They have some widget controls around them that allow me to rotate or remove them from view. I was like \"Eh? Why would I want to rotate the icons one-by-one? And will clicking this X thing delete the file?\" And the icons don't have the usual context menu for files. Apparently it's designed so that the icons on the desktop are not treated as files inside a file manager. I realize it's intended to be a completely different paradigm, but it just threw me off.\r\n  Occasional slowdown. Sometimes when moving my mouse over the Task Manager widget, the tooltips for each active window all appear together without fading out appropriately.\r\n  Konqueror is still not a very good web browser. And Firefox does not look good in KDE4. (In KDE3.5 I had installed the package that allows GTK apps to use QT so it looks ok there. Not sure if something similar already exists for KDE4)\r\n  I don't like the Oxygen window decorator.\r\n\r\nIn general, it looks nice and is promising, but I'm not sure I would be ready to have it for everyday use. I'll switch back to KDE3.5 after posting this, and will maybe try KDE4 again after the next Kubuntu release to see how it's improved.\r\n\r\n [1]: /files/uploads/2008/02/screenshot.thumbnail.png\r",

This was one of the aggro matchups my scant playtesting focused on, so I already knew it was a beating. The Windborn Muses in the board were my reaction to the bad matchup vs this deck and Faeries. They weren't in Peebles original decklist which made top 8 at the SCG 5k, but he recommended the tech in the forums. Still it wasn't very effective against this particular build, due to 3\r\n   \r\nCloak and Dagger\r\n   \r\nwhich he just put on a single attacker with Fear. In hindsight, I should have boarded in at least one Moat as well.\r\n\r\nAlso, I should probably learn to mulligan better. I kept a suboptimal hand in game one and missed land drops on turns three and four, and only had a lens on turn five.\r\n\r\nSideboarding: -3 Mirror Entity, -3 Bonded Fetch, +3 Windborn Muse, +3 Aven Riftwatcher.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 2: 2-0 win vs Snow Red\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nThis matchup is so one-sided, I see no way for the red deck to win this matchup especially if I draw Venser which I did both games.\r\n\r\nI did the Reveillark combo in game 1, which is the only time I was able to for the entire tournament.\r\n\r\nSideboarding: -1 Riftwing Cloudskate, -1 Mirror Entity, -1 Bonded Fetch, +3 Aven Riftwatcher\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 3: 2-0 win vs Monowhite Kithkin\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nI stabilized at 5 life in game one and at 4 life in game two. Scary, but the UW deck easily gains control. He made a bad decision to O-Ring my 2nd turn Prismatic Lens in game 2, when I had the Moat two turns later. I only had a Mulldrifter on offense, but since I had both the Magus and Teferi's Moats on the board, he just scooped.\r\n\r\nSideboarding: -3 Riftwing Cloudskate, +2 Teferi's Moat, +1 Magus of the Moat\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 4: 1-2 loss vs Monoblue Merfolk\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nThis was heartbreaking. The build was a rogue deck that worked surprisingly well against Reveillark-Blink. Curse that\r\n   \r\nLord of Atlantis\r\n   \r\nand his islandwalk! I also made a mistake in sideboarding here since I should have brought in the Moats, instead of the do-nothing Riftwatchers. I need to make better sideboarding choices.\r\n\r\nSideboarding: -1 Riftwing Cloudskate, -1 Mirror Entity, -1 Bonded Fetch, +3 Aven Riftwatcher\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 5: 2-1 win vs Monogreen Aggro\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nI lost game one to a\r\n   \r\nStonewood Invocation\r\n   \r\n(Really? Who plays that?). Game two, he just scooped after seeing me play both types of Moats. Game three he doesn't have the Llanowar Elf on turn one, and I have him under control early. He tries playing\r\n   \r\nSpectral Force\r\n   \r\nfor three turns in a row, I get virtual time walks from Venser + Blink.\r\n\r\nSideboarding: -3 Riftwing Cloudskate, -1 Mirror Entity, -1 Bonded Fetch, +2 Teferi's Moat, +1 Magus of the Moat, +2 Sower of Temptation\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 6: 1-2 loss vs Monoblack Rogues\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nGame one I lose to the bad matchup obviously. Game two he keeps a one-lander with like 5 one-drops, but I show him the Windborn Muse on turn three, and a second one two turns later. Game three is a heartbreaker, and reminds me that I really need to be careful with my plays under pressure as I tend to give away games that I should have won.\r\n\r\nHis board is like six ground guys, including Stinkdrinker Bandit, plus Marsh Flitter.\r\n\r\nI'm at 4 life. My board is Magus of the Moat and Body Double (copying Mulldrifter). and a Cloudskate. I had spent most of the game burning my two blinks on the Body Double to draw into the combo so that I could win despite my precarious situation. I already have the Entity in the yard, along with every other possible creature except for the Reveillark and the Body Double. Finally, with 10 mana available, I draw into the Reveillark.\r\n\r\nSince I'm an aggro player by nature, I know how to smell victory, and drawing the Reveillark told me I could win on that turn. So I went ahead and evoked it. Then I looked through the graveyard to get two guys I realized\r\n   \r\n_\r\n    \r\nI couldn't combo while the Body Double was still in play!\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n   \r\nMentally, I panicked, and decided to just get the Entity and Mulldrifter, and hope to draw into the last Momentary Blink (to turn my Body Double into a Reveillark). Instead, I drew a Prismatic Lens. Not mindful of the consequence (since I was supposedly still safe behind the moat), leaving 3 mana untapped. Next turn I could use Venser on the Body Double and win the game.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nOf course, he top decks into the Nameless Inversion, killing the Magus and taking me out of the tournament in one swing.\r\n\r\nTerrible... so many things gone wrong. I should have reserved a blink to protect the Moat. If I hadn't played the lens, the Mirror Entity could have protected the Moat. Or I could have Venser'ed. I also evoked the Reveillark purely out of instinct, thinking something like I could bring back Cloudskate+ Entity, bounce the Body Double, recast it and win the game, but I wouldn't have had enough mana for that.\r\n\r\nLack of experience with the deck was partly to blame, since I didn't have the instinct to recognize that I couldn't combo with the Body Double in play. Still, I need to address this lack of thinking-through my plays since I often turns wins or draws into losses unnecessarily.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nFinal record: 3-3-Drop\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n**\r\n    \r\nAfterthoughts:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nI found it hard getting back into the groove of a whole-day tournament after being out of it for so long, especially playing with a new deck. In the middle of the tournament I found myself so tired and wondering why I'm even still playing competitively given that I make so many bad plays. With so many other things vying for my time I could easily justify quitting tournament magic for a while. But that last game was a bit invigorating, it made me wake up to a challenge to improve my game. I'll be back next week for the last Trials; and for the City Champs as well.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Cloak and Dagger\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lord of Atlantis\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Stonewood Invocation\r",

He swings with six power in the air, I block with my guys to get everyone killed. Big mistake, since he's the Active Player, my trigger resolves first and he gets to Sower whatever I bring back; I bring in two Body Doubles copying Reveillarks; the second mistake was not realizing I that I had a Blink in the yard, could have prevented the Sower trigger and brought back two more guys, a large enough swing that would have been enough to win me the game that I eventually lost.\r\n\r\nAnyway, still unsure if I will play this deck at City Champs, as it's very tiring...",

Actually I'm writing this post just so that I can claim to post on the internet from airports.\r\n\r\nI am of course flying back to Manila after a short 3-day visit to Hong Kong. People always ask me where I plan to go while in HK, even though I always come here to work. It's even worse this time, as I flew in Sunday evening, attending a three-day seminar until Wednesday, working during the evenings then flying back Thursday morning. Not much time to do anything really.\r\n  \r\n!--more--\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, I wouldn't want to take lunch at the airport because of the excessive price, but the check-in took a bit longer than I expected so I wasn't able to grab some food outside. The second mistake was ordering a fried noodle dish. It would have been fine if I was sufficiently skilled with chopsticks, but as it is I can only food I can manage relatively well with chopsticks are large pieces of meat. And fried noodles are served all bunched up together and they aren't straightforward to chew through, hence whenever I shove some into my mouth with the chopsticks, I feel like I would be unable to stop until I swallow it all (or choke, whatever). Eventually I just give up with about a third of the noodles still in the bowl. The flight will have some food anyway.\r\n\r\nWhenever I'm bored and traveling I tend to think of random insane scenarios that I act out in my head. Examples:\r\n\r\nWhile watching a 15-year old Chinese kid struggle with a Rubik's Cube on the MTR:\r\n\r\nMe (stands up and walks over to the kid, extending hand): \"Give me that!\" (Grabs the cube and solves it in ten seconds flat, and immediately jump off at Central station while the rest of the passengers watch in awe)\r\n\r\n&#8212;\r\n\r\nWhile looking for a place to eat at the airport:\r\n\r\nMe (walks up to a random Chinese woman): Hi, I'm hungry.\r\n\r\nChinese woman: Eh?\r\n\r\nMe (making hand-to-mouth signs): Hungry! Give me some food!\r\n\r\n&#8212;\r\n\r\nLuckily, I never do any of these.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by noems on 2008-04-04 15:46:23 +0000\r\nmay i ask why do you always go to hongkong?

Having to hit an extra key just to use \"Home\" or \"End\"? For some reason, PrintScreen and CapsLock keys are higher priority than Home and End, meaning you don't need to use \"Fn\" to access them. Do people not use Ctrl+Shift+Home and Ctrl+Shift+End all the time? I'm sure a lot of developers do. Whenever I'm on this laptop and need to use Home or End, I mentally pronounce \"Fn\" as a seven-letter word starting with \"F\" and ending with \"ing\".\r\n\r\nI like laptops, but keyboards need to improve in some way. My suggestion? Remove the trackpad and have an extra row for those keys that you would have relegated to \"Fn\" status.  While using the keyboard is around 200 times more productive than using the mouse (citation needed), the mouse is around 200 times more productive than the trackpad.\r\n\r\nWho designs these interfaces anyway? Do Mac users have similar issues?\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Ovidiu C. on 2008-04-30 20:53:13 +0000\r\nI have a huge bad @$$ Microsoft Natural Keyboard 4000, but I rarely use the\r\n  \r\narrow keys, insert, delete, home, end, page up/down etc. I would rather keep\r\n  \r\nmy fingers on the home row and Vim is perfect for that.",

I stopped for a few minutes and watched. I realize a lot of people would probably find watching Scrabble games boring, seeing only two geeky people spelling out words at random, not even making any sense. But watching the Scrabble games brought me back to a time when I didn't have the internet to keep me up at nights.\r\n\r\nScrabble is a game close to my heart, me and my brother Kerwin practically grew up with the game.\r\n  \r\n!--more--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\nMy grandfather often played games at home with my uncles, often with small bets of ten or twenty pesos. I remember as a kid I was so envious of a notched-tile board that my grandfather had bought, while we kids played with our cheap and dingy locally-made board. There was one summer where me, Kerwin and my cousin played Scrabble basically every day, sometimes with our uncle who often had free time. We learned a lot of new words of course, we learned strategy, we complained about someone taking far too long to play (usually my cousin).\r\n\r\nI remember often abusing the fact that we played with a challenge penalty. To non-Scrabble players: that means that if you think your opponent has played an illegal word, you may challenge it, and he loses the turn if it's not in the dictionary. But if it does appear in the dictionary, you have lost the challenge and must forfeit your own turn. It added a nice bluffing subgame: I would consciously favor words that I knew to be correct but looked ridiculous -- after all, words like \"VUV\" and \"ZOA\" were allowed in the usual Scrabble dictionaries. I usually did this trick to my cousin who was older than me. Kerwin was younger so for some reason he just trusted what his brother would play.\r\n\r\nI remember being really excited the first time I won against my uncle; he had been the most difficult opponent I had ever played at that point, and it seemed like such an accomplishment.\r\n\r\nIf you knew me during college, you may know that I was a pretty good Scrabble player. I took the PE class (easy 1.0! although of course PEs don't count against the GWA), played in two or three University-wide tournaments, and won one or two. Well, memory tells me I won at least one, but the number of extra Scrabble sets I still keep to this day tell me it was probably two.\r\n\r\nI do remember that at a certain point I was even thinking about competing in National or International tournaments. Alas, if only Scrabble tournaments were held at the same regularity that Magic tournaments are, I might have a completely different (and much less expensive) geeky hobby right now.\r\n\r\nThese days I still manage a game every so often with either my brothers or my mother, so the extra scrabble boards go unused. We've also played a lot online, Scrabulous is an excellent waste of time. It's sad that Milton-Bradley, the company that owns the Scrabble trademark, is suing Scrabulous over this when Scrabulous has made Scrabble so popular online, especially over Facebook.\r\n\r\nWatching the Scrabble tournament today for a few minutes, I realized I wish I had known about the tournament; I may be rusty but I could probably still put up a fight. And I also remembered one of the great things about Scrabble: anyone can play -- the tournament had young and old, men and women alike, fighting for dominance over the space a few tiles and a few words. Maybe someday I can compete in that world again.\r\n\r",

I didn't want to play a UW control deck for five rounds, so we go Mana Ramp.\r\n   \r\n!--more--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 1: BG Elves\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nGame one goes long, he stalls the ground with a lot of elves while I'm holding him off with Walls and Colossi. I'm at 9 and a Troll Ascetic with a Warhammer has gotten him to 36. After burning 3 Harmonizes I finally get a Sulfurous blast and wipe his side, going down to six. Unfortunately, the the Ascetic and 2 Treetop Villages survived, making it too dangerous to counterattack. I already have a Disintegrate in hand, so I just need to wait for the Hostility to win the game with. Unfortunately, he draws Profane Command before I draw Hostility.\r\n\r\nGame two he has no blockers on turn two so I foolishly send in the Treetop, which of course gets sent to the &#8216;yard via Nameless Inversion. I stall on land afterwards and never recover. Funny, I remember another Green player making the exact same mistake against me on turn 2 when I used to play Mannequin -- I need to learn from my opponents' mistakes as well.\r\n\r\n0-2 games, 0-1 matches (Not a good start obviously)\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 2: UBW Hakkon Reanimator\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nI'm at table 100! The opponent's deck is fun with lots of neat graveyard interactions. Unfortunately, the power level is not that high, and I win in 2.\r\n\r\n2-2 games, 1-1 matches\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 3: G/W Mana Ramp\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nGame one I gain a ton of life from triple Condemn; He plays Crovax and next turn he casts Primal Command for Akroma, Angel of Wrath. I untap and play Hostility. Crovax blocks and returns to hand., taking him from 27 life to 25. He untaps and plays Akroma. End of his turn, cast Incinerate, creating 3 3/1 tokens. Cast Skred to kill Wall of Roots (blocker). My turn, untap, draw. Incinerate, creating 3 more tokens. Disintegrate for 5, creating 5 more tokens. Attack with 11 tokens + Hostility, 39 damage on the board and only Akroma as the blocker... nick deck.\r\n\r\nGame two... my notes make it appear that I just played a fatty and pummelled him to death.\r\n\r\n4-2 games 2-1 matches\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 4: UB Faeries\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nWow! This is the matchup I was prepared for! I should totally dominate this.\r\n\r\nObviously, my lack of play testing killed me here.\r\n\r\nGame one I cleared his Faeries with spot removal, then when the coast was clear, inexplicably decided to hardcast a Cloudthresher (\"Now it's my turn to attack!\") Of course he played the Sower, and I was out of burn. Trying to go aggro when I was obviously the control in this matchup... \"Misassignment of role = game loss\"\r\n\r\nGame two I played a bit better, and the game went long, but I still lost to a misplay. I needed to play a 3 damage burn spell so that Bitterblossom would kill him, and having both Incinerate and Sulfurous Blast in my hand, I went for the greedy blast, hoping to clear away the Faeries on board as well. Of course I then got hit by an Rune Snag that I could've paid for if I had played the Incinerate instead! I got too greedy and didn't think it through... clearing the Faeries on board wouldn't have mattered as long as I won the game.\r\n\r\n4-4 games 2-2 matches\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 5: UB Mannequin\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nEasy, I win in two games. Nothing of note happened. Even when I was playing Mannequin before I knew Mana Ramp wasn't a good matchup.\r\n\r\n6-4 games, 3-2 matches\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 6: BR Goblins\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nAfter hitting me with the trigger off Earwig Squad, he commented that my build was very unusual obviously anti-Faerie. Luckily, the deck is good against BR Goblins as well. Between Colossus, Sulfurous Blast and Pyroclasm out of the board, he doesn't have much chance.\r\n\r\nI so wanted to board in the Heavyweights here, given that I hadn't had a chance to play them yet, but I was afraid that he might have had either Gargadon or Shriekmaw.\r\n\r\n8-4 games, 4-2 matches\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 7: UB Faeries\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n   \r\nI play a lot better this time, and the maindeck Spectral Force goes to work, tearing across Bitterblossom Tokens like nobody's business.\r\n\r\n10-4 games, 5-2 matches. I haven't played a game 3 yet, and with two more wins I still have a very small chance to make top 8!\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 8: UB Faeries\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nMy third Faeries matchup today. I easily win game one due to the 6 board sweepers in the deck. I must have had some sort of fattie as I have a record of him going from 17 to 7 to 0.\r\n\r\nGame two I mulligan to five and fall to 2 life before I can muster a good defense. At two life, Threshers and Blasts are useless, so on to game three.\r\n\r\nMy first game three! We trade blows and go long, eventually I'm at 7 and he's at 8. I have six lands and am holding both Incinerate and Disintegrate, so I can kill him by EOT 3 damage and Sorcery-speed 5 damage, but I'm afraid of Rune Snag so I wait. Eventually, he resolves a Mistbind Clique that teams up with Conclaves to kill me. After the game he tells me that he boarded out the Rune Snags -- apparently it's a common tactic vs Mana Ramp, something I would have known if I had bothered to do any research on the deck at all.\r\n\r\n11-6 games, 5-3 matches\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 9: UW Reveillark\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nMy opponent and I knows each other from prior tournaments and we're both known to have used &#8216;Lark before so he assumes it's the mirror. Sadly, it's actually a good matchup for him and I just shake my head as I play turn one Treetop Village. As expected, the Village gets Vensered and Cloudskated before it could do anything useful, and my attempts to Thresher to clear his side of the board are only met with a Pact of Negation. I shake my head and shuffle up for game two.\r\n\r\nFinally I get to use my anti-Lark sideboard. I knew coming in that Mana Ramp generally lost to &#8216;Lark, so I packed ten sideboard cards for the matchup: 4 Cryoclasm, 3 Extirpate and 3 Void. I don't remember how I boarded, but I reduced my creature count (expecting Moat), keeping only Hostility among my fatties.\r\n\r\nAnd of course... it didn't go well. I resolved a Void, named five and he showed me his hand full of 2s: Rune Snags, Blinks and Remove Souls. He eventually draws into two Larks, and I don't have the Extirpates to fight back.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nFinal record:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n11-8 games, 5-4 matches, finished #95 (won Extended Art Imperious Perfect)\r\n\r\nUnderperformed again as usual. Of course, given that I came up with the decklist the night before and had zero playtesting I suppose it's not so bad. And given the 3 faerie decks I faced I don't think I would have done as well with the Lark deck. This deck is workable but could use a bit of tuning. (Obviously the Heavyweights are such a joke and have to go... ) People don't usually expect the unusually high amount of burn, and I even have the ability to deal upwards of 30 damage with the Hostility combo, so it's pretty flexible. I'll see what I can do to improve the Lark matchup...",

Just for fun, I'll log my progress here.\r\n   \r\n!--more--\r\n\r\nWhere do I start? I'm actually pretty clueless about web design in general, but I figure I can rough it out. I decide that I need to start by choosing colors. Yes, websites have colors, and despite the fact that I couldn't figure out matching shirts and pants to save my life, I'm going to try to pick a decent color scheme for a website.\r\n\r\nExcept I didn't. I cheated instead. I knew that Excel 2007 came with predefined sets of color themes, so I fired up Excel and chose from one of the available color schemes.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-485\" title=\"screenshot077\" src=\"/files/uploads/2008/04/screenshot077-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" / \r\n\r\nI figure it's okay to cheat here and there because I'm a newb. Excel 2007 offers me several color schemes; since my favorite color in Magic is green, I decide it's going to be a green-themed website layout and choose the colors from the default green-type theme.\r\n\r\nI think about how I would layout the page. I could open up an HTML editor and draft a few sample layouts, but instead I do something a bit easier. I already have Excel open, so I draft the layout using Excel. We sometimes use Excel at work for prototyping web forms; using it to prototype layouts isn't so far a stretch. I decide on a 3-column layout with varying shades of green and put in some sample text of what I imagine each column would contain.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-486\" title=\"screenshot078\" src=\"/files/uploads/2008/04/screenshot078-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"(click to view larger image)\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" / \r\n\r\nWhen a reader comes to the site, I want him to read the most recent article first, so I place the latest post content in the leftmost column. I imagine that I can figure out later how to make only one post appear there. After the most recent article, I want the user to see a list of the recent posts, so I put in the second column where he can quickly scan it. In the last column I'll place the \"About\" stuff, etc.\r\n\r\nNext, I open up a text editor. I know that most \"pro\" web designers recommend the use of CSS for layouts so I try out the 3-column layout, using 3 floating divs inside a container div. It looks fine in Firefox, but it doesn't look so hot in IE.\r\n   \r\n_\r\n    \r\n(See screenshot for details)\r\n    \r\n\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-487\" title=\"screenshot076\" src=\"/files/uploads/2008/04/screenshot076-150x150.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" / \r\n\r\nIf I had more time, I would've looked up how to fix this using CSS, but I was impatient and still had the \"newb\" excuse so I just made a mockup page using a table layout instead. [TODO: Screenshot]\r\n\r\nNext I need an image to place in the header area, preferably artwork from a green Magic card. The best place to look is the official website, so I browse over to MagicTheGathering.com and look over the recent entries in the \"Wallpaper of the Week\" feature. I settle on the card art for Winnower Patrol.\r\n\r\nI download the 1280&#215;1024 version of the wallpaper and open it up in the Gimp Image Editor. I crop a smaller area that matches the header size and paste it unto an image of my mockup to get a feel of what it looks like.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-483\" title=\"Image Mockup\" src=\"/files/uploads/2008/04/screenshot-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" / \r\n\r\nThe Winnower Patrol image fits surprisingly well, at least it looks that way to me.\r\n\r\nNow that I have a rough layout, I want to start working on the WordPress side. I already have a local WordPress installation, so to make things easier I export the content of the Roy on Magic site and import it into my local test installation.\r\n\r\nNext I go into my local wordpress folder and create a copy of the default theme. I name the new folder \"green\" -- I'll think of a creative name for the theme later.\r\n\r\nI go into the folder and wonder where I should start. I'm a bit familiar already with the files so I know that to create the basic layout I have to modify the ff:\r\n\r\na. styles.css -- I delete the contents and paste in the styles from my HTML mockup\r\n\r\nb. header.php -- similarly, I copy-paste the header code from my HTML mockup into the header file. Additionally, I have to change the hardcoded \"Roy on Magic\" to ?php bloginfo(&#8216;name'); ? and the description to ?php bloginfo(&#8216;description'); ?\r\n\r\nc. index.php -- this is the page that renders the posts. I'm not yet too familiar with how WP does the post retrieval, so I just copy the table row from the HTML mockup and then put in the default post generation code.\r\n\r\nd. sidebar.php -- similar to index, I just copy the default sidebar content first and place it inside the HTML mockup tags. I also paste the third column contents from the mockup into the currently empty third column.\r\n\r\ne. footer.php -- similarly merged from mockup and the default template.\r\n\r\nI login to WordPress and change the theme to \"green\" and check it out in the browser:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-484\" title=\"screen5\" src=\"/files/uploads/2008/04/screen5-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" / \r\n\r\nIt now looks like the layout I planned! (Surprise!) Now I need to cleanup the content so that only the parts I want are displayed in each column. This is going to take a lot more delving into the innards of WordPress and PHP though, so I'll continue this next time.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/magic/\r\n [2]: /files/uploads/2008/04/screenshot077.jpg\r\n [3]: /files/uploads/2008/04/screenshot078.jpg\r\n [4]: /files/uploads/2008/04/screenshot076.jpg\r\n [5]: http://www.wizards.com/default.asp?x=mtgcom/arcana/1517\r\n [6]: /files/uploads/2008/04/screenshot.png\r",

        "content": "---\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2008-04-29 05:58:00\r\ntags:\r\nMagic the Gathering\r\ntitle: Deck Building for an Unknown Metagame\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2008/04/deck-building-for-an-unknown-metagame/\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis coming weekend is the release of Shadowmoor. As with any new set coming in, this means a new environment with an unknown metagame, and is especially true for the large set Shadowmoor. It’s an opportunity for those of us who believe we have some modicum of deck-building skills. I plan to be playing Standard on Saturday, one day after set release so I will try to build a deck to take advantage of the wide open field.\r\n\r\n!--more--\r\n\r\nOf course it’s not entirely true that the metagame is unknown. We have the carry-over decks from the past metagame to consider. And from there we try to predict what the opponents for the upcoming metagame are.\r\n\r\nFor this exercise, I will consider two decks to be the primary \"prey\":\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Blue-black Faeries, the undisputed best deck of pre-SHA standard. A lot of players have Faerie decks, and with the short time frame between SHA release and the Saturday tournament, it’s reasonable to assume many will simply carry over their Faerie decks with minimal modifications \r\n  Red decks of all varieties, another popular choice pre-SHA, gains a powerful host of uncommon with the coming set; given how many people were looking for Tattermunge Maniacs and Flame Javelins during the past two weekend tournaments, it’s reasonable to assume there’s gonna be a good number of shards being volleyed this Saturday. \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\nThose decks are the enemy; having determined that I look at the current pool I have available to determine what options are open to me. I look over the SHA cards available, including those from friends who played in the Prerelease. I see that we already have four Wooded Bastions, 2 Wilt-Leaf Lieges and a full playset of Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers and Kitchen Finks. I’ve always been a fan of midrange, so my first plan is to go White-Green.\r\n\r\nThinking about the cards, the obvious creatures are the 3-drops: Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers and Kitchen Finks. Both of these are great against red decks, often requiring 2-for-1 exchanges, and in the case of Kitchen Finks it’s potentially a 4-for-1 exchange (trade with two creatures, and the four life is equivalent to two cards from the red deck). For red decks, their main problem is running out of steam. These 3 drops make it much harder for them to have enough burn left over to take you from 20 to 0.\r\n\r\nSo we start with:\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Kitchen Finks\r\n\r\nGiven that, we can toss in Wilt-Leaf Lieges for the bonus. I only have 2, and am unsure if I can acquire more before Saturday, so we go with two. To compensate and further cement the red deck matchup, I can put in 3 Primal Commands. Against red decks, 7 life is like 3 cards, and it also allows me to search for the Liege.\r\n\r\n4 Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Kitchen Finks\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 Wilt-Leaf Liege\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Primal Command\r\n\r\nThe three-drops are important, so I’d like to include eight one-drop accelerators. Birds get the nod over Boreal Druids since the snow guys can’t produce Cavaliers on turn two. I also assume 23 lands.\r\n\r\n4 Llanowar Elves\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Birds of Paradise\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Kitchen Finks\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 Wilt-Leaf Liege\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Primal Command\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n23 Lands\r\n\r\nThat’s 44 cards, leaving us with 16 slots to fight the other matchup: Faeries. For Faeries, the traditional green answer has been Cloudthresher. However, I’m a bit partial to Spectral Force, which just plows through Bitterblossom tokens like there’s no tomorrow. (And I only have 2 ‘threshers) So I can add them as follows:\r\n\r\n4 Llanowar Elves\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Birds of Paradise\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Kitchen Finks\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 Wilt-Leaf Liege\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Spectral Force\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 Cloudthresher\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Primal Command\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n23 Lands\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n11 Slots left.\r\n\r\nThe problem with Force or Thresher against Faeries is Sower of Temptation. Fortunately, they still need to tap out for Sower, so I’d like to have some cheap removal to take out the Sower. Ideally, it would be instant-speed as well to make it good against Scion of Oona and manlands. Green is hopeless in terms of removal, so I scoured the White cards in gatherer and found the following candidates:\r\n \r\n\r\n  Oblivion Ring – not cheap and not instant speed, but a lot more flexible, can take out Planeswalkers, Bitterblossom, Loxodon Warhammers, etc. \r\n  Condemn – very narrow, after the first Condemn they would simply not send their Scions or Sowers into the red zone. Excellent against Mutavaults, Treetop Villages and Faerie Conclaves. That might be enough. \r\n  Last Breath – cheap, instant-speed and can take out both Sower and Scion, and can hit Mutavaults and Faerie Conclaves as a bonus. Very narrow, but may be viable. \r\n  Sunlance – cheap and strong, but sorcery speed. The \"nonwhite\" part only matters in the mirror and against Kithkin. \r\n  Crib Swap – not cheap, but it’s an instant and strongly unconditional. Sometimes the shapeshifter matters, but it walks so we can block it. \r\n  Swords to Plowshares – cheap, strong and instant-speed; the best option, but not Standard legal. \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\nThe decision is very tough. For now I go with 4 Sunlance and 3 Oblivion Ring.\r\n\r\n4 Llanowar Elves\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Birds of Paradise\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Kitchen Finks\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 Wilt-Leaf Liege\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Spectral Force\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n2 Cloudthresher\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n4 Sunlance\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Oblivion Ring\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n3 Primal Command\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\n23 Lands\r\n\r\nSo far: 23 creatures, 10 spells.\r\n\r\nFor the last four slots, I’m looking at the following cards:\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Scryb Ranger – solid against Faeries and Merfolk, untaps the Force and also helps acceleration. Works best if there are Warhammers involved. Requires significant forest commitment. \r\n  Griffin Guide – additional evasion and anti-Wrath \r\n  Loxodon Warhammer – solid, but may not be necessary here (and not worth it as a 4-of) \r\n  Shield of the Oversoul – Is it worth it in constructed? Maybe, but probably not. Still, it implies 5/6 flying indestructible vigilant attacker on turn four. \r\n  Mercy Killing – apparently I still haven’t had enough of this probably bad card. Imagine that your opponent plays Shriekmaw on Spectral Force. In response, Mercy Killing on the Force, netting eight 1/1 green and white elves. On my turn, play Liege and swing for 24. Fun, but probably not a serious contender. \r\n  Glittering Wish – I have a playset that I’ve wanted to put into a deck for the longest time. With Shadowmoor being a hybrid set it might be worth it now. Viable wish targets: Vexing Shusher, Oversoul of Dusk, Gaddock Teeg, Firespout, Teferi’s Moat, Fiery Justice. Are there any others? \r\n  Riftsweeper – Rift Bolt, Lotus Bloom, Riftwing Cloudskate. I can’t think of anything else it could hit. \r\n  Squall Line – improves the Faerie matchup and serves as instant-speed finisher.\r\n  \r\n    Boggart Ram-Gang – post-Wrath beats \r\n  Garruk Wildspeaker – generally a good card \r\n  Tarmogoyf – I only have one! \r\n  Disintegrate – comes out of nowhere! \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\nThat’s a lot of choices, and I’m sure there’s more I’m not thinking of. For now I’ll go with +2 Squall Line, +2 Loxodon Warhammer. Glittering Wish is another possibility, but to do that I would need to flesh out my sideboard first.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nAfter that I fill in the lands. I go with ten duals, four manlands and basics for the rest. I can’t afford any colorless sources if I want to consistently get Wilt-Leaf Cavs on turn 2, so no Desert or Mutavault for now. Actually even Treetop Village is a bit iffy here since it’s a turn slower than just a basic forest, but we’ll see how it goes.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nThe final decklist:\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"decklist\"\r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n    li class=\"header\"\r\n      Creatures\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Llanowar Elves\"Llanowar Elves/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Birds of Paradise\"Birds of Paradise/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers\"Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Kitchen Finks\"Kitchen Finks/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wilt-Leaf Liege\"Wilt-Leaf Liege/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      3 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spectral Force\"Spectral Force/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Cloudthresher\"Cloudthresher/a\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n    li class=\"header\"\r\n      Spells\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sunlance\"Sunlance/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      3 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Oblivion Ring\"Oblivion Ring/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      3 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Primal Command\"Primal Command/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Loxodon Warhammer\"Loxodon Warhammer/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Squall Line\"Squall Line/a\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n    li class=\"header\"\r\n      Lands\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Treetop Village\"Treetop Village/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wooded Bastion\"Wooded Bastion/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Brushlands\"Brushlands/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Horizon Canopy\"Horizon Canopy/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Plains\"Plains/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      7 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Forest\"Forest/a\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  div style=\"clear:both\"\r\n  /div\r\n/div\r\n\r\nI’ll probably tweak the above list before Saturday, but it should be a pretty good idea of where I’m going with this.

Probably need some sort of sanity check as well, to make sure I haven't designed a pile of actual garbage!",

The original Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles came out on the NGC.\r\n   \r\n**\r\n    \r\nRing of Fates\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nis a different game for the NDS, though I guess it's sort of a spiritual successor. I finally managed to get some NDS time and finish this game last night.\r\n   \r\n!--more--\r\n\r\nFFC: RoF follows the story of the twins Yuri and Chelinka who live a simple life with their father in an isolated cabin. Things are not as they seem however and of course eventually the twins' world is turned upside-down and they find themselves having to find dangerous beasts and cast powerful magicks. It's the usual RPG fare, albeit a bit too kiddified at some points. And as you would expect from a Square Enix title, we get an ending that's literally out of this world.\r\n\r\nIt's got the usual action RPG trappings: swinging your sword, jumping around, puzzles that involve really big switches, etc. Gameplay-wise it's pretty decent, with each of the four main characters providing different styles of play (although Yuri is definitely the strongest one... or that just might be because I always gave him the best stuff). The difficulty level is not that high, though some people may find the platforming bits off-putting. Boss battles are the usual fare -- figure out the enemy's attack patterns and how to beat them, etc. The game does a good job of curving you up to make sure you know how to use the various gameplay mechanics.\r\n\r\nMy first complaint is about a particular \"gate\" in the final dungeon. Games like RPGs are sometimes referred to as \"gate-driven\", because the player is presented with a sequence of \"gates\" or challenges he has to pass in order to complete the game. The \"gate\" I'm talking about in the final dungeon is a switch. The switch is visible in plain sight, but when I got there I had no idea how to turn it on. The usual action of just stepping on it didn't work, I tried throwing various stuff or casting spells on it, but no such luck. I actually set aside the game for a few days because I couldn't figure out that switch.\r\n\r\nI actually needed It turns out I need to perform a particulat air-based attack to hit the switch from a jump. Normally this would be fine, except that the game has never required me to use that particular move anywhere else! It was taught in a short tutorial near the start of the game, but I've never used it after that so I even forgot it existed. It's a bit disappointing because elsewhere the game does a great job of \"teaching\" you how to use the various actions as required.\r\n\r\nThe second gripe is a bit related: there are some platforms that require a particular camera angle in order for you to see how to proceed, and it's not always clear how to get there. You end up walking to different positions to try and figure out how to get past the \"gate\". In general in RPG design I think that whenever the player is forced to figure something out by trial and error it's kind of lame and bad design.\r\n\r\nThese problems are mostly confined to the last dungeon of the game though, most of the time I just breezed through. The story mode will take about ten hours to complete, assuming decent platforming skills. THis may seem a bit short to the average RPG player who grew up with Final Fantasy VII, but it's actually a nice bite-sized helping for guys like me who don't have much time to dedicate to gaming and want to get on to the next game as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nI give FFCC:RoF 3.5 out of 5 stars, decent enough. What? I don't give ratings here? Right.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by switch on 2008-04-28 16:30:26 +0000\r\nFrom what I'd seen, I'd say it may also be a spiritual successor to Brave\r\n  \r\nFencer Musashi on the PS. Now that game needs a sequel.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2008-04-28 21:05:18 +0000\r\nActually, it did have a sequel. There was a Musashi game on the PS2.",

It refers to a condition of excessive sweating and/or trembling in the hands and/or feet. The concept is so well-known among Filipinos that it has developed several old wives' tales of its' own, such as the ever-popular solution of peeing on your hands first thing in the morning to get rid of the conditions.\r\n\r\nI am pasmado. Sometimes at least, especially when under stress or it's really, really humid. The reason I got to thinking about it was that I finally realized it was affecting the way I play in Magic tournaments. After a few rounds of playing Magic, it always happens that the card sleeves start sticking to each other due to my sweaty hands. It's quite a distraction and one my opponents even commented on my sweaty hands after the post-match handshake.\r\n\r\nI thought about looking for a solution (one that didn't involve pee), and did a bit of research on the concept of _pasmado _online. The difficult part was figuring out what the condition was called in English. I asked a few people and none could give any decisive answer.\r\n\r\nMy brother claimed the concept did not exist in Western medicine so there was no English term for it. Some thought that the condition was fictional and only exists in old wives' tales. Quoting a Pugad Baboy comic: \"Kung totoo yung pasmado, ano sa English yun?\" \"Edi pasmatic\".\r\n\r\nEventually I dug up a thread about pasmado on yehey.com that told me what the English medical term was: Palmar Hyperhidrosis. Sure enough, Wikipedia confirmed that such a condition did exist . I even came across a website called CureSweatyPalms.com! \r\n\r\nThe Wikipedia entry cites several drugs that reduce hyperhidrosis and there's even a surgery option for extreme cases. However, I didn't want to spend on medicine or god forbid surgery just so I could play better Magic. I've lived with this condition for as long as I can recall so I can tolerate it most of the time. I've decided to instead to take up the simplest solution I could think of: I'm going to buy gloves.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.peyups.com/posts.khtml?mode=viewtopic&topic=16442&forum=37&start=90\r\n [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidrosis\r\n [3]: http://www.curesweatypalms.com/Hyperhidrosis_Palmar.shtml\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by peng on 2008-04-14 00:07:30 +0000\r\nor you could start peeing on your hands. it works. must be the nitrates or\r\n  \r\nsomething.\r\n\r\nincidentally i am less pasmado since moving here. it may be the humidity.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2008-04-14 22:10:38 +0000\r\nYuck!

Enjoyment. Tournament report follows.\r\n   \r\n!--more--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 1: UB Faeries\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nIt's basically impossible to join a standard tournament without seeing UB Faeries. This matchup is a race, since usually there's no blocking involved. But I felt confident since they have Bitterblossom and I have Psionic Blast, so I had a lower damage target. However, the main enemy in this matchup is Cryptic Command, since it stalls one round of damage which is huge in such a close race. I won game one easily since I got a nuts draw and my opponent seemed not used to playing against the fish.\r\n\r\nI &#8216;m not sure exactly how I sideboarded here but it was almost certainly wrong, as I remember changing my board decisions 2 or 3 times. I proceeded to lose games two and three, although game three was very close. My opponent had boarded in more removal (4 Shriekmaws) which meant I almost never had a lord on the board -- good choice.\r\n\r\nGames 1-2 Matches 0-1\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: bold\"br / Round 2: UBw Control (with Reveillark)br / br / /span\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how the opponent could possibly win here; the matchup is very similar to Faeries, except that my guys are unblockable. The normal plan is to have 3-6 guys in play by turn 3, then just use permission to stop Wraths/Damnations/whatever. Delay is excellent in this matchup since you send the Damnation back three turns where he's hopefully dead. I think I boarded in +2 Sower -2 random dorks, and won in three games.\r\n\r\nGames 3-3 Matches 1-1\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: bold\"br / Round 3: UB Faeriesbr / /span\r\n\r\nYes, once again Faeries! Game one I had my opponent at one life and she had Bitterblossom out so I thought I would win, but end of turn Scion + Spellstutter + me forgetting to count the Faerie Conclave meant she was able to take me from 17 to 0 in one turn... \r\n\r\nHowever, I managed to pull ahead and comfortably win games two and three.\r\n\r\nGames 5-4 Matches 2-1\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: bold\"br / Round 4: UB Faeriesbr / /span\r\n\r\n3 out of 4 opponents now brought this deck. Game one here was very close, as he killed me the turn before Bitterblossom would have killed him. A Cryptic Command decided that race, and he knew enough to play it inside the attack step so that I had no window to play a Merfolk spell to untap a creature.\r\n\r\nGame two I mulligan to five, get stuck on one land and promptly lose. My opponent was apologetic about the mana screw, but hey that's the way the game works.\r\n\r\nGames 5-6 Matches 2-2\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: bold\"br / Round 5: UB Faeriesbr / /span\r\n\r\nI didn't even bother writing the matchup in the notes anymore, I would surely remember that 4 out of the first five rounds I faced Faeries.\r\n\r\nGame one my opponent tried to stay alive by using a Sower on my Lord of Atlantis -- but that doesn't actually do anything since my guys get the bonus no matter where the Lord is. I lose game two to fast beats, then in game three I get the nuts draw: Turn 1 -- Suspend Visions, Turn 2 -- Banneret, Turn 3 -- Reejerey, Adept (revealing Adept), untap island, one more Adept (revealing 3rd Adept). I actually had the 4th Adept as well, but I didn't want to overcommit to the board. No hope for the opponent's survival here... \r\n\r\nGames 7-7 Matches 3-2\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 6: BRwu Control\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nA strange controllish deck, I got hit by Avalanche Riders, Reveillarks and Hellkites, etc. I was close to sealing off game one with him at 5 and me holding the PsiBlast, but he manages to get a Tendrils off and I lost after that.\r\n\r\nI board in +2 Sower -2 Sage's Dousing. I win the next two games easily without drawing the Sowers though... I just make it a point to be more careful about Tendrils.\r\n\r\nGames 9-8 Matches 4-2\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 7: Monored Burn\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nFinally, an opponent without islands! It's immediately obvious what he's playing when his turn 1 is mountain, suspend rift bolt. I take some hits, and he chooses to point his burn at me instead of my critters, which I think is a mistake. Against a straight control deck that's fine, but this one is an aggro-control swarm; I only need to make sure his burn doesn't deal the twentieth point of damage and surely my creatures can finish the job. At least, that was the plan, until he played Crusher and suspended Big Gargs. I kept chumping the Crusher while waiting for my answer -- Sower. When I finally drew it, it forced him to sac the Crusher and he was already in topdeck mode so I just went in, dealing 4-5 points of damage at a time to win the game at one life. The Sage's Dousing and Silvergill Adepts were awesome in this matchup, ensuring that he loses steam before me.\r\n\r\nI board in Flash Freeze for Delays. Second game is much like the first, except he draws no creatures except for a lone Mogg Fanatic which he sacs to off a Banneret, and he's also mana flooded. He's learned from the first game and keeps killing the lords, but eventually even the 1/1s manage to kill him. I ended the game at a comfortable 4 life, holding 2 flash freeze and a sage's dousing.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nFinal record:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nGames 11-8, Matches 5-2, #15\r\n\r\nI win a Morningtide Booster, and the rare is\r\n   \r\n**\r\n    \r\nIdyllic Tutor!\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nTo be honest, I'm glad to win anything at all, as I haven't won anything since the Morningtide Release event.\r\n\r\nWell, that wasn't bad for a deck put together quicky with no playtesting at all. I wasn't able to use the Surgespanners, which I had hoped to use against &#8216;Lark but after getting a feel of the deck the Surgespanners seem a bit too slow. Still, the deck is a pretty good choice for the meta. It has about an even chance with Faeries, I think it has a positive matchup against slow control decks and with a little luck can even survive against monored burn, even without Dragon Claws or Bottle Gnomes. I've always preferred turning men sideways in order to win, so I find this deck appeals to me more than &#8216;Lark.\r\n\r\nWhat will I play next week? Stay tuned!",

I played Standard again with minor changes to last week's deck.\r\n\r\nSideboard changes: -3 Surgespanner, +3 Unsummon\r\n\r\nTournament report follows.\r\n   \r\n!--more--\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 1: Merfolk vs Monored Burn\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nLast week I managed to 2-0 against a burn deck but this time went against me. In game one I died due to taking 10 damage total from two Mudbutton Torchrunners that I should have just blocked early. Game two I managed to fight back, getting a nuts aggro draw that meant I only took 3 damage for the whole game. Unfortunately in game three I didn't even manage to get one damage in, due to rapid Fanatic/Marauder attacks.\r\n\r\nI'm not entirely sure how to play against the burn deck now. I seem to be at an advantage if I get into early aggro and force him to play as control. But not all hands can support that plan.\r\n\r\nSomeday I will gather statistics on how often I lose round one.\r\n\r\nGames 1-2 Matches 0-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 2: Merfolk vs UB Bitterblossom Control\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nWeird build, with Shadowmage Infiltrators which are generally frowned upon in the Bitterblossom heavy metagame. I lost game one somehow, I think to a mainboarded Sower. The only creatures I saw were Shadowmages, Venser and Sower. I assume some sort of Mannequin build and bring in Sowers and Unsummons in case there were some sort of fatties. He gets a slow draw in game two and I win off numerous turns of attacking for one.\r\n\r\nIn game three, he gets out an early Bitterblossom and a Loxodon Warhammer, pretty much bad news for me. I go full aggro to attempt to race the warhammer, but since he only has five mana I gain a lot of tempo by using Unsummons, Psionic Blasts and Sowers on whatever he equips the Warhammer to. It was lucky that he decided to be defensive, if he had tried to race me with the Warhammer I might not have won.\r\n\r\nGames 3-3 Matches 1-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 3: Merfolk vs UG Faeries\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n_\r\n    \r\n\"Basta may island, good matchup!\"\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n\r\nI actually didn't know he was on Faeries in game one since all he showed me were two Goyfs. An army of Merfolk happily raced the two 3/4 Goyfs. We had ten power, they had six. And he had an island!\r\n\r\nI think I boarded in +2 Sower of Temptation -2 Sage's Dousing. In general, if there's no mass removal to be expected it's safe to reduce permission.\r\n\r\nIn game two I start to see the Pestermites, Spellstutters and Mistbind Clique, and I don't really gain much ground in the first three turns. On my fifth upkeep he attempts to Mystic Snake my Ancestral Visions. I Delay the Snake, draw into and play a fistful of merfolk and take him down to a meager three life in the next two turns. I show him Psionic Blast and he jokingly asks what the target is.\r\n\r\nGames 5-3 Matches 2-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 4: Merfolk vs Monogreen aggro\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nGame one he manages to flash in a Scryb Ranger. Then he gives it a Warhammer! He has large guys stalling the ground so I can't win the race.\r\n\r\nI go into a full control sideboard: +4 Rune Snage +4 Flash Freeze + 3 Unsummon +2 Sower of Temptation -4 Sage's Dousing -2 Lord of Atlantis -4 Tideshaper Mystic -1 Ancestral Vision -2 Stonybrook Banneret. I don't want that Scryb Ranger to resolve!\r\n\r\nGame two he stalls for a long time before deciding to keep. His first turn was a forest without an elf, so I knew things were looking good. We make no plays on the first and second turn; third turn he plays Call of the Herd that I Rune Snag. Next turn he flashes it back and gets a 3/3 Elephant. I play Sower taking the Elephant, gambling with the tap out and hoping he doesn't have the Scryb Ranger. He doesn't, and I just back up those five points of power with permission to win the game.\r\n\r\nGame three he holds on to a hand without an elf again, and I don't even take any damage this time.\r\n\r\nGames 7-4 Matches 3-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 5: Merfolk vs Monored Burn\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nI sigh inwardly when I see who I'm paired with, since I already know he has a burn deck. Game one goes quickly, due to me having no answer to Mutavaults pumped by Lords of Atlantis. I board in Sowers and Flash Freezes. He boarded out Gargadons and Crushers, go figure. I lose game two to unrelenting attacks from Mogg Fanatic and Mutavaults.\r\n\r\nGames 7-6 Matches 3-2\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 6: Merfolk vs G/B Rock\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nApparently my opponent kept a greedy hand -- six lands and a BoP. I had him at ten life before he could even untap with four mana. He surveys the ten power worth of Merfolk on the board and scoops. We finish game one in under two minutes -- the adjacent table hasn't even finished shuffling yet!\r\n\r\nGame two I board in Sowers and Unsummons. He gets a Troll down and a Warhammer equipped. I grab his other creatures using Sowers to chump-block and race him with 8-10 power of Merfolk and Conclaves. I dealt a total of 32 damage during this game, just enough to win.\r\n\r\nGames 9-6 Matches 4-2\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 7: Merfolk vs Monogreen Elves\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nGame one he gets out early Paragons, but I stabilize with a Sower on an Imperious Perfect with two +1/+1 counters. My merfolk eventually get big enough to bash through and I take game one, winning with 5 life remaining.\r\n\r\nI board in Sowers + Unsummons + Flashfreeze again, basically the best Sideboard plan ever against green decks.\r\n\r\nGame two and hold off on attacking early, instead building up advantage through permission and Adepts. Eventually I manage to have one Reejerey and two Lords join my last Adept, total of seventeen power worth of Merfolk on the board. He lays down more Elves to block, but I have three lords to his none, he has no chance and his sideboarded Hail Storm was surprising yet no help.\r\n\r\nFinal record: Games 11-6 Matches 5-2, #11\r\n\r\nSlightly better record this time, the Unsummons really helped against the green decks. Still a bit disappointing as it means I won't have a Prerelease pass for free this time around. I win two packs -- rares are Mind Shatter and Notorious Throng.\r\n\r\nNext: Shadowmoor Prerelease!",

The curve is far too high and not too many early creatures. I found myself boarding in at least +1\r\n   \r\nPlains\r\n   \r\n, +1\r\n   \r\nBallynock Cohort\r\n   \r\n, +1\r\n   \r\nSafehold Sentry\r\n   \r\nevery time.\r\n\r\nNo detailed match reports this time. I faced B/R decks in all four rounds, losing only to the third round opponent who had like six one drops in his deck. Against my deck of very high mana costs, he played very well.\r\n\r\nMy deck relies only on\r\n   \r\nMossbridge Troll\r\n   \r\nand\r\n   \r\nWindbrisk Raptor\r\n   \r\nto win the game. In fact I don't recall winning without either one of those cards. Without a common \"Bury\" removal effect in red and or black, neither of those creatures ever died. In the very last game, I finally managed to connect with a 25/25 Troll while I had the Raptor in play. The game was almost over for me before that turn as I was at 5 life facing that RB witch. With one troll attack suddenly I was up to 30! My opponent had to stare at the attacking 25/25 troll for a few seconds... \r\n\r\nSome thoughts on Shadowmoor sealed:\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  Drove of Elves\r\n    \r\n    Shield of the Oversoul\r\n    \r\n    = very hard to kill guy that gradually gets bigger \r\n  The best removal seems to be white-aligned:\r\n    \r\n    Curse of Chains\r\n    \r\n    and\r\n    \r\n    Mercy Killing\r\n    \r\n    were pretty much my only control cards. And even though I didn't have it,\r\n    \r\n    Prison Term\r\n    \r\n    seems pretty strong as well. \r\n  I'm not sure about the BR deck in this format, as their creatures are really puny. If you have the\r\n    \r\n    Ashenmoor Liege\r\n    \r\n    and 2-3\r\n    \r\n    Ashenmoor Gouger\r\n    \r\n    maybe, but those are rares and uncommons. Red only has one good common removal this time around (although it's very good --\r\n    \r\n    Magma Burst\r\n    \r\n    good.) \r\n  That silly Scarecrow that can't get counters? He blocks Wither guys all day long. \r\n  Seeing as how all my matches were GW vs RB, I have no idea how blue works in this set. \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\nNext week: Sneak Peek!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Plains\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Ballynock Cohort\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Safehold Sentry\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Mossbridge Troll\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Windbrisk Raptor\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Drove of Elves\r\n [7]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Shield of the Oversoul\r\n [8]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Curse of Chains\r\n [9]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Mercy Killing\r\n [10]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Prison Term\r\n [11]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Ashenmoor Liege\r\n [12]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Ashenmoor Gouger\r",

Why have I never opened that common?\r\n\r\nRound 2 vs Red Black: 2-0 win\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI actually got to play against the pool I opened! I almost lost to Rage Reflection in game one, but luckily my maindeck Gleeful Sabotage came through via topdeck. Merrow Rootcutters gave me a lot of trouble, so I sided in 2 Inquisitor's Snare for Mercy Killing and Aethertow.\r\n\r\nIn game 2 he had a perfect curve for turns 1-3 but then stalled on four lands. I later found out he was holding something like three five-drops in his hand, including the Demigod of Revenge. I manage to drop my Swans before his fifth land and bring the race close enough for me to kill in 1-2 swings. By then he manages to draw a second mountain and play Kulrath Knight. I'm stupid here and think the Wither would affect the Swans (it won't), so when his Knight blocks I hit it with Inquisitor's Snare.\r\n\r\nNext turn he plays Demigod but doesn't attack, seeing as how I could swing back for maybe lethal. We stare off for a few turns; I can't afford to swing as he'll just block the Swans and draw a bunch of cards. Finally he draws the sixth land and lays down Rage Reflection, pumps Demigod with Revelsong Horn then swings with the big mean 6/5 flying double-striker. He's tapped out, at five life, with no other fliers. I have the Swans and Barkshell Blessing in hand. I block the Demigod and tell him the Swans don't die. He reads the card, shakes his head and draws his twelve cards. I untap, swing with the Swans and show him the pump for the win.\r\n\r\nRound 3 vs WG 2-0 win\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI'm paired down for some reason. My opponent starts with early Scuttlemutts, and I hit Wilt-Leaf Cavs on turn three and Shield of the Oversoul on turn four. I'm gambling that my opponent won't realize the Scuttlemutt trick, as he seems genuinely distressed at the 5/6/ vigilant indestructible flier, so I keep swinging till I win. Game two I open with the same turns 3 and 4 and win easily. After the game I tell him about the Scuttlemutt trick.\r\n\r\nMy sweaty hands seem to be getting worse by the way.\r\n\r\nRound 4 vs RG 2-1 win\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI lose game one to a powerful curve -- turn one Nurturer Initiate, turn two Devoted Druid, turn three Ram-Gang, turn four Morselhoarder (!), and quickly lose without being able to put up a decent defense.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nI board +2 Inquisitor's Snare -1 Mercy Killing -1 Gleeful Sabotage.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nGame two I choose to play first, even though I've always chosen to draw in the previous rounds. I can't afford that kind of opening again. Luckily I get an early fatty out and his offense never starts off. I win with a flying indestructible Cavalier.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nGame three he's on the play and has no one-drop again (lucky!). I lay down Oversoul of Dusk on turn five and he's terribly annoyed. It's a standoff between the Oversoul and 3-4 creatures on his side of the board. I play the Liege and swing with the 7/7 oversoul bringing him to 13. He uses Tower Above to take out the Liege. I swing with the 5/5 and use Spectral Procession to create blockers. We're both at 8.\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nOn his turn he lays down a bunch of creatures including Safehold Elite (which can block the Oversoul!) and is ready to swing and kill me next turn. I topdeck the Shield of the Oversoul and show it to him. \"That's only 7/7,\" he shrugs. I show him the last card in my hand -- Tower Above, and I take the win.\r\n\r\nFour and O! If only I had this pool last week... \r\n\r\nSome thoughts on particular cards:\r\n\r\n**\r\n  \r\nMercy Killing\r\n  \r\n** \r\n   \r\n-- this is a pretty bad to mediocre removal card, yet I keep putting it in. I kept dreaming of having the Liege and the Oversoul in play, then EOT mercy kill the Oversoul, gaining 7 3/3 elves. This particular fantasy play has yet to happen. Still, the card has it's roles, particularly getting rid of utility Q creatures, a role which Curse of Chains or Aethertow (both excellent removal cards) cannot fulfill.\r\n\r\n**\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n** \r\n  \r\n**\r\n    \r\nManamorphose\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n**\r\n  \r\n** \r\n  \r\n**\r\n    \r\n/\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n**\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n** \r\n  \r\n**\r\n    \r\nElsewhere Flask\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n**\r\n  \r\n** \r\n   \r\n-- I get some flak for not putting in these \"free\" cards. I have enough trouble cutting things in the maindeck, thanks. In particular matchups I may board them in, say there's a particular threat or answer I want to draw as often or as soon as possible. Manamorphose is the better card, as it's truly free, the only requirement being having two mana free (but you get that mana back)\r\n\r\n**\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n** \r\n  \r\n**\r\n    \r\nGleeful Sabotage\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n**\r\n  \r\n** \r\n   \r\n-- the format is rife with common artifact creatures and powerful auras, so play this one maindeck.\r\n   \r\nSmash to Smithereens\r\n   \r\nand the 1/1 elf that can kill enchantments are similarly solid.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nScarecrows --\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nuse these to fill out your curve, they're especially useful to stop the \"evasive hill giant\" cycle.\r\n   \r\nLurebound Scarecrow\r\n   \r\nis a bit dangerous as it can be a 2-for-1 against you.\r\n   \r\nWicker Warcrawler\r\n   \r\nis fairly strong; note that it gains the -1/-1 counter at end of combat, so the first swing is for six. Getting out a turn four or five Warcrawler usually means card advantage as your opponents will be forced to chump block.\r\n\r\n**\r\n  \r\nTrip Noose\r\n  \r\n** \r\n  \r\n**\r\n  \r\n** \r\n   \r\n-- Icy Manipulator, except more mana-intensive. Still very good, especially in midrange decks where you can take out the crucial blocker that stops your fatties.\r\n\r\nThat's all for today.

So while I've often read a lot of those articles about how to maintain focus, I've never actually realized how difficult it was until I brought home a bunch of work-related reading material to catch up on. Yes, I tried to read boring work-related stuff on an internet-enabled machine. Wonder how much progress I managed?\r\n  \r\n!--more--\r\n\r\nI woke up around 8:00 AM. The plan was to review a set of documents and plan ahead the work for the coming week. It shouldn't have taken me more than two hours. By 5 PM, I had accomplished the following:\r\n\r\n  seen the latest episodes of Big Bang Theory, Scrubs, Smallville and Boston Legal\r\n  chatted with various people online about Magic: The Gathering and Forbidden Kingdom (no spoilers, haven't watched it yet!) and random other junk\r\n  played around an hour of Final Fantasy: Crystal Chronicles\r\n  made various posts on online forums\r\n  cleaned up my desktop\r\n  taken 2 baths (it was hot!)\r\n\r\nAnd yes, I finally managed to finish what I had to do. I had a rough outline of work to do over the next few days. It was a bit less than I had expected to actually accomplish over the whole day, but it was the bare minimum I wanted to finish.\r\n\r\nThis is a sad testament to what I would expect if I ever became a freelancer who worked from home. I need to be able to summon necessary focus on things that need to be done before I could even consider such a working path. Otherwise I would end up goofing off some 70% of the day.",

Luckily I'm modifying the default template instead of starting from scratch. The one I'm creating is rather simple but after spending almost 8 hours on it so far, I'm still far away from completing it. I'm guessing the more complicated layouts take more than two weeks of full-time work.\r\n\r\nHere's my current WIP:\r\n\r\n[\r\n  \r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-thumbnail wp-image-489\" title=\"screenshot\" src=\"/files/uploads/2008/05/screenshot-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" /][2] \r\n\r\nChanges since the last part:\r\n\r\n!--more--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  I moved the blog title and blog name into the header image. For this I had to darken the image a bit using the Gimp so that the white text isn't difficult to read against the header image. \r\n  Changed the layout to use CSS and divs instead of the previous table-based layout. I solved the \"columns with equal heights\" problem using a hack I found from several websites./p \r\n      Basically: for each column you add a large amount of padding to the bottom of each column, then apply a negative margin so that the padding isn't actually visible on-screen. This will create a scrollbar in the containing div though, so you need to hide the overflow. Sample CSS for this is:/p div class='hl_wrap'\r\n          table class=\"sourcetable\"\r\n            tr\r\n              td class=\"linenos\"\r\n                pre1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7\r\n8/pre\r\n              /td\r\n              \r\n              td class=\"code\"\r\n                div class=\"source\"\r\n                  pre     .content {\r\noverflow: hidden; /* Part of equal heights column hack */\r\n}\r\n.column {\r\nmargin-bottom: -20000px; /* Part of equal heights column hack */\r\npadding-bottom: 20000px; /* Part of equal heights column hack */\r\n}\r\n    \r\n/pre\r\n                /div\r\n              /td\r\n            /tr\r\n          /table\r\n        /div\r\n\r\n  Centering the main div was something I didn't know how to do either. The solution was to set left and right margin to auto in the divs. But this is ignored by IE6 so in addition to that, you need to set text-align: center in the body. \r\n  Set the background color of the page to be the same as rightmost column. \r\n  Modified index.php by removing the while loop to iterate over the posts. This is so that only the latest post appears in the leftmost column. \r\n  Added the \"recent posts\" listing in the center column. Relevant code inserted into sidebar.php:/p div class='hl_wrap'\r\n      table class=\"sourcetable\"\r\n        tr\r\n          td class=\"linenos\"\r\n            pre 1\r\n 2\r\n 3\r\n 4\r\n 5\r\n 6\r\n 7\r\n 8\r\n 9\r\n10\r\n11\r\n12\r\n13\r\n14\r\n15\r\n16\r\n17\r\n18/pre\r\n          /td\r\n          \r\n          td class=\"code\"\r\n            div class=\"source\"\r\n              pre   &lt;table class=\"recent-posts\" &gt;\r\n&lt;?php\r\nglobal $post;\r\n$recentposts = get_posts('numberposts=5&amp;offset=2');\r\nforeach($recentposts as $post) {\r\n?&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td rowspan=\"2\" class=\"date-cell\"&gt;&lt;?php the_time('d M Y', '', '') ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;td&gt;&lt;a class=\"recent-title\" href=\"&lt;?php thepermalink() ?&gt;\"&gt; &lt;?php thetitle() ?&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;tr&gt;\r\n&lt;td class=\"recent-cats\"&gt;Filed under &lt;?php the_category(', '); ?&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;\r\n&lt;?php\r\n}\r\n?&gt;\r\n&lt;/table&gt;\r\n  \r\n/pre\r\n            /div\r\n          /td\r\n        /tr\r\n      /table\r\n    /div\r\n\r\n  I don't want the about info hardcoded into the right column, so I modify it instead to display the contents of any page titled \"about\". The code shown below is cribbed from Hemingway Reloaded WordPress theme:/p div class='hl_wrap'\r\n      table class=\"sourcetable\"\r\n        tr\r\n          td class=\"linenos\"\r\n            pre1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4\r\n5\r\n6\r\n7/pre\r\n          /td\r\n          \r\n          td class=\"code\"\r\n            div class=\"source\"\r\n              pre   &lt;?php query_posts('pagename=about'); ?&gt;\r\n&lt;?php if (have_posts()) : ?&gt;\r\n&lt;?php while (haveposts()) : thepost(); ?&gt;\r\n&lt;?php the_content(); ?&gt;\r\n&lt;?php endwhile; ?&gt;\r\n&lt;?php endif; ?&gt;\r\n  \r\n/pre\r\n            /div\r\n          /td\r\n        /tr\r\n      /table\r\n    /div\r\n\r\n  Changed the standard font used to Arial 12px \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\nThe above changes took me around half the day today (well, there were naps and videogames in between, et cetera) and the theme is starting to look decent, but there's still a lot to do: navigation links, search pages, category lists, archive page, single post page, page template are the ones I can name off the top of my head right now.\r\n\r\nStill, WordPress has turned out remarkably easy to customize, the PHP functions exposed as template tags are usually enough for whatever you plan to do, and the documentation on\r\n   \r\n[\r\n    \r\ncodex.wordpress.com][3] \r\n   \r\nis pretty thorough as well.\r\n\r\nThe hard part turned out to be figuring out CSS-related problems. Luckily, CSS and browser-specific issues are well-discussed problems online so I could easily find the solution to the problems via the internet.\r\n\r\nI'll continue working on this whenever I have time, and hopefully can have the theme live on the Roy on Magic blog soon.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/blog/2008/04/creating-a-wordpress-template-part-1/\r\n [2]: /files/uploads/2008/05/screenshot.png\r",

Part 2. Moonglove Winnower template is currently live on Roy on Magic.\r\n\r\nI made several color and formatting changes since the last update. Relatively easy due to the stylesheet. I also had to scrap the CSS hack for implementing equal height columns, it was causing problems with anchors in the URL. I went with a 1-pixel high background image instead.\r\n\r\nCurrently most of the PHP logic/heavy lifting is done in sidebar.php while most of the formatting stuff is handled in the stylesheet. Since I'm copying from an existing template and not creating one from scratch, I didn't actually need to learn much PHP. Most of it was moving code around.\r\n\r\nI'm not releasing this source yet because:\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  The code is still very messy \r\n  It still doesn't work properly with WordPress Widgets \r\n  I still have some improvements I want to make. The search box is missing for instance. \r\n  I'd like to release some variations (featuring other Magic card art) at the same time. \r\n  It's not yet XHTML-valid. The autocard plugin in particular is causing problems. \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\nStill, the current one is functional enough that I don't mind using it on the site.\r\n\r\nMost of the difficulty so far has been the design part: thinking about colors, how things should be arranged, etc. As an engineer, it's not one of the things I'm used to doing. I can't imagine I would be able to do some of the fancy, complicated layouts anytime soon, though I might be able to create simpler, minimalistic ones first.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/blog/2008/04/creating-a-wordpress-template-part-1/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/blog/2008/05/creating-a-wordpress-template-part-2/\r",

I'm walking into a tournament again with no playtesting, so it's almost sure to bite me in the ass. Still, it's a solid choice; hopefully I could just make some skill matter. I probably should have splashed white for some removal, but I didn't have time to gather Crib Swaps.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 1: 1-2 Loss vs Monowhite/Kithkin:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nNot a good start. All three games were close races decided by his Thistledown Liege; if I actually did have white and Crib Swaps, they would have been awesome here. I also made the mistake of not boarding in Cloudthresher to handle the Spirit tokens off Spectral Procession, since the Liege makes them a powerful clock. Ironic, since I was winning using the same combo in the draft yesterday.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 2: 2-0 win vs Red Black:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nNo surprise here, the matchup is probably something like 90-10 in my favor. In the second game, he played Countryside Crusher off one mountain and two Reflecting Pools. I played, in succession: Oversoul of Dusk (stops the Crusher), Primal Command (bounce mountain to top and search for second Oversoul), Oversoul of Dusk. At that point, his deck had no point of recovery.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 3: 1-2 loss vs Green/white/black:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nHis deck is the same as mine, except with more removal. Skill came into play here, but sadly it was my lack of skill Game one was close, but I lost game two to a 4/4 indestructible Vanquisher that suddenly became 7/1 courtesy of Nameless Inversion. I could have blocked the Vanquisher for at least two more turns; I knew he had the Inversion in hand (he revealed it for the Vanquisher) when he attacked with me at six life, still I said \"take.\" =( Checking the top cards of my library afterwards, I might have won in two more turns, since he was at one life with no fliers and I was going to draw the Shield.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nFinal Record: 1-2-Drop\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nSigh. Despite doing well in drafts, I'm on a bad streak constructed-wise. At least the deck is definitely better in block compared to standard; no real bad matchups as far as I can tell. The games I lost were winnable games this time, instead of lopsided matchups. The difference lies in playing skill. Since I still don't have time to playtest, there's not much to do but to be more careful in making my decisions.\r\n\r\nNext week: Probably nothing, as I can't play in GPT II due to another appointment.",

Being an Ubuntu user, Open Office is really the only sane choice I have for an office suite. At work I'm using Microsoft Office 2007. Among the office suite applications, I'm most of a power user for the spreadsheet applications. Here's my side-by-side comparison of Excel and oOo Calc:\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Excel 2007 on Windows XP:\r\n\r\n  Looks really pretty.\r\n  Loads up quickly.\r\n  Proprietary and expensive.\r\n  Not available for Linux.\r\n\r\nOpenOffice Calc 2.4.1 on Ubuntu:\r\n\r\n  Feature-rich -- has some features that excel does not.\r\n  I can have a sandwich in the time it's loading.\r\n  Free as in speech, and as in beer too!\r\n  Usability issues, such as inconveniently prompting a dialog box on every delete. (This is logged in their database as bug # 9392. There's a workaround, but hopefully it will be fixed by default in Open Office 3)\r\n  Autofilter feature is immature compared to Excel, not enough options for filtering.\r\n  It can open a password-protected XLS correctly (prompting me for the password), but it can't save it back with the password.\r\n  I was going to complain about the UI, but now that I've thought better of it, it's no worse than other GTK/Linux apps.\r\n\r\n!--more--\r\n\r\nI asked my mother what she thought of OpenOffice. Where she works, they used to use Microsoft Office before switching to OpenOffice due to licensing issues. She mentioned a few complaints about usability and some printing problems. But at least she's able to use it in place of Excel. On a tangent, one of the nice effects of the BSA cracking down on pirated software is that there are more companies looking at FOSS alternatives, given the insane licensing fees for Microsoft software.\r\n\r\nHopefully OpenOffice 3 will bring significant improvements to the OpenOffice suite especially in terms of UI and usability. I believe that in terms of features/functionalities it is already close enough to parity that adding more would already be significantly affected by diminishing returns. While open source software have made incredible gains in other areas such as browsers and IM clients (Firefox and Pidgin are awesome), a good and stable office suite would further accelerate its' acceptance on the desktop market.\r\n\r\nEither that, or we just wait for Google docs to overtake Microsoft Office.\r\n\r",

First place being of course the seminal Pugad Baboy, which has been running what, almost twenty years now?\r\n\r\nI digress. If you've read Beerkada, it's far from perfect. It's often corny, and sometimes he has too many of his own in-jokes. In the early strips, the author Lyndon Gregorio often blatantly rips jokes from other sources. I'm not surprised it hasn't received as much mainstream attention as Pugad Baboy has.\r\n\r\nThe strip has its' moments however, and the cast will often remind you of real-world people (with their idiosyncracies exaggerated of course). Personally, I prefer those strips where the author parodies common pop-culture references, and the sheer inaneness of such parodies is where Beerkada trumps Pugad Baboy.\r\n\r\nI recently found out Beerkada had its' own website at beerkada.net. In an attempt to attract a more global audience, the author actually translates those strips that have Tagalog content into English. Aside from the current (daily) strips, he seems to be posting the older strips online as well, albeit the archives still currently have a huge gap between 1998 and 2006. Still, it's awesome that Gregorio recognizes the power of the internet to publicize his work and willingly distributes his strips online. Hopefully, Pol Medina of Pugad Baboy fame would follow suit.\r\n\r\nNot being a regular reader of the Philippine Star, and the last Beerkada book I read having been 3-4 years old already, I went through the archives to catch up. Some choice strips so far:\r\n\r\n  Trailers \r\n  Jazz \r\n  Interweb \r\n  Taxicab \r\n  Benoit \r\n  Big Bird \r\n  Twin Towers \r\n  Nerd \r\n\r\nNot surprisingly, most of the strips I linked were related to 80's cartoon characters in some way. I guess one of the reasons I enjoy Beerkada is that Lyndon Gregorio and I are obviously of the same generation.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://beerkada.net\r\n [2]: http://www.beerkada.net/2007/05/30/wedding-trailers\r\n [3]: http://www.beerkada.net/2007/07/07/jazz\r\n [4]: http://www.beerkada.net/2007/07/10/honeymoon-interweb\r\n [5]: http://www.beerkada.net/2007/07/16/taxicab\r\n [6]: http://www.beerkada.net/2007/07/27/benoit\r\n [7]: http://www.beerkada.net/2007/08/31/big-bird\r\n [8]: http://www.beerkada.net/2007/09/15/twin-towers\r",

The format was standard and I went to play at Galleria.\r\n\r\nI have a mixed track record for regionals. During Regionals 2006, I went 1-4-drop with a rogue deck of my own design. During Regionals 2007 I played Korlash/Mishra built by Flores, going 5-and-3.\r\n\r\nI was debating whether I would even go to play in the tournament, as I was totally unprepared and was quite tired. I figured a straight aggro deck would be fine, as I didn't want to play Reveillark again for the expected nine rounds. I lent out the merfolk deck, so I cobbled together a build of Elves the night before instead:\r\n\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist }}\r\n[Lands]\r\n4 Treetop Village\r\n19 Forest\r\n[/Lands]\r\n[Creatures]\r\n4 Llanowar Elves\r\n3 Elvish Hexhunter\r\n3 Riftsweeper\r\n4 Wolf-SKull Shaman\r\n4 Wren's Run Vanquisher\r\n4 Imperious Perfect\r\n4 Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers\r\n3 Jagged-Scar Archers\r\n3 Wilt-Leaf Liege\r\n[/Creatures]\r\n[Spells]\r\n3 Tower Above\r\n2 Overrun\r\n[/Spells]\r\n[Sideboard]\r\n3 Tormod's Crypt\r\n3 Primal Command\r\n3 Kitchen Finks\r\n2 Cloudthresher\r\n2 Squall Line\r\n2 Chameleon Colossus\r\n[/Sideboard]\r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\n  \r\n!--more--\r\n\r\nI figured the Riftsweepers, Jagged-Scar and Hexhunters main gave me good game against the consensus best deck of the format (Faeries), and the relatively large size of my men, plus Finks and Primal Command in the board meant I would have favorable odds against other aggro. Control decks with Wrath of God will probably be either a coin flip or an uphill battle, although the Treetops will help. I hoped I wouldn't meet any Reveillark or Wrath-based decks.\r\n\r\nRound 1: Monogreen Elves vs WGr Mana Ramp \r\n\r\nWow, the first matchup had both Wrath and Firespout via Glittering Wish. Good portents. I won game one with an Overrun with five creatures in play. Before combat, a Jagged-Scar shot down Akroma (the White) with nine points worth of Jagged arrows, then I swung for 16ish to win.\r\n\r\nI boarded -3 Riftsweeper, -1 Wolf-Skull Shaman, bringing in 2 Chameleon Colossus (to fight his big creatures) and 2 Cloudthresher (to eat Akroma)\r\n\r\nIn game two, I was taking beats from two Oversouls, but was one turn from winning off Overrun when he cast Primal Command for 7 life and Akroma, giving him enough to stay alive and finish me off.\r\n\r\nI board out -1 Hexhunter (didn't see any Oblivions Rings), -3 Jagged Scar, +3 Kitchen Finks (better against Wrath), +1 Wolf-Skull Shaman.\r\n\r\nI draw my seven for game three and see Forest, Llanowar, Wren's Run Vanquisher, Imperious Perfect, Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers WIlt-Leaf Liege. I figure what the hell, I have gas, and drawing a second forest will put me over the top. I keep.\r\n\r\nMy opponent mulligans his seven, then agonizes over the six before mulliganning again to five.\r\n\r\nI play Forest, Llanowar, go. He drops a land, go.\r\n\r\nI draw Llanowar Elf. I play Vanquisher, go. He drops a land, go.\r\n\r\nI draw some non-land thing. I swing with the Vanquisher, then tap the forest to play Llanowar Elf. _\r\n(Misplay here obviously, the other llanowar should have attacked!)_ He drops a land, go.\r\n\r\nI draw a third Llanowar. I play Imperious Perfect using the forest and two llanowars. I swing with Vanquisher for four. He drops to thirteen. Go. He plays the fourth land, and if he plays Wrath, I'm basically done. He looks over his hand and I know he doesn't have the Wrath. He plays Mwonvuli Acid Moss, taking away my only land. (I suppose he boarded them in to slow-down me getting to Overrun mana). He searches his library before finally settling on Highland Weald. He's looking at ten damage next turn, so the Wealed optimizes his chance of topdecking either Wrath, Firespout, or Glittering Wish to get Firespout.\r\n   \r\n(Did you spot the misplay in this paragraph?) \r\n\r\nI draw a forest and play it, then swing for ten. He's at three life. He windmills the top card -- and it's a Wooded Bastion. He scoops.\r\n\r\nGame record: 2-1\r\n\r\nMatch record: 1-0\r\n\r\nI felt pretty good, going up against a Wrath deck and winning (mostly due to lucking out in the third game?). It's a bit of a struggle, but chances are I wouldn't face any more such decks right?\r\n\r\nRound 2: Monogreen Elves vs WG Mana Ramp \r\n\r\nRight. His deck is more solid, I lose mostly to him reloading off Harmonizes while I run out of gas.\r\n\r\nGame record: 2-3\r\n\r\nMatch record: 1-1\r\n\r\nRound 3: Monogreen Elves vs GWU Reveillark \r\n\r\nOh wow. If regular UW Reveillark was a tough matchup, this one is even worse, since he has green both to gain life and tutor for creatures (Primal Command) AND accelerate. I'm going home early.\r\n\r\nGame record: 2-5\r\n\r\nMatch record: 1-2\r\n\r\nSummary: 1-2 Drop \r\n\r\nWell, if it's one thing I've learned during the past few weeks of mediocre performances: it's usually not worth to keep going after taking two losses. Playing today might very well have been a mistake; if I didn't have trading meetups set for the day, I probably wouldn't have gone at all. It was 4 PM and there were six more rounds to go, I wasn't going to bother.\r\n\r\nWill I make it to Nationals this year? I don't know -- the ratings cutoff is still a month away, and I'm only two 5-2 finishes away from making it (assuming I didn't lose too much today). In any case, time to focus on block constructed for GPTs... \r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/magic/2006/06/magic-regionals-2006/\r",

I tried going with either red/green or red/black first, but wasn't getting enough good cards. I eventually settled on picking up the many blue fliers that were passing by and eventually ended up in Uw. I was still undecided and still picked from red/black occasionally in pack two until the third pack where I cracked Thistledown Liege. (I also picked Ashenmoor Liege later in the pack). I ended with around 18 R/x cards in my draft pool so my U/w deck wasn't very solid and I had to put in a bunch of filler and also splashed for Burn Trail and Ember Gale.\r\n\r\nI still managed to go 3-1 despite that, with some lucky matchups.

His first four turns, his only plays were suspending three Ancestral Visions. Eventually he drew a Yavimaya Coast, and managed a Scryb Sprite. but I was too far ahead so we shuffled up for boarding.\r\n\r\nI mistakenly assumed he was UG Faeries, so I went -2 Loxodon Warhammer, +2 Squall Line\r\n\r\nGame two, he gets out a Scryb Ranger, a Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers and a Garruk. Eventually he declares, \"Here comes my combo!\", and plays out Spectral Force, untaps two lands, then plays\r\n   \r\nSavor the Moment\r\n   \r\n. He takes the extra turn, untaps two lands with Garruk, overrun and I'm dead.\r\n\r\nI board in Condemns, deciding to take out the Squall Lines again.\r\n\r\nGame three is close. Even though I'm playing a defensive game he takes a lot of damage from having two Yavimaya Coasts as his only blue sources. He manages to get Garruk out again and I'm dangerously close to dying. He has out a a Beast token and a Wilt-Leaf cavs and I'm at two life. My only creature is a Spectral Force that won't untap until the next turn. I draw my sixth land; my hand is Oversoul and Condemn. Quick math: Oversoul can block a six-point trampler and I can cast Condemn to stay alive at one, so that's what I play. As expected, he overruns and swings and then I realize\r\n   \r\n_\r\n    \r\nmy last land is a Horizon Canopy!\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n   \r\nWhat a moron. I didn't consider the alternative play -- sac'ing the Horizon Canopy to draw a card, which turned out to be Oblivion Ring. O-Ring on the Beast, then Condemn on the cavs and I'd be alive. Sigh, not paying attention is the bane of my existence.\r\n\r\nI found out while unboarding that I really should have lost that game, as I did not actually board out the Squall Lines. In short, I had boarded out 3 cards but had boarded in 5, so I had an illegal deck! That's my karma for being careless.\r\n\r\nGames: 1-2, rounds: 0-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 2: WG vs Monoblack Bitterblossom aggro-control (?)\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nOpponent's deck is hard to describe. Bitterblossom, Oona's Blackguard, Mutavaults, Thoughtseize, Damnation, etc. Only thing sure is that he's all black. In game one I Primal Command for Oversoul, but he Thoughtseizes it before it can be cast. I just hit him with Chameleon Colossus and Wilt-Leaf Cavs instead. His deck doesn't have enough gas to counter, and I win.\r\n\r\nMy boarding was -2 Loxodon Warhammer, -3 Sunlance, -1 Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers, -1 Primal Command, -1 Birds of Paradise; +3 Condemn, +2 Squall Line, +3 Wispmare\r\n\r\nGame two he has an early\r\n   \r\nInkfathom Infiltrator\r\n   \r\n, and he uses it to prowl out two Earwig Squads which removes most of my heavy threats. However, I still manage to bring out a Liege and the Earwigs have to trade with big Kitchen Finks who just come back. I still manage to overwhelm him and win.\r\n\r\nGames: 3-2, rounds: 1-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 3: WG vs GBU Mannequin\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nAnother unique deck, courtesy of the open metagame. The deck combines features of the traditional UB Mannequin with green acceleration and life gain via Kitchen Finks. I manage to trade evenly with him most of the time, but his card advantage is too difficult to overcome. I lose in game 3 without even dealing damage to him.\r\n\r\nMy boarding plan here was -2 Loxodon Warhammer, -1 Birds of Paradise, -1 Primal Command, -1 Wilt-Leaf Liege, +3 Tormod's Crypt, +2 Stonecloaker. None of my graveyard hate came out.\r\n\r\nGames: 3-3, rounds: 1-2\r\n\r\nGah, I'm performing so poorly! I decided not to drop and try to salvage it into a 5-2.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 4: WG vs UBR Reanimator\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nHe went first. Hellkites, Akromas... I pretty much knew what to expect after the second turn Merfolk Looter. Hellkite on turn four killed my mana producers and I got stuck on three lands with no O-Rings to save me.\r\n\r\nMy boarding plan here was same as the previous round -2 Loxodon Warhammer, -1 Birds of Paradise, -1 Primal Command, -1 Wilt-Leaf Liege, +3 Tormod's Crypt, +2 Stonecloaker.\r\n\r\nThis time the hate came out, and I won game two due to a Tormod's Crypt turning his reanimation spells into dead cards.\r\n\r\nIn game 3, we go into topdeck mode without him reanimating anything. Finally, he attempts Dread Return and I show him the lone card in my hand: Stonecloaker! I RFG the Akroma he wanted, but he keeps all other creatures off the board with removal. He's at three so even a single Llanowar Elves gets hits with a Damnation. I manage to play another elf; he attempts to Dread Return again. He still has four mana open so I assume has the Mannequin to respond to Stonecloaker. I take the bait, knowing I had an O-Ring in hand for the Hellkite that would come. He plays Mannequin in response as I expected. I clarify: \"Is the Stonecloaker in play?\" His response: \"No, still on the stack.\" Perfect! I let Mannequin resolve, taking me down to sixteen. We resolve Stonecloaker and I bounce the elf. On my turn I play O-Ring and swing for the last 3 damage.\r\n\r\nGames: 5-4, rounds: 2-2\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 5: WG vs WG Aggro\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nHis deck is more aggro and less midrange, focusing on the WG hybrid creatures: Safehold Elite, Kitchen Finks and Wilt-Leaf Cavaliers and Lieges. He also has the Shield of the Oversoul backing up his creatures. The rest of his deck seems to be a smattering of elves, including Imperious Perfect.\r\n\r\nMy creatures are naturally bigger, but that doesn't mean much to an Oblivion Ring. In game one I have him on the defensive, and eventually manage to get a Spectral Force or two to stick, and we shuffle up for game 2.\r\n\r\nI'm boarding: +3 Wispmare, +3 Condemn, -2 Loxodon Warhammer, -2 Cloudthresher, -1 Chameleon Colossus, -1 Oversoul of Dusk.\r\n\r\nIn game two, I keep a hand with white lands and green spells believing that I will surely draw green lands eventually. A recipe for loss obviously! Note to self: Never do that again. I lost to two Wilt-Leaf Lieges and a Safehold Elite.\r\n\r\nIn game three, I play out turn four Spectral Force, turn five Spectral Force and he's forced to lose his guys chump blocking as he has no Rings. Eventually he manages an Oblivion Ring, but I have a Wispmare. Eventually I have out two Lieges, a Birds, a Wispare, a post-persist Finks and two Spectral Force versus his ground based force of 3-4 elf tokens, Llanowar, Treetop, Safehold Elite, Wilt-Leaf Liege and Imperious Perfect. I just chip away in the air with the 2/3 Birds and 3/4 Wispmare. He knows he's going to lose the next turn so he just goes in alpha strike mode hoping I don't block well. Also, he apparently thought the Liege gave his\r\n   \r\n_\r\n    \r\ngreen\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n   \r\nelf tokens +2/+2 instead of +1/+1 so he thought he had enough to take me down from 20. He only had sixteen, and I won the game.\r\n\r\nGames: 7-5, rounds: 3-2\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 6: WG vs UW Reveillark\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nI sigh inwardly when I see the pairings, since I know I'll be facing Reveillark. From experience playing the blue-white combo-control deck, midrange green has close to zero chance of winning. I'm not even going to bother with my mistakes here, though there were many. I lost in two games.\r\n\r\nGames 7-7. Rounds: 3-3\r\n\r\nI think I've lost enough rating points for today and tick drop in the slot. Damn, performing poorly saps out a lot of my energy.\r\n\r\nNext week: Block!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/magic/2008/04/deck-building-for-an-unknown-metagame/\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Savor the Moment\r",

I decided to skip the Shadowmoor Block Inaugural tournament yesterday, but I still showed up in the afternoon at Galleria to look for cards. Luckily, there was a draft signup so I went ahead and gambled some money on my supposed skills in Limited.\r\n\r\nAfter waiting some 3-4 hours for the draft signup to reach 8 people, we got started. I always carry a pair of scissors in my bag now since I'm really bad at opening packs when my hands get sweaty.\r\n\r\nSome select picks:\r\n\r\nPack one, pick one:\r\n   \r\nMossbridge Troll\r\n\r\nIn the removal-light SHM limited format, the Troll is pretty hard to kill for some color combinations. And besides, it's a rare!\r\n\r\nPack one, pick two:\r\n   \r\nWicker Warcrawler\r\n\r\nThere's a group of people I draft with on a semiregular basis; \"Be a man, take the artifact!\" has been one of our running jokes for years now. The thing abut the warcrawler is that many people don't realize that it gets the -1/-1 counter at the end of combat, so the first attack or block is a six, and will often net you card advantage in the form of a chump block.\r\n\r\nPack one, pick three:\r\n   \r\nFlourishing Defenses\r\n\r\nThis card turned out to be nuts whenever I cast it. Two 3/3s with wither bump into each other? Okay, six elf tokens. Wicker Warcrawler? An elf token every turn. Morselhoarder? Two free elf tokens!\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the pack I pick up various scarecrows and red/green men.\r\n\r\nPack two, pick one:\r\n   \r\nReflecting Pool\r\n\r\nWow, cash!\r\n\r\nPack two, pick two:\r\n   \r\nKnollspine Invocation\r\n\r\nAs much a bomb as Stormbind, this led me to red as my secondary color to green, despite the severe lack of removal I was getting.\r\n\r\nI managed to get a\r\n   \r\nBurn Trail\r\n   \r\nand a\r\n   \r\nScuttlemutt\r\n   \r\nlater in this pack.\r\n\r\nPack three, pick one:\r\n   \r\nSwans of Byrn Argoll\r\n\r\nLol, yeah, rare-drafting.\r\n\r\nPrior to this pack I'd already gotten a pair of\r\n   \r\nMorselhoarder\r\n   \r\nand a\r\n   \r\nMudbrawler Raider\r\n   \r\n, so when a\r\n   \r\nRunes of the Deus\r\n   \r\ncame in, I easily scooped it up. I also got two Pili-palas in the third pack, hoping to score a Power of Fire, but no such luck. The Pili-pala were very good though, enabling a splash of white and for some reason people don't realize it's a flier!\r\n   \r\n!--more--\r\n\r\nHere's my final list:\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\ndiv

/div\r\n/div\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, some obvious problems: Nurturer Initiate should have just been Scuzzback Scrapper if I really needed the one-drop; it has more synergy with Runes of the Deus. Old Ghastbark might have been better than Watchwing Scarecrow despite being one mana more expensive.\r\n\r\nI'm amused by the fact that I'm splashing two Aethertow with neither Islands nor Plains.\r\n\r\nBoo to NG for not providing basic lands! I had to desleeve some lands from some deck components I had brought along and had to proxy Islands for Mountains.\r\n\r\nRound one: 2-1 win vs RG\r\n\r\nThis guy was to my right, and since we were counterdrafting each other, he got the better red spells, I think I got the better greens. Still, I would have had an awesome deck had he passed me that Fire-Lit Thicket and those Tatermunge Duos.\r\n\r\nRound two: 0-2 loss vs RB\r\n\r\nLost to too many annoying evasion guys.\r\n\r\nRound three: 2-1 win vs BR\r\n\r\nHe had like 3 Emberstrike Duos and various other small guys, but not much removal. Same general problems with BR in SHM.\r\n\r\nI made a really stupid play in game 3 and it was lucky that I still won despite it. I had Knollspine Invocation out, my opponent had Loch Korrigan and a Scuzzback Marauder with a -1/-1 counter on it. He tapped out for Rattleblaze Scarecrow, of course it would have haste due to the Marauder. I activated Knollspine Invocation for 2 to take out the Marauder, removing the haste and stopping the attack. On my turn, I untap and realize that the 2-cc spell I had discarded to Knollspine was a Smash to Smithereens! I'm so smart.\r\n\r\nLuckily on my turn I drew the sixth land and played out Morselhoarder, getting two elf tokens due to Flourising Defenses. On his turns the elves chump block and he lays down two blockers. On my turn, I show him the Runes and he's at some low number like 9 so the jig is up. He clarifies the implication of double-strike + trample with the judge, and it's lethal as expected.\r\n\r\nI won two packs! The prize rares were\r\n   \r\nSunken Ruins\r\n   \r\nand\r\n   \r\nOversoul of Dusk\r\n   \r\n! Wow... what a haul! Not bad for skipping the constructed tournament on that day.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Mossbridge Troll\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wicker Warcrawler\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Flourishing Defenses\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Reflecting Pool\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Knollspine Invocation\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Burn Trail\r\n [7]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scuttlemutt\r\n [8]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Swans of Byrn Argoll\r\n [9]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Morselhoarder\r\n [10]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Mudbrawler Raider\r\n [11]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Runes of the Deus\r\n [12]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sunken Ruins\r",

Here are some I tried (You'll need some sort of flashcart to use these. Mine is an R4.):\r\n\r\n  Pocket Physics -- a neat little toy app that allows you to draw diagrams on the touch screen that would then become affected by physics. It's a bit like a free-form The Incredible Machine that's portable. It's a bit of work to get a nice physics model done, but there are some available for download, you can just view the work of others if you want. \r\n  Colors! -- a painting/sketching app for the DS, you can create images that have a painting feel to them \r\n  ScummVM DS -- SCUMM was the adventure-game engine that drove a lot of the point-and-click adventure games of the 80s such as the Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion games. Provided you have a copy of those games, ScummVM DS allows you to play all those old games on your DS! \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\nThere's a whole world of homebrew apps/games out there to explore, these were just the ones I could try out in one sitting. Try this post from 4-color-rebellion for some recommendations.\r\n\r\nFor more details, you can also check out the recently concluded Homebrew Week at DS Fanboy \r\n   \r\n.\r\n\r\nNow if you'll excuse me, I'm trying to help Guybrush find Big Whoop... \r\n\r\n [1]: http://tobw.net/index.php?cat_id=3&project=Pocket+Physics\r\n [2]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheIncredibleMachine\r\n [3]: http://www.collectingsmiles.com/colors/\r\n [4]: http://scummvm.drunkencoders.com/\r\n [5]: http://www.4colorrebellion.com/archives/2006/05/21/state-of-the-homebrew-may-2006/\r",

Visually it's a step up from XP the same way XP was a step up from '95. The XP box at work seems so bland to me now.\r\n\r\nThe file manager (Explorer) is very nice, I like the functionality of being able to navigate the address bar by mouse click (though I never used this back in Ubuntu) and the ability to sort files even in thumbnail view. The desktop gadgets are neat but probably not really that useful, though I still keep them around.\r\n\r\nIE7 so far has been tolerable, except that I found out just now that it has Javascript errors when I'm using the WordPress RTE for posting. Also, the Ctrl+K shortcut for the search box is missing, but I still insitinctively use it all the time. I think I'm going to switch to Firefox right after posting. :p\r\n\r\nAll the permission prompts that I had heard people complain about didn't really bother me. They only come up when you need to do administrative-related tasks, and coming from Ubuntu I'm a bit used to it.\r\n\r\nI haven't removed most of the preinstalled Acer crap yet, but I've removed the 90-day trial of Norton Antivirus and replaced it with Avast antivirus.\r\n\r\nOh, Windows Update is prompting me for a restart! It's also my first time working with an OS that has Windows Update enabled, and some people have told me how annoying the restart prompts are especially while playing games. Luckily, I can afford to restart right now.\r\n\r\nAll in all, Vista seems okay, and I believe it's a good upgrade to XP, which has been getting boring to me. I was originally planning on dual-booting this laptop with Linux, but I think I'll stick with Vista for a while.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by PCSecurityExpert on 2008-07-15 21:31:18 +0000\r\nI think OEM vendors have some kind of agreement with McAfee and Norton which\r\n  \r\nforces them to install these antiviruses -- no matter how bad performing they\r\n  \r\nare. If I'm more or less tolerant with McAfee, then Norton is a system killer.\r\n  \r\nI've just come across a report where it's said that Norton slows start-up by\r\n  \r\n50%. Awful! Avast antivirus is much less resource-hungry.",

It's like being good enough to be in movies, but never good enough to be the star. Everyone around you is happy that they know someone who appears in movies, but deep inside you wish you were the star.\r\n\r\nI don't think anyone ever dreams of being above average. Unfortunately most of the time there's a huge gap between \"above average\" and \"excellent\" that requires so much more effort for incremental gain. When looking at that plateau, it may seem insurmountable so many people just settle for being above average.\r\n\r\nI find myself thinking about this now because I'm often faced with one of those plateaus in one aspect of life or another. And when you're there looking at that plateau you need to ask yourself: Is it worth it to devote your time and energy to becoming the best you can be in this particular area?\r\n\r\nMy curse then, is that there are many areas where I consider myself \"above average\", such that it's difficult for me to decide on the path I want to take in life. I don't want to have to choose just one path, I don't want to choose just one area to be excellent in. I'm greedy; I want it all damn it! And this might be why I'm cursed to remain merely above average.\r\n\r\nFor now.",

We stretched game one over 45 minutes of the 50 minute round. I almost made a few mistakes here, such as killing my own men with two firespouts intended to kill Oona -- but the spectators were a bit too obvious that I should've paid only green. I had gotten him down to eight before he went back up to 20 with Dawnglow Infusion. I went down to 1, held on and clawed back to five life. Eventually I won with 13 damage from a Horde of Notions + buddies alpha strike.\r\n\r\nWe tried to play game two in the last five minutes, and he had a quick start and I had a bad draw, but he couldn't finish me in extra turns.\r\n\r\nGame record: 1-0\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 1-0\r\n\r\nRound 2 vs BG (Doran?)\r\n\r\nThis was a nonmatch, as he mulled to five in game one and never recovered. In game two I won easily.\r\n\r\nGame record: 3-0\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 2-0\r\n\r\nRound 3 vs Faeries:\r\n\r\nI actually didn't know how to play this matchup; I figured I should wait for the Bitterblossom on turn 2 with Broken Ambitions, but he wasn't playing anything either so I blinked first, walking my evoked Mulldrifter into his own Broken Ambitions. After which he played BB on his own turn. I don't remember more details, but I lost in two, most probably because I don't really know how to play the matchup.\r\n\r\nGame record: 3-2\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 2-1\r\n\r\nRound 4 vs Faeries:\r\n\r\nThis time I won in two games easily; he never had Bitterblossom and I had aggro starts, I was ahead on all metrics all the time.\r\n\r\nGame record: 5-2\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 3-1\r\n\r\nRound 5 vs Kithkin:\r\n\r\nMy opponent had complained that he had fought Elementals all five rounds -- except I wasn't the usual Elemental deck!\r\n\r\nIn game one, a forge tender ran smack into the Plumeveil, and he never recovered from that.\r\n\r\nIn game two I mulled to five and kept a two-lander with questionable land synergy and quickly lost.\r\n\r\nIn game three, I took some beats but stabilized at 13 after an awesome Mind Spring for five. My notes have the life at 13-23 in his favor, but he had nothing on the board and I had a full grip; he was frustrated and just scooped.\r\n\r\nGame record: 6-3\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record 4-1\r\n\r\nRound six vs Kithkin:\r\n\r\nI easily beat him game one due to no maindeck Forge Tenders, meaning I actually got rid of five or so creatures with a Firespout. In game two I mulliganned and had mana issues. In game three he had something like a God start -- two Forge Tenders, Wizened Cenn, Meadowgrain, Thistledown Liege and a Reveillark under the hideaway land. I eventually ran out of Cryptics to stall and couldn't use the spouts due to the BFTs.\r\n\r\nFinal Game record: 7-4\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nFinal Match record: 4-2\r\n\r\nIt was a small tournament so 4-2 was good enough for 5th place, winning me 4 packs. The rares were: Rage Reflection, Ghastlord of Fugue, Dramatic Entrance and Painter's Servant.",

I was quite wrong.\r\n\r\nFor the LLM draft, I went with a Treefolk-based build around Battlewand Oaks. I luckily opened a Bitterblossom in pack 3 so my splash went to black, gaining additional removal from the Morningtide pack.\r\n\r\nRound one vs U/B was close, we went to game 3. But eventually, he decided to gamble and play\r\n   \r\nStenchskipper\r\n   \r\nwith only a\r\n   \r\nMothdust Changeling\r\n   \r\nas backup. Unfortunately both of my removal cost five and neither were in my hand at that time. I easily lost to the 6/5 flier.\r\n\r\nRound two vs Monowhite Kithkin was close again, but in game 3 I walked into a Coordinated Barrage that resulted in bad trades and was unable to recover.\r\n\r\nRound three I got a bye since there were only seven people in my pod.\r\n\r\n1-2 and no wins (meaning no Limited Points!) was pretty sucky, so I hoped to recover in SSS. I felt my LLM draft was decent, although I could have gotten more black removal in packs 1 and 2. The games I did play were very close and I felt that I made only mostly minor mistakes. Unfortunately, my draft deck seemed too \"fair\", relying on honest attacking creatures to win the game.\r\n\r\nIn SSS, I started out U/W but with the possibility of shifting into red due to second-pick Flame Javelin. I had grabbed early Aethertows and Thistledown Duos, but my mistakes came when I saw two Tattermunge Duos passing by late and my not shifting into the the obviously open R/G. I would realize the mistake in later packs as I would be passed more Tattermunge Duos, Puncture Bolts, Runes of the Deus and the Deus of Calamity itself.\r\n\r\nI lost round four -- I don't even remember the battle anymore. But I was really frustrated with how it turned out, so I dropped from the tournament right then.\r\n\r\nFinal record 1-4: No limited points gained, a bunch lost. Not a good day, obv. Still, the draftaganza was a good experience and hopefully NG will hold more similar events in the future.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Stenchskipper\r",

I actually joined the treasure hunt late, the 2nd question was already released by the time I got wind of it. The site says there are prizes to be won for the people who are able to provide complete answers first; I'm not sure what my odds of winning anything are since (a) I joined late and (b) I can only do the questions during the weekends, typically a few days after they are released.\r\n\r\nStill, for what it's worth, I was able to answer all four questions correctly on the first try. For any programming parts, I wrote up Python scripts to help me through. The problems were pretty good, and also randomly-generated so that you can't just copy the answer from another participant.\r\n\r\nHoping I win something. 😀\r\n\r",

In game one we have a staring contest, building up lands and trading counters over evoked Mulldrifters. I take the early beats and drop to three with him at around fourteen. End of my turn he Mannequins a Thresher and I have no blockers. Crap! I'm dead! However, for some reason he untaps and thinks the Thresher still has summoning sickness so he passes the turn without attacking. On my turn I take it out with a Shriekmaw, then climb back up in life on succeeding turns using Kitchen Finks, eventually managing to take the game.\r\n\r\nGame two The situation is reversed, at the end of his turn I Mannequin Horde of Notions, then use the ability to bring back a Shriekmaw and a Mulldrifter, then swing for lethal on my turn. I explain to him that as long as I untap with a creature, it no longer has summoning sickness.\r\n\r\nGame record: 2-0\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 1-0\r\n\r\nRound two vs Faeries\r\n\r\nThis was the same guy to whom I lost the day before so I was hoping for some payback. In game one I tapped out at a comfortable nine life while he only had a Faerie token and a Mutavault. He swung for three and played Notorious Throng and I had to scoop. In game two, we get into a staring contest basically just laying down lands during the early turns. We get into some counter battles, but between Ponder and Cryptic Command we're basically staying at full hand size. I can't get any advantage as he refuses to let my Mulldrifter resolve. I sweep his side several times, but eventually he manages to get in another Throng to finish me off.\r\n\r\nGame record: 2-2\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 1-1\r\n\r\nRound three vs Monored splash black\r\n\r\nKitchen Finks are at a disadvantage against Puncture Bolts and Boggart Ram-Gangs, but I still manage to put it away in three games, always being careful to stay away from the range of two Flame Javelins. We end game three with me beating down with 3 creatures, him with no black sources and three Eyeblight's Endings in hand.\r\n\r\nGame record: 4-3\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 2-1\r\n\r\nRound 4 vs Kithkin\r\n\r\nIt's the same deck I lost to in round six the previous day, so I'm told. I win game one easily same as yesterday. In game two the sideboarded BFT don't make an appearance and I manage to win that as well.\r\n\r\nGame record: 6-3\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 3-1\r\n\r\nRound 5 vs W/x\r\n\r\nThe first turn plains made me think it was Kithkin, but the second turn Shinewend meant it was something different. I'm unsure what to expect but after seeing Spectral Procession, Wilt-Leaf Liege and Kitchen Finks it was definitely an aggro build with play style similar to Kithkin, except slower to allow for more flexibility. I stabilize at two life with a Cloudthresher under an Oblivion Ring. I manage to win from there, and the opponent later realizes he could have won by playing a Shinewend and taking out the Ring.\r\n\r\nIn game two I'm at fourteen; he swings with Burrenton FT, WL liege and a Kitchen Finks. I block the Liege with a Finks, hoping to finish it off with Nameless Inversion. He plays Mirrorweave on the Liege, hoping to win on the spot; I don't panic and take out the Forge Tender with NI, taking only six damage and getting to kill the Liege. From there I play Mind Spring for four and take control of the game.\r\n\r\nGame record: 8-3\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 4-1\r\n\r\nRound six vs Faeries\r\n\r\nGame one, he mulls to five and is still color-screwed, so I win easily.\r\n\r\nGame two I mull to six and am less color-screwed, but still lose the game.\r\n\r\nGame three was too close; I had him two turns away from losing to his own Bitterblossom, the life was 14-2 in my favor, I had a 2/1 Finks and he had a bunch of Faerie tokens. I play Kitchen Finks so I could survive the next two turns, but he shows me Cryptic Command, bouncing his own Bitterblossom in the process. On his turn he swings for four, taking me to ten. On my turn I topdeck the Firespout, play it for 1GG and he has no permission left. The 2/1 Finks win me the game.\r\n\r\nGame record: 10-4\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 5-1\r\n\r\nFive and one! If I win the next round I can draw into the top eight... \r\n\r\nRound seven is Faeries again! We trade game one and two, and game three I thought I had it lost... \r\n\r\nIt was his turn, the third turn in extra time and I was at nine. I had no chance of winning at this point, but he had Bitterblossom and seven tokens without summoning sickness. I had nothing. He plays Mutavault, his fifth land, then swings with the seven tokens. I would take seven and go down to two, losing on the fifth turn even if I had a sweeper because of the Mutavault. I signal no blockers and prepare to write down \"2\" on my life total... \r\n\r\nHe signals wait. He taps his mutavault and indicates he's animating it. He plays Mirrorweave targetting Mutavault.\r\n\r\nMy hand shoots into the air, \"Judge!\"\r\n\r\nSome explanations later, we get the ruling: the Faeries become lands and are removed from combat!\r\n\r\nI survive into turn four, topdeck a Cloudthresher and sweep away the Faeries. The game ends in a draw.\r\n\r\nGame record: 11-5\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nMatch record: 5-1-1\r\n\r\nMust win in order to top eight. Hopefully I fight anything other than Faeries which has been difficult for me so far (probably because I'm not playing the matchup correctly)\r\n\r\nOf course, round eight is Faeries!\r\n\r\nGame one the first play is Vendillion Clique from his side, followed by two Scions on succeeding turns. I manage to sweep, but by that time I'm at five and lose to his Mutavaults.\r\n\r\nGame two went pretty much the same way (Vendillion into Scion into Scion), except I had Kitchen Finks on the ground to stall the &#8216;vaults. We trade removal and counters for a while, but eventually he manages to tap down my guys with Cryptic Command and swing in with three &#8216;vaults.\r\n\r\nFinal Game record: 11-7\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nFinal Match record: 5-2-1\r\n   \r\n\r\n   \r\nFinish: 17th, winning two packs. The packs contained Wheel of Sun and Moon and Order of Whiteclay.\r\n\r\nA bit disappointed, since I had begged out of Father's Day dinner in order to finish the tournament since I was doing well. Still, it's a decent finish and brings to an end my month-long streak of bad tournament results. The Commandments deck is exhausting yet fun to play, now all I need to do is figure out the Faeries matchup... \r\n\r\nNext week: I don't know if I can play in the last GPT.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Ritch on 2008-06-17 01:07:23 +0000\r\nUh. Decklist needs fixing? The Plumeveils are still in the board and I see no\r\n  \r\nhint of those Macabres. 😀 5-2-1 in a GPT is a nice record.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2008-06-17 02:55:24 +0000\r\nCorrected... I forgot to edit after copy and paste.\r\n\r\n5-2-1 is a good record yes, but I want to do better!",

I saw the following in cinemas:\r\n\r\nKung Fu Panda -- complete AWESOMENESS. I drank the Kool-Aid all the way on this one.\r\n\r\nIndiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull -- classic Indy goodness.\r\n\r\nIncredible Hulk -- Edward Norton is cast brilliantly here, a choice on the same level as Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man. And they addressed the issue of Hulk's stretchy pants!\r\n\r\nWanted -- The story is decent, although the Loom of Fate weirded me out a bit. But let's face it, you're really here for the kickass gun battles, and the movie pretty much delivers. Remember back when bullet time from the Matrix was a big deal? The gun battles here are like a generation up from that. I love the gunfight through the factory, and the train battle was pretty much insane. The ending was meh, but at least it wasn't some generic \"good guy wins and gets the girl\" (er, spoiler much?)\r\n\r\nSince I now have a laptop, I've also been able to watch more movies on DVD as well:\r\n\r\n21 -- it's undeniably a geek movie. If you want to watch it, you need a geek with you to explain how card counting in Blackjack works. It's pretty good, and also doesn't have any predictable \"hero wins it all\" ending. Based on a true story, but I think the win rate may be highly exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThe Kingdom -- we actually just needed something to watch. Something with guns and explosions. This movie did the job. Jamie Fox and Jennifer Gardner are FBI agents who went into Saudi Arabia to hunt down a terrorist. The nice thing is that they don't portray the Arabian police as incompetent and are instead useful allies, i.e. the Americans don't hog all the work.\r\n\r\nI've also managed to watch a few random crap movies as background noise (Monster in Law, Norbit -- god, HBO seems to be showing this stupid movie all the time!)\r\n\r\nUpcoming movies I'm looking forward to: Dark Knight, obv. Although Hancock seems interesting as well.",

To anyone who starts playing MTG, the ability to build your own decks has always been one of the primary appeals. For this reason, every MTG player would like to think that they have in themselves some level of deckbuilding \"skills\" and that using netdecks should be treated as a loss of pride in one's own work.\r\n\r\nI don't feel strongly about this issue; I've used both netdecks and my own homebrew designs in tournaments before. Checking my own stats (one advantage of this blog is that I have a record of every tournament I ever played): I have a 59% match win rate when using a netdeck, and 54% when using my own homebrew designs. There's a statistically signficant difference, so I can't claim that I am an awesome deck designer. (Maybe in the future.)\r\n\r\nI think that netdecking makes more sense the less time you can dedicate to Magic. For people like me who barely have one hour a week to playtest before playing in tournaments, netdecking makes a lot of sense. Definitely, if you have the time and inclination to design and develop your own original decks, you should do so, especially since having a Filipino-designed deck taking the world stage would be a big source of pride to local Magic players.\r\n\r\nBut for people like me especially at times like these when I'm busy with work, if I try bringing a self-designed deck to a tournament with minimal preparation, usually disaster happens . For the time being, I should focus on learning the ins and outs of the known decks so that I can make less mistakes and choose a good deck to play in the coming GP Trials and Nationals Qualifiers.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.neutralgrounds.net/forums/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/magic/2008/05/regionals-2008/\r",

Like every single time I would make a big purchase I waffled undecisively between buying and not buying a laptop for the first four days, only to succumb at the very last minute when a model with an insane price became available.\r\n\r\nOn 7:30pm of the last day of the sale, I picked up an Acer Aspire 4920 unit with the following specs:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIntel® Centrino® Duo Mobile Processor Technology, Intel ® Core™2 Duo Processor T7100 (1.8GHz, 2Mb L2 Cache, 800MHz FSB)\r\n\r\nMobile Intel® PM965 Express Chipset, Built-in Intel® Wireless WiFi Link 4965AGN 802.11a/b/g/Draft-N\r\n\r\nGenuine Microsoft® Windows Vista™ Home Premium\r\n\r\n1GB DDR2 533MHz Memory/ 160GB SATA HDD (Extended Power)\r\n\r\n14.1&#8243; WXGA TFT CrystalBrite LCD (8ms response time)\r\n\r\nBuilt-in New Acer CrystalEye WebCam supporting Acer PrimalLite Technology\r\n\r\nBuilt-in Dolby® Digital Surround Sound (DLNA Certified)\r\n\r\nBuilt-in Bluetooth 2.0+ EDR Technology\r\n\r\nBuilt-in 5in1 Card Reader\r\n\r\nBuilt-in Super Multi Double Layer Drive\r\n\r\nBuilt-in 10/100/1000 Gigabit LAN/56k Modem\r\n\r\nATI Mobility™ Radeon® X2500 with up to 1GB of HyperMemory™ Technology (256MB dedicated Memory, 768MB Shared Memory)\r\n\r\nNew Acer Arcade Deluxe Multimedia Software\r\n\r\nAcer GridVista Technology\r\n\r\nAcer Empowering Technology with Free\r\n\r\nMicrosoft® Office Home and Student 2007 (Trial Version for 60 days)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI felt guilty about the impulse buy for a few hours; I didn't really need a laptop of course, and I could upgrade one of the home desktops into a top of the line gaming machine for the same price. Still, I've always wanted a laptop and if I went by that logic I'd never have one!\r\n\r\nSo yeah I'm using it now, I also bought and setup a wifi router at home as well, so now I get to blog while watching a DVD of 21. I'm also back to using a Windows OS at home, since the laptop comes with Windows Vista Home Premium. I think I'm going to try using Vista and IE for a while and see how long before I decide to wipe and install into an XP/Ubuntu dual boot. At least I get to experience the thrill of being a Windows shill for a while. 😀",

Opera is neat and all, but I don't see any features that are so awesome that they can't be done in Firefox (with some extensions maybe).\r\n\r\nMy favorite feature is I guess the Speed Dial page; where opening a new tab displays a customizable table of common websites you visit. Opera also provides a function to zoom in or out of any web page (don't know if Firefox has a similar extension). Supposedly Opera is also the fastest in terms of browser rendering; I didn't perform any benchmarks, but I didn't notice any significant difference either.\r\n\r\nThere are quite a few cons though. In particular:\r\n\r\n  The standard WordPress rich text editor doesn't work correctly; I had to use the plain text editor when posting using Opera.\r\n  Some Google properties such as Google Docs and Google Notebook don't work correctly\r\n  Flash content that renders before the rest of the page does not correctly move into the proper position once rendering is complete\r\n\r\nThe WordPress and Google support are deal-breakers for me, without those problems I would have considered keeping Opera as my primary browser for a while. As it is, I'm switching back to Firefox 3.0.",

Despite the hectic work schedule and the fact that spoilers have failed to impress me, I managed to wrangle a Saturday off to hit Robinson's Galleria for the Eventide Prerelease.\r\n\r\nSo we show up early and join the first flight. I open and register a Shadowmoor tournament pack with next to nothing in terms of decent cards. I think the best removal it had was an Aethertow, and none after that. I was glad that usually small set Prereleases required passing the tournament pack. Naturally, after I was done registering, the judge told us that for our table, we would keep the tournament pack. Doh!\r\n\r\nI opened my three Eventide boosters and saw two unexciting rares(\r\n   \r\nEndless Horizons\r\n   \r\n,  and\r\n   \r\nGlamerdye\r\n   \r\n) and one mediocre one (\r\n   \r\nPyrrhic Revival\r\n   \r\n). I did notice I had quite a bit of playable R/W hyrbids though, including two\r\n   \r\nBelligerent Hatchling\r\n   \r\n, which would be great with a\r\n   \r\nFlourishing Defenses\r\n   \r\nI had in the tourney pack. I also had two\r\n   \r\nEdge of Divinity\r\n   \r\n, which seems awesome except I had like two B/W hybrid creatures.\r\n\r\nI decided to go mostly white, splashing green for some acceleration and utility creatures. At first glance,\r\n   \r\nCinder Pyromancer\r\n   \r\nseemed awesome as well so I was willing to put in one mountain just to splash him. I had trouble deciding what to cut so I stuck with 17 lands (didn't have any good Retracers anyway)\r\n\r\nMy decklist:\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"decklist\"\r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n    li class=\"header\"\r\n      Lands\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      12 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Plains\"Plains/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Forest\"Forest/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Mountain\"Mountain/a\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n    li class=\"header\"\r\n      Creatures\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Apothecary Initiate\"Apothecary Initiate/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Ballynock Cohort\"Ballynock Cohort/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Farhaven Elf\"Farhaven Elf/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wickerborough Elder\"Wickerborough Elder/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rhys the Redeemed\"Rhys the Redeemed/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Safehold Elite\"Safehold Elite/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Puresight Merrow\"Puresight Merrow/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Harvest Gwyllion\"Harvest Gwyllion/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Belligerent Hatchling\"Belligerent Hatchling/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Duergar Assailant\"Duergar Assailant/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Hobgoblin Dragoon\"Hobgoblin Dragoon/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Painter's Servant\"Painter's Servant/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Pili-Pala\"Pili-Pala/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Tatterkite\"Tatterkite/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Cinder Pyromancer\"Cinder Pyromancer/a\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n    li class=\"header\"\r\n      Other Spells:\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Aethertow\"Aethertow/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Armored Ascension\"Armored Ascension/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Barkshell Blessing\"Barkshell Blessing/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Double Cleave\"Double Cleave/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Flourishing Defenses\"Flourishing Defenses/a\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scourge of the Nobilis\"Scourge of the Nobilis/a\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  div style=\"clear:both\"\r\n  /div\r\n/div\r\n\r\nMy round one opponent thankfully read Cinder Pyromancer for me out loud when I played it and I realized it didn't actually hit creatures (not as awesome as I thought!) and I lost the first game due to pretty much having only a dorky 0/1. I boarded it out for a Snakeform (which I would do so for the rest of the rounds), then proceeded to win games two and three in very tight races.\r\n\r\nIn round two I thought I had game three in the bag when I managed to play turn one Duergar Assailant into turn three Scourge of the Nobilis\r\n   \r\nand he had no immediate answers. I managed to get the life totals to 36-8 in my favor before I foolishly traded my heroic dwarf in combat and he stabilized with a Voracious Hatchling in play, which then proceeded to chase the life totals to to the other side of the board. I made several bad plays with the Hatchling, especially when he swung the 3/3 Hatchling into my 3/3 first-striking Kithkin with one mana open. I instinctively blocked, and of course he had the scar! This was very early on, and I don't think he would have been able to win without the Hatchling, so I should have just gone all-in and mass blocked with everyone. I lose the match 1-2.\r\n\r\nRound three, my opponent seemed new to tournaments, so I found myself holding back at some points. Flores said Mercy will kill you! but luckily it didn't and I won in two games.\r\n\r\nRound four, and I'm paired up with Switch, who cardpools with me and was one of the people I came to the prerelease with. Not cool, but we don't have a choice. We get the pack either way, so we just play for the win on the record. I get in an aggro start -- \"I want to win the game,\" showing Scourge of the Nobilis -- and win in two.\r\n\r\nSwitch and I win five packs between the two of us, but we open more unexciting rares (R/U liege for the lose!). So far I'm still not too excited about Eventide, or Magic in general these past few weeks to be honest. I'm more interested in Block than Standard, but Block seems to be dominated by Faeries, which I find annoying. I hope Eventide shakes up the block meta enough so that it's more varied by the time Grand Prix Manila rolls around.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Endless Horizons\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Glamerdye\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Pyrrhic Revival\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Belligerent Hatchling\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Flourishing Defenses\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Edge of Divinity\r\n [7]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Cinder Pyromancer\r\n [8]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Snakeform\r\n [9]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Duergar Assailant\r\n [10]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scourge of the Nobilis\r\n [11]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Voracious Hatchling\r",

As far as I know, they contain copies of old TV series/anime I used to watch and backups of my old hard drives from time long past. (I'm pretty sure I still have backups of my drive contents from the IRC laboratory in UP.)\r\n\r\nI'm wondering whether I should bother going through them to check which ones are already useless (as some certainlty already are). If I'm going to rearchive them into a different format it would probably take more than a week to reburn them to DVDs. But DVDs are soon to be obsolete with the coming of Blu-Ray, maybe I should just buy another external drive and archive them there? I could easily buy another hard drive with the capacity of somewhere around 200-300 CDs.\r\n\r\nI've had a pack rat mentality ever since I first bought a CD burner back in the day, but lately I've found myself unenthusiastic about backing up _anything _to optical media. I had to backup the factory settings on this laptop to a DVD (because the Acer software didn't have an option to backup to an external HD), but aside from that I haven't burned any discs in half a year maybe.\r\n\r\nMaybe it's just due to my bad experience with failed CD writers and DVD writers that are slow as hell to burn, but I've pretty much given up on optical media. High failure rates, low life expectancy, insanely long writing times and difficulty of transfer and storage, I probably would prefer an additional external hard drive. Granted, hard drives fail as well, but at least you didn't spend a hundred thousand hours writing stuff to it in case it does.\r\n\r\nOr I could just (heaven forbid) toss out most of the stuff I normally archive; TV and anime episodes especially. After all, when was the last time I went through all the old episodes of Rurouni Kenshin? I barely have enough time to watch the current shows I follow, there's probably no chance of me watching those old shows again. And even if I do get a hankering to watch season one of _Smallville _again, it's not like it would be hard to find either online or IRL.\r\n\r\nOne could argue that I could keep the copies on disc in case someone wants to borrow them from me. But frankly, every other person now keeps his own stash of old episodes, and there are better people to borrow from than me.\r\n\r\nSide note: I'm pretty sure the tendency to archive, compile and categorize everything is a symptom of NADD.\r\n\r\nI'm almost done convincing myself now, maybe I _will _toss out those old discs... \r\n\r\n [1]: www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2003/07/10/nadd.html\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by noems on 2008-07-15 09:39:59 +0000\r\nhow about donating some of your copies to kapal-muks leechers like me? 😛\r\n  \r\ndepends ofcourse on what you have...  kenshin would be nice since i haven't\r\n  \r\nseen it 😀\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2008-07-15 22:43:42 +0000\r\nI actually \\do\\ have some episodes of Kenshin, but it's not complete, and the\r\n  \r\ndiscs are really old and I'm not sure where they are (daming rason :p)",

I've been busy for the past two weeks so was not able to think of Magic during that time period... \r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 1\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n: PWC Special vs Demigod deck wins\r\n\r\nI had actually assembled the Demigod deck wins deck the day before, intending to play it, but later changed my mind when I decided I wanted to play something with Cryptic Command. Going in, I had an idea that my matchup against red was not very good (same as Faeries I guess), so I groaned inwardly when my opponent started with a mountain and a Figure of Destiny. This was not a good matchup to play my first game with this deck. I lost the two games without putting up much of a fight.\r\n\r\nGames: 0-2, Matches: 0-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 2:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nPWC Special vs BRg Goblins\r\n\r\nApparently, the \"g\" here is for the flying side of Firespout. My opponent started game one with Mountain, Tattermunge Maniac. I play a land and pass. He swings with Maniac, I drop to 18. I play another land and pass. He swings with Maniac, I drop to 16. He prowls out Earwig Squad (!) and I lost 3 Cryptic Commands from my deck. EOT, Nameless Inversion on the Earwig Squad. I play a land and a Banneret. He swings with the Maniac again. I don't want to trade my mana discount for 2 points of damage, so I let it through and drop to 14. Obviously, he has a second Earwig Squad, this time taking out 3 Reejereys from my deck (I was holding the fourth Cryptic Command, obv.) I play another Nameless Inversion for 1 black mana, then untap and lay down a Bitterblossom. Quite possibly a mistake, as he then plays a Squeaking Pie Sneak and a Mad Auntie, then swing with the Maniac for 3. Next turn he plays a second Mad Auntie, and my lone Faerie token won't be able to hold off those hordes. I scoop for game two.\r\n\r\nI sigh and wonder if I'll be going home early. I board out 1 Bitterblossom, 1 Mirror Entity, bringing in 2 Eyeblight's Ending.\r\n\r\nThe second game goes quick; he doesn't have much action and I have a turn 2 Bitterblossom. I hold him off with Peppersmokes and Nameless Inversions while accumulating Faeries, then bring down the surprise Mirror Entity to win.\r\n\r\nGame three is anticlimatic, as he draws no black sources and my fish easily stomp over him.\r\n\r\nGames: 2-3, Matches: 1-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 3:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nPWC Special vs Faeries\r\n\r\nHe mulls to six in game one, and I have a Bitterblossom first. He gets me down to one, but I resolve a Mirror Entity and the tokens swarm in for twelve damage to win the game.\r\n\r\nHe mulls to five and I don't take a single point of damage in this game.\r\n\r\nGames: 4-3, Matches: 2-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 4:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nPWC Special vs Doran\r\n\r\nI win the first game since my Bitterblossom came out before his. I board in Wispmares for his Blossoms.\r\n\r\nGame two I lose to a turn four Chameleon Colossus that I have no answer for.\r\n\r\nGame three I made a play mistake that may have cost me the game. He had Doran out and was beating down, I had Wispmare and Nameless Inversion in hand but didn't play out the Wispmare, still hoping to catch a Bitterblossom (which I later found he sided out!) After passing the turn, I realized I could've killed Doran with those two cards and the Wispmare would survive to counterattack. I did that play the following turn and got rid of Doran, then started rallying with a Bitterblossom. We hit the time limit here, but due to Bitterblossom I would die in turn four of extra time; meaning I had to win with a lethal attack on turn two. It's turn one; I'm at two life and he has no blockers; he plays out Treefolk Harbinger and tutors for Crib Swap, putting it on top. That Crib Swap didn't matter; what mattered was the Crib Swap he had in hand. On turn two, during my upkeep, I drop to one life and he turns one of the active Faeries into a changeling, and suddenly I'm short by one point of damage to win the game (the Harbinger can block my ground guy!). I need to topdeck: any sort of removal (to clear the blocker) or Wispmare (to clear the Bitterblossom) or Cryptic Command. I go into my draw step and rip... a swamp.\r\n\r\nI'm signing the result slip and I keep thinking about if I had played that Wispmare a turn earlier, I would've had an extra point of damage to work with... \r\n\r\nGames: 5-5, Matches -2\r\n\r\nAt this point, I'm thinking of going home and back to the metaphorical drawing board, but the people I'm playing with convince me to keep going.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 5:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nPWC Special vs Monoblue Merfolk/Wizards\r\n\r\nHooray, someone actually made a deck with the Sage of Fables/Glen Elendra Archmage combination!\r\n\r\nI lose game one for some reason, but then I board in Pollen Lullabies. I never win the clash on these things, but the fog effect is more than enough to win me games two and three.\r\n\r\nGames: 7-6, Matches: 3-2\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRoubd 6:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nPWC Special vs Doran\r\n\r\nGame one he has only two lands for like five turns, so it's a blowout.\r\n\r\nGame two he puts up a fight and we reach a stall where has Doran and Vexing Shusher on the ground at nine life, I'm at ten life with Bitterblossom, some faeries and some fish on the ground. On his turn he declines the attack and instead goes for Profane Command for eight (not even reserving mana for the Shusher!), losing me 8 life and taking out one of my Reejereys. He figures he'll just stall the ground with Doran and Shusher and let my own Bitterblossom take me down. I've been chump blocking the Doran with Faerie tokens for several turns now, so he figures I have no removal among the two cards in my hand. He finds out he's wrong when I show two Eyeblight's Ending at EOT, leaving him open. I swing with everyone without even counting, and it's exactly nine points of damage, enough to win the game.\r\n\r\nGames: 9-6, Matches: 4-2\r\n\r\nOne more round, rankings are up and I'm at 22. Top 16 still within reach!\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 7:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nPWC Special vs Red/Black Demigod Deck Wins\r\n\r\nGame one I got hit with a Stigma Lasher, but the Stigma has no effect on me. I stabilize at around 10 life with a blossom in play and manage to take the game.\r\n\r\nGame two he goes turn one Figure of Destiny; turn two attack, pump; turn three Ram-Gang, attack for 5, etc. I make a misplay when I let one of my tribal lands come into play tapped on turn two (instead of leaving mana open for the Nameless Inversion in my hand.)\r\n\r\nGame three is too close, but I correctly counter a Flame Javelin when it matters, leaving him only with a Puncture Blast to shoot me when I'm at five (with Bitterblossom in play of course!) the turn before I swing for lethal.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nFinal Record:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nGames: 11-7, Matches: 5-2\r\n\r\nX-2 finish is good enough for me to land in the 16th spot, and I win... 3 boosters! The only good rare I get is Cascade Bluffs.\r\n\r\nThis deck is awesome and fun to play, but having Bitterblossom out against red or doran is really scary and leads to quite close finishes. I don't know yet about the Faerie matchup (only fought one, but seems positive) and the Kithkin matchup (none encountered!), although I think the Pollen Lullaby would work well against the Kith.\r\n\r\nNext week: PTQ Berlin!",

I wasn't really sure what to expect, as I've never attended any such conference before, and I've never been particularly involved with the local developer community, but I said I'd go anyway, I figured it'd probably be fun.\r\n\r\nThe event was held at the Orient Square building at the offices of Exist Global and Morph Labs, who sponsored the event. I was a bit worried since I'm going in without having a presentation, although everyone is encouraged to present. Turns out I needn't have worried -- over 80 people attended the event, there wouldn't have been enough time for everyone to present! \r\n\r\nAll in all, the talks were interesting, with a wide range of technical topics discussed involving multiple programming languages including C++, Java, Ruby and Python (with much playful jeering between the many Ruby advocates and the few Java developers). There was even a short comedy sketch by Mario Carreon.\r\n\r\nIt felt good getting to know the community and meet some new people and see the cool (and geeky) things local developers are doing. Although I code day in and day out for work, I could probably still learn a lot from the development community. The uptake of newer technologies is a lot faster in the community than at work, so somehow it's a refreshing change of pace.\r\n\r\nHmm... I wonder if I would be able to rustle up something to present at the next Barcamp?\r\n\r\n [1]: http://devblog.michaelgalero.com/\r\n [2]: http://barcamp.org/BarCampManila\r\n [3]: http:// \"http://www.exist.com/\"\r\n [4]: http://www.mor.ph/\r\n [5]: http://mayhemtoledo.blogspot.com/\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Bry on 2008-08-22 23:31:21 +0000\r\nUptake of new technology is pretty much limited by business considerations,\r\n  \r\nbut it's still no excuse to limit expanding developers' horizons.\r\n  \r\nUnfortunately the current trend of us moving towards generalization of skills\r\n  \r\nover specialization pretty much screws up the progress department -- we end up\r\n  \r\nwith engineers who have a broad range of outdated unpolished skills than\r\n  \r\nengineers with less, but more honed, skills.\r\n\r\nCoding day-in-day-out also tends to give a false sense of \"experience\". As\r\n  \r\nI've said to Keis a couple of times already, \"There's a difference between 10\r\n  \r\nyears of experience and 1 year of experience ten times over\". Even looking at\r\n  \r\nmy own code a year ago makes me facepalm at how little effort we spend in\r\n  \r\nmaking sure that our \"tools\"/\"saws\" are sharp.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2008-08-22 23:51:01 +0000\r\nBry: This is a very good thing to discuss, but we need to do it on the\r\n  \r\ninternal network, where we're more likely to have an impact. Think about how\r\n  \r\nto introduce the topic in Rushing Recklessly, I'll surely reply. 😀\r\n\r\n Comment by Bry on 2008-08-23 21:54:32 +0000\r\nProblem is, we've been making too much noise recently that it's possible that\r\n  \r\npeople would dismiss this as yet another random rabble. XP We have to get the\r\n  \r\ntiming right...  and possibly gather surveys or statistics or whatever first to\r\n  \r\ndrive points home.\r\n\r\n(Posting about this stuff externally has a different impact -- it hints that\r\n  \r\nthere's already a small group of people initiating changes inside a company\r\n  \r\nwherein changes were traditionally dictated only by the core group. Hehehe... \r\n  \r\n)\r\n\r\nComment by haellopez on 2008-09-01 16:14:08 +0000\r\nNice to hear you enjoyed the first BarCamp Manila, Roy!\r\n\r\nHope to see you again next time.\r\n\r\nregards,\r\n\r\nleah\r\n\r\n Comment by Roy on 2008-09-07 23:40:37 +0000\r\nThanks Leah, I hope so too, I learned a lot!",

I decided to write a simple message board application.\r\n\r\nI wrote the message board pretty quickly using Django; it took me about 2-3 hours to have a bare-bones message board up and running. (I was watching Speed Racer at the same time.) The UI is horrendous of course, but it's functional, with categories and topics, etc.\r\n\r\nNow to deploy the message board app somewhere. After a bit of searching around, I couldn't find any suitable free Django webhosting. So I went with the backup plan: I'd upload the project to the Google App Engine.\r\n\r\nI've had a Google App Engine account for a while now, but haven't done anything with it yet. Unfortunately, a Django app can't be ported directly to GAE as Google has their own datastore implementation which won't work with Django's models. So I spent the rest of the day porting/rewriting the message board app for use with GAE. Google has their own guide for this sort of porting here: Running Django on Google App Engine.\r\n\r\nSome problems encountered when porting:\r\n\r\n  Can't seem to use the list_detail generic view; I get errors about undefined user attribute on the request \r\n  Sometimes after editing a view, I get random \"NoneType has no attibute get\" errors. Restarting the dev_appserver fixes this. \r\n  Unlike Django, GAE models don't have an \"id\" primary key. Instead, you must use object.key() which returns some sort of hash string (making for very inconvenient urls) \r\n  I'm having errors raised during 404s; the problem is mentioned in this thread which should already be fixed but I'm still encountering it. I'll investigate it later. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe final product is here: Random Encounters Message Boards . I don't know who would actually use the site, but I think there's some people I know reading this blog who wouldn't be able to resist testing it!\r\n\r\nThe next step would be to improve the UI of the app!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.google.com.ph/url?sa=t&ct=res&cd=1&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.djangoproject.com%2F&ei=x6OySMHXJYvQ6gP-t93-Dw&usg=AFQjCNGfxYhHSLrgk6aVrm5Bbc2ozc89rA&sig2=6Zd2UWQL7gEYK7d6SsY2Hg\r\n [2]: http://code.google.com/appengine/\r\n [3]: http://www.djangobook.com/en/1.0/\r\n [4]: http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/django.html\r\n [5]: http://random-encounters.appspot.com/forum/cat/CxIIQ2F0ZWdvcnkYAww/\r\n [6]: /forum/cat/CxIIQ2F0ZWdvcnkYAww/\r",

No such luck, see my results. I was eliminated in the second online round. That I managed to get there at all was surprising considering the level of difficulty.\r\n\r\nI'm not really a com-sci guy, so I'm weak with regards to algorithms, I don't always know what the best approach for particular classes of problems -- I usually just brute force it then try to optimize based on my on-the-spot analysis of each problem. It seemed it wasn't enough; there were a lot of hardcore guys who were able to get perfect scores, and I salute them.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure whether I'll still participate next time, as the problems don't seem to be geared towards someone of my skillset. Still, the fact that I managed to pass 3 rounds (including the qualifier) indicates some potential for winning. And I was one of only two Filipinos who made it to round 2! Good luck to the last guy... \r\n\r\nAfter the code jam, I'm thinking of taking a look at TopCoder.com which hosts weekly programming contests. I'm not sure whether I'll really have time, but I'll probably try it once or twice to see how well I fare.\r\n\r\nThis was a very humbling experience; even though I consider myself a pretty good programmer, there's always someone better.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/\r",

As is usual for me, I lacked playtesting; with the justification that these PTQS\r\n   \r\n_\r\n    \r\nwere\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n   \r\nmy playtesting for the GP.\r\n\r\nTournament report follows! My memory is a bit sparse, so I'll gloss over some of the details.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 1\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n: PWC Special vs GRBW Persist\r\n\r\nI won this in three games. The opponent's deck was very rogue... tons of persist creatures: Murderous Redcap, Kitchen Finks, Twilight Shepherd... and\r\n   \r\nRendclaw Troll\r\n   \r\n. Yeah, look it up.\r\n\r\nGames: 2-1, Matches: 1-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 2:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nPWC Special vs Kithkin/Mirror Master\r\n\r\nOoh, my first Kithkin matchup with this deck! Let's see how I do. The following picture from my life total notes should explain it clearly: \r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-468\" title=\"picture0002\" src=\"/files/uploads/2008/08/picture0002.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"375\" / \r\n\r\nLong version: I lost the first game quite badly.\r\n\r\nIn the second game, I managed to stabilize and race. My army had been tapped low by Pollen Lullaby and the guys weren't going to untap. All I had was a Mirror Entity. He was on six and I was at nine (see the life totals in the image!) He had six spirit tokens and a random kithkin (I think it was a Meadowgrain).\r\n\r\nSo he plays Ajani, pumps 'em all and swings for the kill. I show my own Pollen Lullaby and we clash: He shows a land, I show... \r\n   \r\ncard\r\n    \r\nCryptic Command!{/CARD]. I've practically won; despite Ajani's vigilance, I could tap down his army with the Command (and bounce Ajani), and the effect from Pollen Lullaby still applies so they won't untap before my army gets another swing.\r\n\r\nSo he says done, I don't untap and draw my Cryptic Command. At this point, I have seven lands in play and an active Mirror Entity. I look at the life totals and see he's at six. Somehow, what goes through my head is that the Entity could kill him in one swing. So I did! And I immediately pumped for seven!\r\n\r\nThe spirit tokens were all of course, still quite untapped as I had not yet played the Cryptic Command. T_T\r\n\r\nWow, what a lapse. I had to write \"MISPLAY\" in all caps so that I never forget.\r\n\r\nGames: 2-3, Matches: 1-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n     \r\nRound 3:\r\n    \r\n** \r\n    \r\nPWC Special vs Demigod Red\r\n\r\nI got lucky in both games 2 and 3 as he drew far too many land and couldn't finish me off.\r\n\r\nGames: 5-5, Matches: 2-1\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the next round, I did a few playtest games with Joel \"gjarkeld\" Bantilles playing Kithkin, so I could get a better feel for the matchup. I don't usually name drop here, pero gusto raw ni Joel mabanggit sa blog ko e!\r\n\r\n**\r\n     \r\nRound 4:\r\n    \r\n** \r\n    \r\nPWC Special vs Kithkin/Mirrormaster\r\n\r\nSecond time around, I have a better idea how to fight the matchup. The main defensive key in game one is the Banneret into Sower opening. Even if they kill the Sower, it's like you time walked them since they didn't do anything for a turn. If you do get to untap with the Sower, you're iin good shape. I won game one this way.\r\n\r\nFor game two, I sided into board control:\r\n\r\n-4 Merfolk Reejerey, -2 Peppersmoke, -1 Mirror Entity, -1 Bitterblossom, +2 Hallowed Burial, +2 Shriekmaw, +2 Eyeblight's Ending, +2 Pollen Lullaby\r\n\r\nI pulled out the Reejereys because I didn't want him to be a Mirrorweave target. (More on this in round seven!)\r\n\r\nI won game two in three quick swings according to my notes.\r\n\r\nGames: 7-5, Matches: 3-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n     \r\nRound 5:\r\n    \r\n** \r\n    \r\nPWC Special vs Justice Toast\r\n\r\nI remember reading somewhere that Justice Toast was an underdog to Merfolk, so I wasn't too worried. I figured as long as I could stick a Bitterblossom or hit the Merfolk aggro engine, I should be fine. None of those things happened in two games!\r\n\r\nGames: 7-7, Matches: 3-2\r\n\r\nHay... I was thinking of dropping at this point, but I figured I needed more play experience for the GP (I don't think I'll be able to play in the last 2 Sunday GPTs)\r\n\r\n**\r\n     \r\nRound 6:\r\n    \r\n** \r\n    \r\nPWC Special vs Kithkin (again)\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure whether he was in fact playing Mirror Master since in game one he showed me only the Goldmeadow tapper and Rise of the Hobgoblins and a million plains. I boarded -2 Peppersmoke, +2 Hallowed Burial since I wasn't sure.\r\n\r\nI won both games off the Banneret into Sower plan, since he didn't draw any Unmakes.\r\n\r\nGames: 9-7, Matches: 4-2\r\n\r\n**\r\n     \r\nRound 7:\r\n    \r\n** \r\n    \r\nPWC Special vs Kithkin yet again\r\n\r\nI was expecting I would win round 5 since my tendency seems to be to gravitate towards a 5-2 record. Unluckily I was paired againt Joel (whom I mentioned above; dapat daw sabihin ko \"Hayup yung si Joel!\")\r\n\r\nIn game one he dropped me to below 10 quickly, but I stabilized a bit with a Bitterblossom. He was still at 20 and I had an entity, so I figured I needed to get a creature advantage and then entity him to death. I thought about it for a bit, then played a second Bitterblossom. I was hoping that either I would draw a Cryptic Command or he would have 1-2 turns without drawing creatures, in which case the Bitterblossom advantage would be enough. Unfortunately I went to as low as 2 and we still had equal counts and the next draw was a land, so I scooped for game two.\r\n\r\nI went with the same board plan as round 4 here, bringing out the Reejereys.\r\n\r\nIn game two I hit every Kithkin with removal as soon as it game down, then went into Bitterblossom mode, and we were racing again. I eventually won due to winning a Pollen Lullaby clash.\r\n\r\nIn game three, he had a quick start and all I had were Bitterblossoms and Sage's Dousings. Even if had drawn a Sower to stop the tide, he had Moonglove Extract and Unmake in hand.\r\n\r\nJoel commented that I should have boarded out the Dousings, and instead kept in the Reejereys (more creatures). In retrospect he was probably right, especially since I was on the draw.\r\n\r\nI shook my fist at him and swore vendetta (not really), and then signed the match slip for my disappointing finish.\r\n\r\n**\r\n     \r\nFinal Record:\r\n    \r\n** \r\n\r\nGames: 10-9, Matches: 4-3\r\n\r\n**\r\n     \r\nAbout the deck:\r\n    \r\n** \r\n\r\nRight now, I'd say there's about a 60-70% chance I'll be playing this deck at the Grand Prix (even though I've been known to make deck switches at the last minute)! I went 2-2 against Kithkin today, and 2-1 against other decks. One of the Kithkin losses was arguably due to sheer stupidity/lack of focus, so there's definitely room for improvement there that should come with practice.\r\n\r\nNow to figure out the QnT matchup... \r\n   \r\n/card\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/magic/2008/08/2008-philippine-open-block-top-16/\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rendclaw Troll\r",

There aren't enough tables, so around 40% of the players need to wait for tables to be freed up before they can play. As you can imagine, this makes for long rounds, around 1 hour and 45 minutes each.\r\n\r\nRound 1 vs Kithkin: 0-2 loss\r\n\r\nAs usual, I got trampled in game one and managed to fight him off in game two only to lose by the slimmest of margins.\r\n\r\nRound 2 vs Elementals: 1-2 loss\r\n\r\nThe card advantage off Mulldrifters (and Mannequin'ed Mulldrifters) really hurts here. I can hold off his forces and manage to get a Hallowed Burial to take away all his guys in game three, but he has a full grip so he just untaps and shows me the Horde of Notions while I'm at five life.\r\n\r\nBah! With the lack of tables and losses, I tell DJ to drop me from the tournament as we report the result. I figured it wasn't worth it. But then I remembered a guy I was trading with would arrive around 6 PM, and it was only 3:30 (yes, it was 3:30 and we were still in round 2), so I took it back and went in for some more punishment.\r\n\r\nRound 3: 2-0 win vs B/W Runed Halo deck.\r\n\r\nWith the lack of tables we're forced to play at the nearby Dim Sum place (luckily they didn't chase us away). The kid is a nice guy, but he's playing in his first tournament and he learned Magic barely three weeks ago. He has nice cards though -- his deck had Rune Halos, Archons of Justice, Hallowed Burial, Oona. Unfortunately, he had too many do-nothings -- first time I've ever seen\r\n   \r\nGoldenglow Moth\r\n   \r\nand\r\n   \r\nGreater Auramancy\r\n   \r\nin a constructed deck (I know you need to click the links -- I doubt you know what those cards are!).\r\n\r\nI crush him without any opposition. I give him some friendly words of advice, although I'm not sure how he felt taking them from someone who was 0-2.\r\n\r\nRound 4 vs Faeries: 2-1 win.\r\n\r\nI get Bitterblossom advantage in game two. In game three, I won the race by tapping him down with Cryptic Command.\r\n\r\nRound 5 vs Demigod: 2-1 win\r\n\r\nNot your usual Demigod deck, as he has random Creakwood Lieges and Bitterblossoms. But I saw the Demigod in game one, so Crib Swaps were boarded in.\r\n\r\nI won game one. In game two I saw a hand with two lands, two Silvergill Adepts and a Banneret and I figured it was good. Except when I played my first land I realized I had kept a Mutavault and a Sunken Ruins. I couldn't cast anything before he killed me. I came back in game three and won without taking any damage.\r\n\r\nAt this point, I'm feeling a streak, thinking maybe I can still win 3 more in a row to hit 6-2. This is a lie; at every point in the tournament I'm thinking I can win all the remaining ones. I just mentioned it here because obviously I would be disappointed.\r\n\r\nRound 6 vs QnT: 0-2 loss\r\n\r\nIn game one, I was at 10 life and he was at 14, and I figured a 2nd Bitterblossom would close the gap so I risked it. On his turn, he hit me with Profane Command for 4, bringing back Kitchen Finks, giving me 3 turns to live and 16 points to chase. I try to Cryptic Command my own Bitterblossom on the fatal turn, but he showed me his own command and would have none of it.\r\n\r\nIn game two I'm stuck on two lands, with Dousings, Adepts and a Banneret in my hand, but I have colored mana this time. I play the Adepts first, hoping to draw into lands. I don't draw anymore and am forced to play the Banneret, which gets wiped away in a Firespout. In hindsight, since my hand had 2 Dousings (and I drew the 3rd one shortly after), I should have led with Adept, then Banneret, giving me 3 power on board and 3 turns of countermagic available. He was stuck at four lands all game, so that play might have been enough. Since I didn't do it, he managed to play a Chameleon Colossus which takes me down for 20.\r\n\r\nI've had enough, I'm out.\r\n\r\nFinal record: 3-3 matches, 7-8 games.\r\n\r\nIt's too much. I can't play this deck at the Grand Prix. The wins are too marginal, and the Kithkin matchup is too much of a tossup. I need to think about how I'm going to modify it (or what deck to audible into)\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Goldenglow Moth\r",

I figured I'd try out the Bluetooth with the laptop.\r\n\r\nAfter around 30 minutes of struggling with the unintuitiveness and some helpful googling I finally was able to transfer my file using the ff steps, for future reference:\r\n\r\nTurn on Bluetooth on the Acer Aspire using the Bluetooth button.\r\n\r\nRight-click the Bluetooth icon on the systray - Show Bluetooth Devices - Options - tick \"Allow Bluetooth devices to find this computer\"\r\n\r\nEnable Bluetooth on the N73 via menu - Tools - Bluetooth\r\n\r\nScroll right on the N73 and the Paired Device screen is shown. Choose Options - New Paired Device\r\n\r\nThe N73 should list your computer name (mine is PANDA!), select the computer name and you'll be prompted for a passkey. Don't input anything yet... \r\n\r\nBack to the Vista PC, right-click the Bluetooth icon in the systray, then choose Add Device.\r\n\r\nTick \"My device is set up and ready to be found.\" and click Next.\r\n\r\nThe wizard should list your phone. Choose the phone and click Next.\r\n\r\nTick \"Let me choose my own passkey\", and type a passkey.\r\n\r\n10. You get the message to \"Please enter the passkey on your Bluetooth device now\", so do just that.\r\n\r\n11. The bluetooth connection should be all set up, to send a file to your N73, right-click the bluetooth icon and click Send a file\r\n\r\n12. You're done. Hooray!\r\n\r\n_\r\n  \r\nSide note: After step 10, Vista seems to want to install drivers for the N73... but it doesn't seem to be necessary\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n\r\ndiv class=\"flockcredit\" style=\"text-align: right; color: #ccc; font-size: x-small;\"\r\n  Blogged with thebr / a style=\"color: #999; font-weight: bold;\" title=\"Flock Browser\" href=\"http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock\" target=\"_new\"br / Flock Browserbr / /a\r\n/div",

(A coworker of mine wisely advised me not to try using my work license at home.) So I looked around to see if there were any free (as in beer and as in speech) alternatives.\r\n\r\nThe one I found was FlashDevelop. Although the IDE looks Eclipse-like, it's actually built using .Net. While it's not yet 100% polished, my impression from about an hour of working with it is that it's reasonably mature and quite fast (speed is not exactly something you could claim was a strength of Adobe Flex Builder.)\r\n\r\nIt seems that it supports AS2 and Adobe AIR as well, but I wanted to try it out using Flex first. I needed to download and install the Flex SDK separately -- it builds your MXML files by invoking the Flex Compiler Shell. This means the \"Build automatically\" option isn't really practical here (although I'm not sure if Flex Builder does it differently) I probably need to download the Adobe AIR Runtime as well if I want to build AIR apps.\r\n\r\nI'm not gonna demo anything Flex-y yet (I only tried it out for an hour!), but this means I can start working on a particular thing which I've been thinking about for a while. Hopefully I can announce it soon, though methinks it'll be months before I get anything sensible ready.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flex\r",

While the Wizards official coverage gives you the play-by-play and the results, I’ll see if I can’t provide any interesting stories about my first constructed Grand Prix event.\r\n\r\n**\r\n  \r\nDay One Tournament Report\r\n  \r\n** \r\n\r\nAs mentioned in the previous post , I'm playing QnT and I hope to fight aggro decks all day long.\r\n\r\n**\r\n  \r\nRound 1.\r\n  \r\n** \r\n  \r\nI shuffle up with my first round opponent. I keep a two-lander with some good creature control spells. He starts with a Forest and I realize he'splaying some sort of monogreen elves deck. Unfortunately, it was a bad keep for me and my hand never got past the 2 lands. My notes show I never dealt a single point of damage in this game.\r\n\r\nI board in Sowers and Austere Commands. For game two, the tides are reversed, as I gain two life off a Kitchen Finks and never change my life total after that. An early Wren's Run Packmaster that got Sower'ed basically won me the game.\r\n\r\nFor game three, we didn't have much time, with barely 15 minutes left in the clock. However, my opponent had to mulligan to four cards, so we started with twelve minutes left on the clock. Not enough time for the control deck to win normally, I instead went aggro with Finks. I sowered the first creature he played -- a Wren's Run Vanquisher, planning to aggro with it. Unfortunately, the very next turn he managed to play out a second Vanquisher AND a Packmaster, following up later turns with two consecutive Colossus, making it difficult to advance on the ground. I had managed to bring him to 3 life by this point, but then he slowly started climbing up in life via Sapseep Forest. We hit time and it was clear neither of us could win in the five extra turns.\r\n\r\nI was a bit frustrated at this point since I was wondering whether he took too long in mulliganning, but I realized three minutes for three mulligans seemed reasonable. On the fifth turn I offered \"Would you like to concede?\" but neither of us would give way so my first round ended in a draw. I was well in control of the game and would have won easily if we only had ten or fifteen more minutes.\r\n\r\nThis was one thing I had not planned -- I would be hitting extra time more often than not; I needed to learn to play faster.\r\n\r\nMatch Record: 0-0-1\r\n\r\nGame Record: 1-1-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n  \r\nRound 2.\r\n  \r\n** \r\n  \r\nHe led with Silvergill Adept and mostly islands, so I figured I was up against traditional UW merfolk. Unfortunately not! His deck had loads of card advantage: Silvergill Adept, Wistful Selkie, Sage's Dousing, Familiar's Ruse (to reset the Adepts and Selkie!) which made it difficult for me to keep pace with mass removal. He also had the usual Reejerey and Mirror Entity. But the biggest problem for me had to be the Inkfathom Infiltrators, who needed a Firespout to be killed (could not be Shriekmawed!) I eventually lost game three to a pair of Infiltrators that I was unable to answer.\r\n\r\nMatch record: 0-1-1\r\n\r\nGame record: 2-3-1\r\n\r\nObviously not a very good start. However, it could only get better, right? (Famous last words)\r\n\r\n**\r\n  \r\nRound 3.\r\n  \r\n** \r\n  \r\nThis one was traditional UW merfolk. I lost game one to an aggro rush, making a mistake of walking a Cryptic Command into a Cursecatcher (curses, haven't fought against those in a while!) In game two I managed to take control and win the game. In game three, I had a nice hand: 3 lands and four relevant spells (Firepout, Cryptic Command x2, Kitchen FInks). However, all 3 lands were filter lands! I figured it was okay...  i had two draws to get there, and drawing any other non-filter lands would get me running. Of course, it turned out to be a bad keep, and I never went beyond those 3 lands.\r\n\r\nMatch record: 0-2-1\r\n\r\nGame record: 3-5-1\r\n\r\nAt this point I was thinking of dropping since I knew an X-2-1 record wouldn't make it in, given the high attendance. My opponent seemed to think otherwise, so I decided to proceed. (She later turned out to be wrong)\r\n\r\n**\r\n  \r\nRound 4.\r\n  \r\n** \r\n  \r\nI was facing a ramp-style Doran deck, with Fertile Grounds to accelerate into fatties such as Chameleon Colossus and Cloudthresher. I won game three off playing three Runed Halos (two of them for Chameleon Colossus), and my opponent complained about how he'd been Runed Halo'ed all day.\r\n\r\nYes, I finally won!\r\n\r\nMatch record: 1-2-1\r\n\r\nGame record: 5-6-1\r\n\r\n**\r\n  \r\nRound 5.\r\n  \r\n** \r\n  \r\nHe starts out with a Plains and a Stalwart, and I know the enemy. My chances are good as long as he doesn't have that 1-2-3 punch autopilot draw. Oh wait, yes he did -- almost. I stayed alive but had to use up my Shriekmaw to take out a Wizened Cenn, which meant I was helpless against the Burrenton Forge-Tender and Spectral Procession that followed. He got an even more insane draw on the next game; I could only remember that I was unable to fight back.\r\n\r\nMatch record: 1-3-1\r\n\r\nGame record: 5-8-1\r\n\r\nAt this point I was tired of losing and decided to drop. I remember ticking drop on my result slip, but based on the play history at the DCI webapp, I actually got a match loss for the next round. Huh. Oh well, I don't feel like contesting it -- I'm sure the guy appreciated the free DCI rating points (I lost about 20-30 in that one)\r\n\r\nSo, my Grand Prix was over -- I spent the rest of the day watching my teammates play and watching feature matches. It was great seeing Levy, Saito, Shuhei, etc. in action. The Japanese especially, they make their moves quickly, never hesitating, it's amazing. We also got some Chameleon Colossuses and Makeshift Mannequins signed by the artist Darrel Riche.\r\n\r\n**\r\n  \r\nBonus Tournament Report: Switch playing 5-color Elementals\r\n  \r\n** \r\n\r\naddress\r\n  The following section is unedited from a Yahoo Messenger conversation!\r\n/address\r\n\r\n (20:45:21) switch_nftzu: round 1: RDW (with deuses of calamity instead of demigods) 1-2. apparently, this guy went 3-0\r\n  \r\n (20:45:31) switch_nftzu: round 2: QnT 1-2\r\n  \r\n (20:45:40) switch_nftzu: round 3: faeries 2-0\r\n  \r\n (20:45:59) switch_nftzu: round 4: mana acc/landie: 2-1\r\n  \r\n (20:46:40) switch_nftzu: round 5: doran (though i didn't know until the last turn, where he played a treefolk harbinger, and i noticed one too many draws) 2-0\r\n  \r\n (20:47:27) switch_nftzu: round 6: doran 2-0\r\n  \r\n (20:48:28) switch_nftzu: round 7: RDW 2-1\r\n  \r\n (20:48:40) switch_nftzu: round 8: cairn wanderer 0-2\r\n \r\n (20:56:21) switch_nftzu: round 1: lost in extra turns to a topdecked redcap when i was down to 2: was playing for the draw\r\n  \r\n (20:56:32) switch_nftzu: round 2: death by oona\r\n  \r\n (20:49:35) switch_nftzu: wins: rd 3: guy didn't know how to play the deck (e.g. snakeform on colossus before declaring attacks)\r\n  \r\n (20:50:19) switch_nftzu: rd 4: win game one, beat down by oversoul & colossus, mull to 5, kill turn 2 and turn 3 devoted druids, he gets stuck on 3 lands long enough for me to bash\r\n  \r\n (20:51:11) switch_nftzu: rd 5: he had no plays game 1 except for austere command, he mulls to 6 on game two, has 2 lands and 6 cards in hand by turn 2: game loss\r\n  \r\n (20:52:55) switch_nftzu: rd 6: round after riche signs colossi, they immediately pay dividends by stomping in game 1. game 2 he gets down runed halo on gouger and horde, i get him down to 2 white vivids and 1 black vivid, all with no counters with fulminator mages for a few turns, eventually bash with 8/8 colossus\r\n  \r\n switch_nftzu: i think he faerie macabres the two fulminator mages in the grave\r\n  \r\n (20:55:42) switch_nftzu: rd 7: i suppose colossus wins me game 1, last life standings were 11-12 against me. i flag a bit (2 land, smokebraider hand against a deck with spout) and get chomped by demigod. round three: harbinger for smokebraider, smokebraider. he thoughtseizes and chooses colossus over fulminator. i kill his vivid, harbinger for fulminator, kill his next vivid, leaving him with a filterland for maybe 6 turns where i case another smokebraider, mulldrifter and eventually lark to fetch the fulminators to kill his only land and have a fulminator in play\r\n  \r\n (20:55:49) switch_nftzu: you saw my death in round 8\r\n\r\nIndeed, I did see him die in the final round -- to a 4/4 Protection from Black, red and white, protection from converted mana cost 3 or greater, first strike, lifelink, vigilance monster. Of course, it was some guy from HK playing with a deck that had\r\n  \r\nMistmeadow Skulk\r\n  \r\nand\r\n  \r\nCairn Wanderer\r\n  \r\n! It was quite awesome to behold, and the HK guy was quite ecstatic to win.\r\n\r\nSwitch finished with a 5-3 record.\r\n\r\nAlex unfortunately, dropped out at the same round I did, finishing with a 1-4 record.\r\n\r\nPaul was still playing with a long shot of making the top 64. We found him battling a Caucasian guy in a Kithkin mirror match. He was well ahead -- having something like eight creatures to his opponents two, and didn't even bother taking down the opposing Ajani Goldmane instead going straight for the head. After he won the match, his opponent commented that he should have spared two Spirit tokens to take out Ajani, given how comfortably ahead he was -- an untimely Spectral Procession might have turned the game around.\r\n\r\nPaul just shrugged, enjoying his 6-2 finish. (What a lucksack! :p) Unfortunately, this was only good enough for a 90+ finish, not enough for him to make day two.\r\n\r\nOverall Team Snafubar match record: 13-12-1. Alex and I brought the average down, but I think we still had fun playing. This was easily my worst constructed weekend so far, and I would definitely lose somewhere around a hundred points of Constructed rating, but it wasn't so bad.\r\n\r\nWe left the mall and decided to crash at a friend's place. Sometime around 1 AM, I decided to come back the next day to PTQ with Kithkin. I wouldn't have much sleep, but what the hell -- I planned on a 3-day Magic weekend, so I might as well go on with it!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpman08/welcome\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/magic/2008/09/grand-prix-manila-grinders-and-day-one-decks/\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Mistmeadow Skulk\r",

The opponent was a guy from HK; luckily I'm pretty used to talking with HK-accented people, so we had almost no communication trouble at all. The only time I couldn't understand him was when he tried to bounce something using Cryptic Command, I had no idea what the phrase he was using for bouncing was! I made a misplay in game two by playing a Spectral Procession from my hand instead of from under Windbrisk Heights when it was available. I also had a sideboarding problem where I didn't think he would have Stillmoon Cavaliers (and hence had no Moonglove Extract). Those same cavaliers helped him stabilize at 3 life to take game two.\r\n\r\nRound 2 vs Demigod DW: 2-1 win. My opponent didn't board out Ashenmoor Gougers, which are so bad in this format. He was stuck on three lands for game three, and I had a Forge-Tender on the board to stop Spout, and he couldn't cast the Soul Snuffers.\r\n\r\nRound 3 vs Unknown Deck (I have something scribbled in my notes, but I couldn't read it!): 2-1 win.\r\n\r\nRound 4 vs Gbw No Doran: 0-2 loss. In game three, he had two Stillmoon Cavaliers that I didn't see at all in the first two games. Those guys went all the way.\r\n\r\nRound 5 vs Little Kid GW: 2-0 win. It was fun for the Stillmoon Cavalier to jump on block 5/6 flying indestructible vigilance guys. His two big guys on the board were no match to my seven + Mirrorweave in game one. In game two, apparently he boarded in Runed Halo, which are pretty bad vs Spectral Procession.\r\n\r\nRound 6 vs Doran the Explorer: 2-1 win. My opponent drew no Firespouts in game three; he really had no chance here.\r\n\r\nRound 7 vs Demigod DW: 2-0 win.\r\n\r\nTournament record: 5-2. I finished the PTQ in 14th place, good enough to win 4 booster packs. My prize rares were: Balefire Liege, Glamerdye, Ashling the Extinguisher, Scarecrone (Not so good)\r\n\r\nI watched the finals of the Grand Prix of course. The official coverage is okay, but it doesn't capture some of the unique FIlipino elements. Even though I was still playing in the PTQ during the quarters, we immediately knew that Luis Magisa had won his match since every Filipino in the crowd watching literally burst into cheers. Contrast to the lackluster clapping when Magisa lost to a Japanese Faerie player in the semis.\r\n\r\nDuring the awarding ceremony, the crowd was very rowdy, chanting \"Burger! Burger!\" when Luis Magisa accepted his giant check. (Bry would hate that.) The winner of the event, Sugaya pandered to the crowd as well, more than willing to pose for photos after accepting his giant check. (His get-up was ridiculous.)\r\n\r\nA lot of players were asking name players such as Tomoharu Saito or Raphael Levy to sign some cards for them; I'm not sure if it's good for us to treat them that way. They're Magic celebrities sure, but I don't think their signature adds anything to the cards. It's ok to look up to them for their gameplay or deck ideas or what not, but I don't think we should idolize them or anything -- they're still Magic players like the rest of us, except they're more willing to devote their time to the game.And someday, we're going to have to rise up and challenge their dominance of Magic in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n\r\nThat's all for GP Manila, hopefully we can have another big event in the Philippines soon. Props go out to the people at Neutral Grounds for organizing the event and being able to support 600+ people even though the DCI people were only expecting around 400+.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/eventcoverage/gpman08/welcome\r\n [2]: http://bryanbibat.blogspot.com/2008/09/on-cheeseburgers.html\r",

While the Wizards official coverage gives you the play-by-play and the results, I’ll see if I can’t provide any interesting stories about my first constructed Grand Prix event.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nGrand Prix Manila, Day Zero\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nI met up with Switch and Alex at the venue (Megatrade hall in SM Megamall) early and got in by 10 am. I had originally been planning to play the grinders with Kithkin; but since I was planning to play five-color control in the main event I figured I might as well get some practice in and hopefully get 3 byes.\r\n\r\nHowever, I was unable to assemble it in the morning; so I had somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 minutes to assemble it after signing up for the second trial. The mistake was that I didn’t have a 5-color control decklist to reference, and I built it with only 25 lands. We had to buy Runed Halos from the dealers (they were a bit cheap)\r\n\r\nThe 25 land count would come back to haunt me, as I kept a two-land hand in the first round of the first trial and never recovered. I believe my opponent then was from South Korea and was playing Doran. I quickly lost and was thus eliminated from the trial.\r\n\r\nStubbornly, I thought it was only bad luck and went in for another trial. In round one I faced a Kithkin player from Singapore. I was able to keep him under control and win in two games. In round two I faced Elementals, a pretty bad matchup for 5-color control in general, but even worse when I only had 25 lands! Two Fulminator mages sealed game one for him, and in game two I managed to get myself hit by Mind Shatter for 5! Obviously I quickly lost and was dropped from the trial.\r\n\r\n_\r\n    \r\n\"Ang brutal naman ng trials!\" –Alex\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n\r\nAlex gave it a try as well, playing Kithkin, but lost in round one of his trial as well.\r\n\r\nSwitch on the other hand, had decided to give limited a try, playing sealed deck in the Super FNM tournament. He only managed a 1-2 record before dropping; at least he had a card pool with a Reflecting Pool!\r\n\r\nWe spent the rest of the day watching grinders, trading and building a deck for Switch. We had decided to assemble an elementals build for him and the Reflecting Pool he got from the Super FNM would help.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, more than 480 players had signed up for the Grand Prix. The turnout would be larger than expected.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nGrand Prix Manila, Day One\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nSwitch, Alex and I again made it to the venue early. Paul made it just before they closed off registration.

On the Monday before the Grand Prix, the only decks we were sure to be playing (and had already been assembled) were Paul’s Kithkin and Alex’s Necroskitter deck. I proposed the following plan: For the grinders on Friday, I would play the Kithkin deck, and we would assemble Switch’s deck on that same day. For the GP proper, I would assemble a five-color control deck similar to Gerry Thompson’s GP-winning decklist.\r\n  /p\r\n  \r\n  p\r\n  /p\r\n  \r\n  p style=\"margin-bottom: 0in;\"\r\n    Next: The Grinders\r\n  /p",

My father claims it's his favorite movie of all time; high praise considering he watches every movie that comes out EVER. I'm not actually going to talk about the movie; it's awesome, if you haven't seen it, you should. You're missing half your life.\r\n\r\nIf you had one day of eternity, what would you do?\r\n\r\nToo bad it's not possible to train to be Batman (your body gets reset every morning); you need to focus on mastering mental disciplines first. Ideally you would have an internet connection available; it should take a few man-years or so to memorize Wikipedia. Probably at some point I would test the limits of what a human being could accomplish in the span of 24 hours. Is it possible to take over the world in 24 hours? Since you get infinite repeats, maybe.\r\n\r\nI wonder if a remake of Groundhog Day would sell in this day and age.\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"flockcredit\" style=\"text-align: right; color: #ccc; font-size: x-small;\"\r\n  Blogged with thebr / a style=\"color: #999; font-weight: bold;\" title=\"Flock Browser\" href=\"http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock\" target=\"_new\"br / Flock Browserbr / /a\r\n/div",

I generally don't know how to play the mirror match.\r\n\r\nRound 3 vs 5-color control: 1-2 loss. His build was too strong against Kithkin; in addition to Firespouts and Hallowed Burials, he also had Soul Snuffers.\r\n\r\nDrop. Tournament record: 1-2-drop. This turned out to be a mistake, as I found out the following week that X-2 might have had a chance of winning prerelease passes.\r\n\r\nSep 14 Pre-Alara Triple Treat (Prerelease passes at stake)\r\n\r\nI changed the sideboard, taking out the janky Pollen Lullabies and putting in 3 Knight of Meadowgrain to improve my creature battles in the mirror. I also went with +3 Kinsbaile Borderguard, -2 Order of Whiteclay, -1 Crib Swap to better fight mass removal.\r\n\r\nRound 1 vs Kithkin (mirror match): 2-1 win. I basically just overloaded with Spectrals and Cloudgoats to take game 3.\r\n\r\nRound 2 vs Faeries: 2-0 win. My opponent had what he called \"the three-land curse\" in game two and hardly put up a fight.\r\n\r\nRound 3 vs Unknown deck (no notes): 2-0 win. I'll update this if I figure it out.\r\n\r\nRound 4 vs Switch with 5-color control (Quick and Toast): 2-1 win. Switch and I seem to play each other often if we're in the same tournament. He won our practice games earlier, but this time I was serious :p\r\n\r\nRound 5 vs Monogreen splashing red (Firespout) and black (Thoughtseize, Profane Command): 2-0 win.\r\n\r\nRound 6 vs Faeries: 0-2 loss. I kept subpar hands both games. My opponent told me I should be boarding out the Cloudgoat Rangers. Is this true?\r\n\r\nRound 7 vs Monoblack: 2-0 win. My opponent is a regular player and we often meet at tournaments, and I've borrowed cards from him in the past. One time we happened to be riding the same jeepney together, and he treated me to the jeepney fare, but jokingly said I should give him the win next time we meet in a tournament and I begged off of course. Lolz, lucky.\r\n\r\nTournament result: 5-2, enough for sixth place and a prerelease pass! Free Ajani Vengeant!\r\n\r\nThis is the end for Lorwyn block constructed!",

I opened two Mythic Rares which was obviously above average. As a side note, I don't know about the secondary market effect but when opening boosters, Mythic Rares are absolutely a home run. You find yourself excited to open every Alara booster in hopes of ripping a Mythic!\r\n\r\nNo game blow-by-blow this time. I went 3 and 1, losing in round 2 to an Exalted deck. I severely underestimated this mechanic in Limited;\r\n   \r\nAngelic Benediction\r\n   \r\nis a pretty big problem for the opposing player.\r\n\r\nSo I failed to win a prerelease shirt again (somewhat awkward since I had made a forum post asking if we would have prerelease shirts larger than XL!)\r\n\r\nThe packs I won didn't have any good rares, so I convinced Switch that we should go play another flight (in hindsight it wasn't that good an idea!)\r\n\r\nMy second flight pool:\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"decklist\"\r\n  ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n  /ul\r\n  \r\n  ul

pool was significantly worse; I basically just put together all the removal I had and hoped I could control the board.\r\n\r\nI only went 2 and 2 this time though; I lost round one after my opponent hit the cycling off Resounding Thunder before I did. I lost round four in two games -- both to a resolved Realm Razer that left me defenseless.\r\n\r\nSo, 5-3 in eight rounds. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either.\r\n\r\nSlops to the venue at Eastwood. The playing area was in the open, it was humid and later in the night we had to play in the dark and with rain pouring on the tents.\r\n\r\nAnyway, Alara seems pretty good, especially in limited. The multicolor theme is always fun, and there's surprisingly a lot of color-fixing available for four or five color decks. However, we probably won't play at the release party, seeing as how we played the prerelease TWICE.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Angelic Benediction\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Benj on 2008-10-09 03:14:29 +0000\r\nNice blog you got here. Sana dumami pa ang mga pinoy MTG bloggers. 🙂\r\n\r\nQuestion: How do you make the decklists look like the way they do in yellow\r\n  \r\nboxes? Even the cardnames have links. Do you do that manually? I'm really\r\n  \r\ninterested in having the same thing for my own blog. 😉\r\n\r\nThanks in advance, and keep up the good work!\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2008-10-09 05:12:23 +0000\r\nHi Benj. I actually read your blog also, sana nga dumami tayo hehe.\r\n\r\nAbout the decklists and cardnames, I do programming so I wrote a plugin for\r\n  \r\nWordpress that automatically formats the decklists for me. Unfortunately since\r\n  \r\nyou're using Blogger, it's more difficult since Blogger doesn't support\r\n  \r\nplugins. It might be possible using JavaScript... I'll think about it hehe",

If you're getting an error like \"ImportError: cannot import name parse_lookup\", then you need to get the source code from SVN.\r\n\r\nAdding the tagging to the blog was pretty easy:\r\n\r\nAdd the tagging app to settings.py\r\n\r\nAdd a tagging.fields.TagField to the Post model\r\n\r\nAdd a \"tags\" text field to the post form used.\r\n\r\nModify templates to display the tags.\r\n\r\nI used something like \"/tag/\" url mapping to get all posts associated with a tag.

Our mom had said we'd like the movie and she still owed us one since it was her fault we watched Big Stan. So we're giving her a chance to redeem herself.\r\n\r\nThe spoilerless review:\r\n\r\nSince Eagle Eye trailers seem to be everywhere, you probably have some idea of at least the start of the story. Jerry Shaw is an ordinary loser working at Copy Cabana when he comes into seven hundred fifty thousand dollars and a whole lot of terrorist hardware in his apartment, facilitated by a mysterious woman who contacts him via his cellphone. The FBI bust his apartment and suddenly he's a fugitive on the run for reasons unknown to him.\r\n\r\nFor me, the gauge of how good an action movie is how difficult it is for me to see how it ends. For Eagle Eye, it started out a bit slow, then became action-packed without explanation then got to the middle where the plot was developed, and by that point I thought I had a pretty good handle of where it was going. Except I was wrong. And towards the end of the movie there were a few moments of \"Oh, so that's what it was for!\" which was a pretty good indication. There was a bit of a cop out at the ending, but I guess that they want this to be a \"feel-good\" action movie so whatever.\r\n\r\nIf you're not yet tired of Shia Lebouf and his half-dorky antics, the movie's not a bad way to waste a couple of hours.\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"flockcredit\" style=\"text-align: right; color: #ccc; font-size: x-small;\"\r\n  Blogged with thebr / a style=\"color: #999; font-weight: bold;\" title=\"Flock Browser\" href=\"http://www.flock.com/blogged-with-flock\" target=\"_new\"br / Flock Browserbr / /a\r\n/div",

/div\r\n/div\r\n\r\nThe exalted theme is pretty good and I was glad for a chance to try it out. I'm basically splashing red and black for Resounding Thunder, Broodmate Dragon and Infest. The dragon is rightly a bomb and won me every game where he resolved. The Infest was probably a mistake -- it's not good against everybody and most of the time it sits in my hand bewailing the lack of swamps. I often side it out for the second Guardians of Akrasa.\r\n\r\nI intentionally played a lower curve this time. Before I would have been using stuff like the Yoked Plowbeast, but I decided I wanted to be attacking on turns three and four instead of cycling, then finishing with fliers. A lot of players will build sealed decks like 5-color Naya decks with lots of fat monsters typically leaving them open during the early turns. Not that Naya is a bad strategy mind you, it's just that I seem to face Mosstodons, Cavern Thoctars and Ridge Rannets all the time.\r\n\r\nTournament report follows, highlights only.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 1:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n2-1 win\r\n\r\nI lost game two to a resolved\r\n   \r\nRealm Razer\r\n   \r\n, a card which I grossly underestimated before, not playing it in my prerelease pool. It's basically Armageddon + body; as soon as you have any sort of creature advantage you just play it out. I actually boarded in the 3rd obelisk for game 3 to make it easier to recover from his bomb. I also played aggressively with both creatures and removal so that he neved had a creature advantage. At the end of the game, he did have the Realm Razer in hand but couldn't play it because he was behind by around 4 creatures to one.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 2:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n2-0 win\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 3:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n2-0 win\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 4 vs JT Porter.\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nI don't normally name-drop here, mostly because I'm never sure if any of the guys I name would mind. Porter is a former National champ, GP winner and a well-known Magic player in the community so he\r\n   \r\n_\r\n    \r\nprobably\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n   \r\nwon't mind\r\n\r\nAnyway, yeah it was Porter, so I figured I had to hit my A-game. And not make any bad plays\r\n   \r\n_\r\n    \r\n(what was the subtitle of this blog again?)\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n   \r\nLet's skip game one where I was stuck with my only 3 blue cards and Infest in hand while having only Plains, a Forest and a Swamp.  Skip game two as well, I just came out fast and aggro'ed early.\r\n\r\nIt was late in game three and I had stabilized at eight life. Porter had a Cavern Thoctar and the blue exalted archer out. I was swinging back with Stoic Angel backed by Guardians of Akrasa. I played Sigiled Paladin and swung, then passed the turn, leaving him at 15 life (he had previously gained a buttload due to\r\n   \r\nRhox War Monk\r\n   \r\n).\r\n\r\nOn his turn, he swings with the Cavern Thoctar, which is a printed 5/5. I look at the Resounding Thunder in my hand and figure first strike damage off the Sigiled Paladin + 3 from the burn spell was good. It wasn't, since I forgot about the exalted guy making the Thoctar a 6/6. I facepalmed myself and Porter gave me a casual \"Ok lang yan Roy!\" I figured I had lost the game right there, but we don't give up 'til the fighting's done, so I kept going. Who knows, even a former National Champ can make a mistake!\r\n\r\nI ripped the topdeck and saw a Grixis obelisk. I swung with the Angel for four, bringing him to 11. Then I play the Obelisk, and now having a black source I manage to play the last card in my hand -- Broodmate Dragon! I take a\r\n   \r\nPestermite\r\n   \r\nthat someone had left on the table and flipped it over to pretend it was a 4/4 flier and I saw Porter got a bit more serious. I passed the turn. Porter swung with his Thoctar, and this time the Guardians of Akrasa sacrificed themselves for the cause.\r\n\r\nPorter passed back the turn with around eleven mana up and a fistful of cards. Now that I think about it, it was an obvious tell, but at that time I just saw that I had eleven power worth of fliers and he was at eleven life, so I willfully sent my Stoic Angel and the 2 Dragons in the red zone and Porter obliged by cycling the Resounding Silence. The angel and the parent dragon left the game, leaving the token to bring Porter down to seven. I play a Court Archers, ready to chump-block the Thoctar to keep me alive.\r\n\r\nPorter draws his card and counts his mana. He shows me Resounding Wave, bouncing the Court Archers, then swings with the Cavern Thoctar, pumping it twice to make it lethal eight damage. I grinned, of course even the best players can make mistakes! My Druid of the Anima sneaks out from the lands she had been hiding from and willingly sacrificed herself to the Thoctar. I would have been dead if Porter had noticed her and cycled the Resounding Wave instead.\r\n\r\nOn my turn I swing with the Dragon again and bring Porter down to 3. Then I re-play the Court Archer (yeah, slight misplay now that I see it) and pass the turn. Porter draws his card and tells me that \"naawa yung deck ko sakin\". He plays Bull Cerodon and swings with two 5/5s. The Archers chump the Thoctar and I drop to 3 life. Then he plays what he topdecked -- Court Archers to block the Broodmate Dragon!\r\n\r\nI had no cards in hand and was dead on the board. I had already used the Resounding Thunder and the Oblivion Ring so my only possible out had to be on top of deck in order for me to win. I flipped the top card unto the table -- and showed him the Bant Charm! \"Archers to bottom of library,\" I said and the dragon token took the win!\r\n\r\n2-1 win. Remember, even if you're playing against very good players, never give up 'til the fighting's done!\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 5:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n2-0 win.\r\n\r\nMy opponent had to mulligan to five both games, so it never really became dangerous on my end. Winning this round meant I could draw into the top eight! Huzzah!\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 6: ID\r\n   \r\n** \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 7: ID\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nThe top eight was booster draft of course. Unfortunately, this was my first time drafting the format and had not yet read up on it before, so I had no idea what to do. I took the rare from my first pack (\r\n   \r\nCruel Ultimatum\r\n   \r\n) and just settled into Grixis.\r\n\r\nHere's my top 8 draft deck:\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"decklist\"\r\n  ul

on the right, so I think I got a pretty mediocre draft. Cruel Ultimatum was pretty much my only bomb.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nQuarterfinals vs Naya\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n:\r\n\r\nGame one he managed to bring in an early Realm Razer, but I actually had a slight creature advantage so we stalled and rebuilt lands. Finally, with one card in hand he swung with the Realm Razer giving me a chance to kill it and bring back our lands. Obviously he wanted those lands back for a reason, and he was ahead in number of creatures so I figured he must have a Titanic Ultimatum in hand. Unluckily for him, I already had the Cruel Ultimatum in hand and he just gave me back the lands to cast it! There's practically no way to recover from my Ultimatum resolving so we went into game two.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I lost both games two and three and in both cases it came down to me not having the third swamp to cast Cruel Ultimatum. I lost game two when he Realm Razer'ed with a creature advantage. In game three I was racing him with an Onyx Goblet of all things, and I had the cancel for the Realm Razer, but he managed to hit his Titanic Ultimatum mana the turn before I would've taken it out of his hand with Cruel Ultimatum (the last swamp was on top of my library!)\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nFinal Record: 5-1-2 (matches)\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n,\r\n   \r\n**\r\n    \r\n11-4 (games)\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n, finishing in the top eight and winning six packs. The rares from the prize packs were:\r\n   \r\nFeral Hydra\r\n   \r\n,\r\n   \r\nQuietus Spike\r\n   \r\n,\r\n   \r\nGoblin Assault\r\n   \r\n,\r\n   \r\nTitanic Ultimatum\r\n   \r\n,\r\n   \r\nCaldera Hellion\r\n   \r\nand\r\n   \r\nHell's Thunder\r\n   \r\n.\r\n\r\nOverall, a pretty good day for me... I think the last time I ever went undefeated in Swiss was somewhere around Time Spiral block constructed. If I had managed to win the trial and get the 3 byes I would have seriously considered splurging the cash to go Taipei, but after reading in the forums that the visa requirements are a bit of a hassle (and I wouldn't be able to get a promo price for the ticket anymore), I'm not so sure anymore. Let's see how I do in succeeding trials... \r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Realm Razer\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rhox War Monk\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Pestermite\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Cruel Ultimatum\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Feral Hydra\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Quietus Spike\r\n [7]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Goblin Assault\r\n [8]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Titanic Ultimatum\r\n [9]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Caldera Hellion\r",

I focused too much on the Exalted deck and streamlined into two colors with a splash into red. Since my pool was a bit mediocre (no real bombs), I should've been greedier and went for multiple splashes. And not playing Executioner's Capsule and Sanctum Gargoyle maindeck? No excuse for that really. I think I play better on Saturdays.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 1\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\n: Lost this one in 3 games to a Sharding Sphinx. Embarassing, since it was the guy's first time to play Shards of Alara. I had a bad sequence where I had Cavern Thoctar and Jungle Weaver in my hand; I played the Weaver first, then next turn attacked with the Weaver and played the Thoctar. At that point he already had some small fliers available so really I should've just either kept the Weaver behind to block or played the Thoctar first (so that the Weaver could block next turn). I was very close to winning -- if I had only managed to have a blocker for the Sharding Sphinx one turn earlier.\r\n\r\n1-2 games, 0-1 rounds. It's usually not good for me if I lose round one.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 2:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nMy opponent has the Sphinx Sovereign, but I keep drawing answers. I win in two.\r\n\r\n3-2 games, 1-1 rounds.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 3:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nI saw this guy's deck on the same table in round one and it was kind of sick. War Monk, Bant Charm, Stoic Angel, Rafiq of the Many... practically a Bant precon. I managed to win game one though.\r\n\r\nIn game two, we stalled on the ground and he was killing me wih the Exalted Aven. After that game I realized that I had both Quietus Spike and Vithian Stinger in play. I called over a judge and asked \"Does Deathtouch trigger on non-combat damage?\" The answer was of course yes and of course I facepalmed. I could have wiped his whole board with that combo!\r\n\r\nI kept a hand with four land and two spells in game three, but didn't get much action then lost the game.\r\n\r\n4-4 games, 1-2 rounds. I actually ticked \"Drop\" on the match result slip, planning to leave. Later I changed my mind, since top sixteen could still win me a few packs, and I went over to the judge table to get myself undropped.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 4:\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\nWell, I don't remember much of this match. My deck was faster than his, but he had more fatties. I tried to make winning push in game 3 using the Quietus Spike, but he pulled out an Oblivion Ring in time to get rid of it, then stabilized and I lost from there.\r\n\r\n5-6 games, 1-3 rounds. I should've dropped the first time, so now I drop for sure!\r\n\r\nThat didn't go so well. Next time I shouldn't build my sealed deck quite so quickly. I should have taken the time to see if there were any possible alternative builds.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I won't be able to attend the next trial on 25-October, so my next tournament will be the last Neutral Grounds GPT on November 2.",

The rates at PAL were better, so we decided to book using their website. I did the search for the flights, booked the seats, input my uncle's details, etc. When we got to the screen to input the credit card info, my dad went to call my uncle to confirm and to get his credit card. He can't have been gone five minutes. When he came back, I enter the credit card info in the form, click submit... and I get a session timeout error.\r\n\r\nWow. Their session timeout value is somewhere between five to ten minutes, closer to five. I'm not sure if this is reasonable, especially given that their website isn't that user-friendly to begin with and you may spend some time poring through the flight lists to get one that you want.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I figure the credit card hasn't been charged yet since I timed out while entering the CC details, so I go to try again. Search for the flight... wait, the one with the cheap rate was no longer available!\r\n\r\nI figure that while I was selecting dates the first time through their Online Booking application, the backend marked the last seat on that flight as \"Reserved\" under my uncle's name, but since I timed out before I could pay that seat may now be lost forever.\r\n\r\nI figure they probably have some sort of cleanup if the booking hasn't been confirmed (i.e. paid for), so I leave the website for a bit then come back later. I search again, and the cheap flight is there! I get my dad's credit card and proceed to go through the steps again. I get to the credit card form and input the details and click submit. Yay, it's verifying! Checking the status bar though, it seems to be verifying against a MasterCard URL... but the card I used was a Visa!I was in such a hurry I forgot to tick MasterCard.\r\n\r\nUnbelievably, the credit card verification was being done from my machine (since I could see the mastercard URL in the browser status bar), instead of on the server where it could be done more reliably.\r\n\r\nOkay, this time it was my fault. No sweat, I'll wait for the website to fail the verification then re-input the credit card details. So I wait. Then wait some more. The website is taking forever and not doing anything. Firefox prompts that the website tried to show a popup. I right-click and enable pop-ups for the website, nothing though. I wait some more.\r\n\r\nDamnit, I finally reload the page to find that \"my session has expired.\" Sure enough, I tried to search for the cheap flight and it was no longer available AGAIN.\r\n\r\nI give up. I'm not going to try again. Seriously this time. I'll give the credit card back to my dad and just tell him to book manually (and to double check that the card has not been charged.)\r\n\r\nI always have a bad time with Airline websites -- I hate the Cebu Pacific one as well. These companies need to get better web developers.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by noems on 2008-10-22 18:57:35 +0000\r\nayy nako. i'm hating the cebu pacific site right now.\r\n\r\ni spent almost the whole afternoon booking and reloading pages. i haven't\r\n  \r\npassed the flight selection yet!\r\n\r\nWith the heavy traffic of Users specially with their frequent promos, they\r\n  \r\nreally should improve the website.\r\n\r\nIf you can't serve it, don't sell it.",

Last night I worked on a WordPress importer, so that I could migrate posts from my current blog(s) into the Django-powered blog that I'm coding. I'm using BeautifulSoup to parse the WordPress export file and insert them as Django objects.\r\n\r\nSince I was running the script repeatedly, I had to figure out how to easily run it from the command line, without having to run it from inside manage.py shell. After some searching, I found that what I needed to do was set an environment variable DJANGO\\SETTINGS\\FILE to point to my settings file. After that, the importer script could be run repeatedly.\r\n\r\nAlso made a few tweaks to my dev copy:\r\n\r\n  Modified URL mapping to follow the permalinks of the old blog (so that people linking to me don't suddenly have broken links)\r\n  Added a tag cloud (Still using django-tagging)\r\n  Added markdown support to the admin maintenance screen. I used to think I would need to code my own form for posting, but I think I can live with just using the admin-provided one (initially at least)\r\n\r\nI plan to migrate my main blog over once I take my Christmas break (hopefully 2nd week of December)\r\n\r\nStuff to do:\r\n\r\n  Use clean, non-hardcoded urls (url template tag and reverse())\r\n  Customize the admin screen for posting\r\n  Clean up the layout and templates",

I don't have a draft cap or anything. I went drafting with our would-be GP Taipei contingent last November 12 (Wednesday). I actually almost never play sanctioned matches outside of the weekend tournaments, but I was a bit tired from work and wanted to blow off steam, so I went ahead to Robinson's Galleria and waited a couple of hours for the 8-man draft to fill up.\r\n\r\nI opened with Cruel Ultimatum as my first pick, then got a couple of white weenies (Akrasan Squire and Sigiled Paladin) before getting a 4th-pick Agony Warp. I grabbed some more blue and black fliers and felt myself going into Grixis again.\r\n\r\nSecond pack I opened Flameblast Dragon, Oblivion Ring, Branching Bolt, Soul's Fire, etc. I gazed longingly at the removal for a bit before tucking away my flying bomb rare. I got a Resounding Thunder later on and also rare-drafted Rafiq of the Many and Ad Nauseaum.\r\n\r\nHere's my draft deck:\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"decklist\"\r\n  ul

supercyclers.\r\n\r\nRound one game one, my opponent was Esper stuck with no islands, so I happily went Obelisk into 5-drop flier into Quietus Spike, winning quickly.\r\n\r\nRound one game two, I hit the correct combination of seven lands to play Cruel Ultimatum and there was no recovery from there.\r\n\r\nRound two game one, we were exchanging small blows. Eventually he was at 8 and I had Resounding Thunder in hand and the Obelisk of Bant in play so I only needed one more swing from any of my 3 fliers on the board to win the game. Unfortunately at this point he case Crater Hellion and I had stupidly failed to leave up black mana to regenerate my Sekeletal Kathari. I never recovered.\r\n\r\nRound two game two, mana screw. Nothing to see here, but obviously if I had been smart enough to leave regeneration mana open in game one I would have gotten the benefit of a third game.\r\n\r\nRound three game one, I bring him to two, but he stabilizes and clears my board and I don't draw burn to finish him off.\r\n\r\nRound three game two, I manage to go obelisk into five drop into quietus spike again, quickly taking him from 20 to 8 in one swing. I win the game and we go to the rubber match.\r\n\r\nI shuffle up and the TO hands us the pack that we're playing for. \"We should open it, so that if it's a crap rare we don't have to play the third game\", I joke around as I search for any useful sideboard cards.\r\n\r\nRound three game three he doesn't draw any creatures and I have a steady stream, so I keep the prize pack.\r\n\r\nIt turned out to contain a\r\n   \r\nMindlock Orb\r\n   \r\n, if we had opened it I might not have wanted to play the third game. :p My other prize pack had another Cruel Ultimatum, I think it's a set now!\r\n\r\nGood luck to the pinoy GP Taipei contingent!\r\n\r",

/div\r\n/div\r\n\r\nThe pool had decent removal, but no big game-winning bombs. I immediately went for red with the 2 Iguanars, and later was deciding between Naya or Jund. Eventually I just went four colors, Jund splashing white for removal. The deck was pretty decent and I figured I could hit 5-2 or even better if I got lucky. I kept wondering all day whether Manaplasm was any good and later someone pointed out I should have maindecked Topan Ascetic -- I keep underestimating that guy -- so I tried out swapping him for the Ooze, but couldn't get definite results to tell me the &#8216;plasm really sucked.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 1\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\ngame one comes down to a race between a 10/10 Rockslide Elemental and my own 13/13 Kresh the Bloodbraided. I had more chumpers, so I managed to win while still at six life. I won game two when he had a piss-poor draw.\r\n\r\n1-0 matches, 2-0 games\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 2\r\n   \r\n** \r\n   \r\ngame one my opponent had a Battlegrace Angel threatening to run away with the game, luckily I drew Resounding Silence off the top to save me. Game two he has the Battlegrace Angel\r\n   \r\n_\r\n    \r\nagain\r\n   \r\n_ \r\n   \r\nand I don't draw anything to stop it.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering whether this was the pool I registered, since the Angels kept coming out. Game three he had the Angel again, but I had removal. We went into topdeck mode, he was obviously hoping for the second angel, but I manage to finish him off before it comes out.\r\n\r\nAfter the game he confirms that it was in fact my pool. Lucky guy! At least I managed to eke out a win.\r\n\r\n2-0 matches, 4-1 games\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 3\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nIn the first game, he showed me 2 Courier's Capsule, 2 Executioner's Capsule, then finished me off with Cruel Ultimatum. It's my first time to be on the receiving end... that hurts! In the second game, he takes me out with Vein Drinker and Hell's Thunder. I look over his pool afterwards, it was pretty sick. I don't think I really had any chance of winning.\r\n\r\n2-1 matches, 4-3 games\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 4\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nI don't remember the details, but I do remember I made a misplay here when I thought Skeletonize would give me the token even if it didn't kill the target. Bad Magic player! RTFC!\r\n\r\n2-2 matches, 4-5 games\r\n\r\nAh, no more top eight for me. Anyway, I decide to keep playing. If anything, I need the practice.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 5\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nOpponent's deck had Exalted + Welkin Guide + Ooze Garden tricks to come out with big critters, but I managed to take the match in two games.\r\n\r\n3-2 matches, 6-5 games\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 6\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nI don't remember the details, but my notes show I didn't even deal any damage during the two games!\r\n\r\n3-3 matches, 6-7 games\r\n\r\nAt this point, there's no use in dropping, I go to try to win round seven and get a booster pack.\r\n\r\n**\r\n    \r\nRound 7\r\n   \r\n** \r\n\r\nI take game one by slowly grinding him down with Iguanar damage. I lose game two (I forget how). In game three my 16-land count catches up with me and I finally got manascrewed. I mulliganned a five-lander with no action (big mistake apparently) into a six-card, one land hand into a five-card, two-land hand that didn't give me the third land.\r\n\r\nFinal standing: 3-4 matches, 7-9 games.\r\n\r\nWell, at this point I can safely say I should have dropped after round four. I could have spent that time playing Fallout 3! Hopefully I can do better on the next PTQ.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, it seems I'm getting more blog readers, as more people are mentioning it at tournaments. To my faithful readers: feel free to post comments and tell me how I can improve my game! It would be much obliged!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Battlegrace Angel\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Tezzeret the Seeker\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by ogie on 2008-11-24 17:42:30 +0000\r\nI kept wondering all day whether Manaplasm was any good and later someone\r\n  \r\npointed out I should have maindecked Topan Ascetic -- I keep underestimating\r\n  \r\nthat guy -- so I tried out swapping him for the Ooze, but couldn’t get definite\r\n  \r\nresults to tell me the ‘plasm really sucked.\r\n\r\nyou play both 🙂\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2008-11-24 23:20:42 +0000\r\nWhat should I have cut?\r\n\r\n Comment by Daniel on 2008-11-25 19:06:59 +0000\r\nI think you should cut white. You already have a lot of removal so you don't\r\n  \r\nreally need to play Oblivion Ring since it just makes you have to play a\r\n  \r\nfourth basic land type. Plus you left out some really good on-color stuff for\r\n  \r\nthose white removal spells, like Topan Ascetic, and less so but still solid\r\n  \r\n2nd Carrion Thrash and Resounding Roar. You could cut one or two of the gold\r\n  \r\n2-drops since it seems like (haven't layed out the deck myself) you're pretty\r\n  \r\nspread among BRG, and you have a decent amount of removal to deal with a rush.\r\n\r\nYou can always board it in if you think you're playing a deck you absolutely\r\n  \r\ncan't beat without it.\r\n\r\nAnd Manaplasm is really freaking good, he starts every time you are in Green.\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2008-11-25 23:46:40 +0000\r\nI always get so greedy with removal. If I had a Bone Splinters or an\r\n  \r\nExecutioner's Capsule, I probably would have cut white from the get-go. I\r\n  \r\nalways worry about having an out to big fat dragon-class creatures (which red\r\n  \r\nburn can't handle), so I always try to fit in Oblivion Ring.\r\n\r\nManaplasm was awesome for me exactly once when I played it on turn three with\r\n  \r\na four drop and five drop in hand. But it was also really bad for me exactly\r\n  \r\nonce when I drew it off the top in a losing situation.",

However, I choose not to claim valid XHTML (and no doc type declaration) since I can't guarantee that blog posts I write are compliant! The site uses standard CSS and uses the Blueprint CSS Framework for the grid layout of the page. The site design is entirely original (if not simple and bland -- I'm not very good with website design yet!). The site has minor usage of JQuery Javascript library in some parts.\r\n\r\nBackend: The server side uses Python and Django behind mod_python on Apache, with a MySQL database. The following Django apps and Python libraries are used:\r\n\r\n  custom made blog application by myself\r\n  built-in (contrib) apps: admin, comments, sitemaps, flatpages\r\n  django-tagging\r\n  django-xmlrpc\r\n  comment_utils for advanced comment moderation features\r\n  template_utils\r\n  django-pingback\r\n  Beautiful Soup for XML/HTML parsing\r\n  Pygments for syntax highlighting. See the Pygments Demo!\r\n 10. Feedparser\r\n 11. Markdown2 so that I can post using Markdown.\r\n\r\nAs is typical for hobbyist software development, I started working on this site with only a minimal set of features considered, but as I kept working I kept wanting to add more stuff. Some notable custom-made features:\r\n\r\n  XMLRPC server, supporting Metaweblog API and Pingbacks. I actually only added the metaweblog support so I could post from Flock\r\n  Autocard support (same as my previous Autocard plugin for WP) and syntax highlighting of code.\r\n  Automatic extraction of twitter and delicious entries into the sidebar\r\n  Gravatar support for comments\r\n\r\nAll entries from the previous \"roytang / weblog\", \"Roy on Magic\" and \"Roy on Django\" have been imported using a custom data conversion script, but nothing is perfect so some of the older posts may be badly formatted.

However, the way the url's are set up, there's no easy way to pass this parameter normally, even through query strings. THis lovely bug is documented in http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/8968 \r\n  \r\n. I wasn't confident enough to try patching it, so as a temporary workaround, I overrode the flag and delete templates and placed the following inside the form:\r\n\r\ninput type=\"hidden\" name=\"next\" value=\"{{ comment.get\\content\\object_url }}\" /\r\n\r\n_\r\n  \r\nEdit: Wow that was stupid. Blogger didn't want to render the HTML code above!\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n\r\nI also replaced the URL in the \"cancel\" links for both pages. For some reason, {{ comment.permalink }} wasn't giving me anything useful.\r\n\r\nTook me a bit of work to figure out how the moderation part works. Apparently I have to hook on some of the signals to add my moderation logic. I'm not sure yet how to handle this, or whether I should try customizing the comment form with something like a captcha to prevent comment spam.\r\n\r\nI have a pending problem now that submitting comments from the preview or error page does not redirect to the correct place. (i.e. the post page). I tried adding the next parameter to the form, but apparently comment.get\\content\\object_url returns an empty string here because the comment has not yet been saved to the database. I think the content object should be provided in the context for the preview page. This would be handled by\r\n  \r\nhttp://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9268 \r\n  \r\n, except apparently no one's paying attention to it yet.\r\n\r\nSome random features I added: Gravatar support (the Gravatar for the email address used to post the comment will be shown), and Markdown support in the comment body. Easy stuff.\r\n\r\nCleaned up an refactored the templates that render the comments, separating them from the parts that render the blog posts. This makes it easier if I want to have comments for other non-Blog post objects later.\r\n\r\nNon-comment related:\r\n\r\nAdded simple search!\r\n\r\nThe script to import from WordPress has some problems. Since I'm storing the post body in markdown format, I use\r\n  \r\nhtml2text \r\n  \r\nto convert the HTML body from old posts into markdown, but nice stuff like image alignments and tables are lost. I think I have to make do with editing straight HTML for old posts imported from WordPress, and just clean them up later as needed.\r\n\r\nMy code is rather messy now (especially from the HTML side). I should clean it up sometime soon.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/8968\r\n [2]: http://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/9268\r",

My best guess for the point of attack would have been as I was lined up at the outgoing gates and rummaging through my pockets for the MRT ticket. I'm normally very careful in these situations but I was carrying more stuff than I usually do so I guess I really let my guard down here.\r\n\r\nI've never actually been the victim of petty theft before, so I wasn't sure what to do. I had someone try to call the phone, of course there was no response. We tried to lay a trap by sending a text message along the lines of \"Hi, I'm the beautiful lady who wants to give you P20,000. How can I recognize you since we've never seen each other before?\" but I doubt it would have worked. In the end, I'm told there's really nothing I can do. At least I was running on prepaid so I don't have to cancel the line or anything. And I'm pretty sure I didn't have any sensitive info (passwords, etc.) on the phone.\r\n\r\nMy first reaction was actually annoyance at my own carelessness -- especially since I tend to be vigilant 99% of the time, but that 1% that I let my guard down I actually get bitten. Although looking at it another way, if I wasn't vigilant 99% of the time I might not have lasted so long without having a cellphone stolen. A number of people were amazed that I was taking it mostly as a matter-of-fact, as I should be emo'ing over my lost phone. It's just a phone.\r\n\r\nI'll just imagine that my cellphone went towards providing a nice Christmas dinner for a starving family. Then that happy occasion brings their family back together and convinces the thief to turn away from his life of crime and walk the straight and narrow, and he gets a job and his children get to go to school and become productive members of society.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, farewell N73, I hardly new ye. Any suggestions for a new phone? The features I typically require are:\r\n\r\n  Call/text obviously\r\n  Cameraphone (I use it to take pictures of stuff I need to remember)\r\n  Bluetooth (since I prefer using my laptop to send SMS if possible)\r\n  MP3 player -- actually I wasn't using the MP3 player on the last one recently, but having a player on my phone saves me from buying an Ipod or whatever separately\r\n  Alarm, Tasklist/Event notification -- I am not confident in my ability to wake up early without a cellphone alarm.\r\n\r\nOther features (internet, radio, etc) are lower priority.",

I thought long and hard about the PS3 purchase because obviously it's more expensive than the X-Box 360 and furthermore, and the games are expensive as well. But you gotta go with the best really.\r\n\r\nOur PS3 package came with 2 games of our choice, and we found out just as we were buying that we had to be picky about the regions as most likely R2 games (Europe) would not work on our standard definition NTSC TV. Yup, I had decided not to purchase an HD TV because, well, they're hella expensive! For our two free games, we went with Metal Gear Solid 4 (obviously) and Valkyria Chronicles, both are PS3 exclusives.\r\n\r\nMGS4 is a damn awesome-looking game, even on our SD TV so I can only imagine how much better it would be in HD. I wasn't planning on playing it myself, but instead satisfied myself with watching the cutscenes as my brothers played through it. As is typical of MGS, the game was short and my youngest brother got to the ending cutscene within a mere four days after the PS3 was purchased! Luckily there's still MGS Online and Hard/Extreme modes so there's still some replay value there.\r\n\r\nValkyria Chronicles is the game I'm playing and I'm currently 8 chapters in. From reviews I expected it to be a tactical RPG like FF Tactics and the like, but after playing I find that it reminds me more of squad-based tactical games like X-Com: UFO Defense. The game is rendered in very detailed and beautiful cel shading and is a blast to play and also somewhat hard -- actual tactics are needed to win battles unlike in FFT-style games where typically it's not too hard to power through the battles.\r\n\r\nAnother slight disappointment was that the US Playstation Store wouldn't accept a local credit card for PSN purchases, so I was unable to purchases Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix as it is currently only available on the US PSN. Thanks to some kind folks at the PSPinoy message boards though for facilitating the purchase for me. I was able to successfully download SSF2THDR but was saddened by the lag I experienced while playing online. Hopefully I can tweak some of the network settings on the PS3 to solve the latency issues.\r\n\r\nOverall, the PS3 seems to have been a good solid choice. Now if only I had more time to play games!",

Unfortunately, removal doesn't help if you don't draw it. I lost round 2 to an opposing Mycoloth without drawing any of my O-rings. In round 3 I lost in game 3 to mana screw -- I drew a lot of red burn but the mountain didn't come out until I was on my last legs.\r\n\r\nRound 1: 2-1 win\r\n  \r\nRound 2: 1-2 loss\r\n  \r\nRound 3: 0-2 loss\r\n\r\nI was a bit frustrated due to having a nice pool but bad luck (and admittedly, not so tight plays), so I just dropped after going 1-2. My limited playing has been really bad lately, I hit a GPT top 8 at the very start of the limited season but after that all the GPTs and PTQs I joined I scrubbed out. I think I need to take a break from Magic for a while :p\r\n\r\nWill probably resume playing when Conflux comes out (or if there are any good Standard tourneys in January)",

Tournament report follows.\r\n\r\n!--more--\r\n\r\nSince I usually arrive at Galleria early, I spent a couple of hours waiting for the round to start and watch the people playtesting. I saw a lot of green decks which worried me -- particularly Wilt-Leaf Liege. I haven't played Standard since before the Grand Prix -- I had no idea what was the local metagame coming in.\r\n\r\nI lost round one to a mirror match in two games. It was close, as I lost both games with him at 1 life. I almost won game two when he played two Incinerates during his turn to finish me from six life. I had the Wild Ricochet for the second Incinerate, bringing him down to two. He has one card left in hand and is tapped out and I have four lands and Hell's Thunder in the yard. Any burn spell or land I draw wins me the match. I draw a land and play it and announce \"Unearth Hell's Thunder.\" He wants to call a judge because he's not sure of what he's about to do. He shows me the Faerie Macabre in hand and even though the judge is still coming I already know I've lost.\r\n\r\nAfter the match I asked him for tips on how to play the deck and he told me he just plays out Blightning as soon as possible, whereas I was sandbagging it and playing creatures first.\r\n\r\nRound two I face Shorecrasher/Bant, an early Rhox War Monk sticks around in game one long enough to make it hard for me to win. In game two I get a nice draw with turn two Blossom and 2 Javelins. He's stuck on two lands, missing two land drops before finally playing a Birds of Paradise. My only removal in hand consists of the two Javelins... I decide to overkill the BoP and hope he doesn't draw any more lands. Of course he draws a Flooded Grove next turn and then he plays out his hand and I'm finished off by a growing Shorecrasher.\r\n\r\nStarting out at 0-2. Why do I play Magic again? Seriously, I've been playing badly for a while now.\r\n\r\nI watch the match on the adjacent table while waiting for the next round. I see turn 5 Violent Ultimatim into turn 7 Violent Ultimatum into turn 9 Violent Ultimatum. Geez.\r\n\r\nI play another mirror match in round three, and he hits me with early burn but I stabilize at 2 life and he draws no gas afterwards. I win game two as well.\r\n\r\nRound four I was playing some sort of bant-colored control, and I finally managed to go on the offensive after stripping his hand an stabilizing at four lands. He would Wrath or Condemn away every creature I play, trading one for one, until he draws a card which he was apparently waiting for all this time. He shows me\r\n   \r\nIdyllic Tutor\r\n   \r\nand I have no idea what he's doing. He searches an reveals\r\n   \r\nEnchanted Evening\r\n   \r\n. Crap. He then plays\r\n   \r\nSpring Cleaning\r\n   \r\non my Goblin Deathraiders and I flip mountain, and suddenly I have no permanents on board. I lose shortly thereafter.\r\n\r\nHe mulligans to five in game two and is at four life before having any suitable defense, and I end it quickly. Next game it's my turn as I mulligan to five, sending back one-land hands each time. I lost the third game to Spring Cleaning again. Awesome!\r\n\r\nI drop obviously. I should have stayed at home .\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Idyllic Tutor\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Enchanted Evening\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spring Cleaning\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by r4nd0m1z3r on 2009-01-02 05:04:01 +0000\r\nhi, keep it up, since practice makes perfect.

I eventually just decided to set it up, deploy on webfaction and test it online before I redirected the domain name.\r\n  The documentation mentioned that the pingback handler needs to have the same arguments as the detail view for the post, so I wrote it as follows: div class=\"hl_wrap\"\r\n      table class=\"sourcetable\"\r\n        tr\r\n          td class=\"linenos\"\r\n            pre1\r\n2\r\n3\r\n4/pre\r\n          /td\r\n          \r\n          td class=\"code\"\r\n            div class=\"source\"\r\n              prespan class=\"c\"# exactly same arguments as 'details' view./span\r\nspan class=\"k\"def/span span class=\"nf\"pingbackbloghandler/spanspan class=\"p\"(/spanspan class=\"n\"catslug/spanspan class=\"p\",/span span class=\"n\"year/spanspan class=\"p\",/span span class=\"n\"month/spanspan class=\"p\",/span span class=\"n\"slug/spanspan class=\"p\",/span span class=\"o\"**/spanspan class=\"n\"kwargs/spanspan class=\"p\"):/span\r\n    span class=\"n\"cat/span span class=\"o\"=/span span class=\"n\"Category/spanspan class=\"o\"./spanspan class=\"n\"objects/spanspan class=\"o\"./spanspan class=\"n\"get/spanspan class=\"p\"(/spanspan class=\"n\"slug/spanspan class=\"o\"=/spanspan class=\"n\"catslug/spanspan class=\"p\")/span\r\n    span class=\"k\"return/span span class=\"n\"Post/spanspan class=\"o\"./spanspan class=\"n\"pubobjects/spanspan class=\"o\"./spanspan class=\"n\"get/spanspan class=\"p\"(/spanspan class=\"n\"dateyear/spanspan class=\"o\"=/spanspan class=\"n\"year/spanspan class=\"p\",/span span class=\"n\"date_month/spanspan class=\"o\"=/spanspan class=\"n\"month/spanspan class=\"p\",/span span class=\"n\"slug/spanspan class=\"o\"=/spanspan class=\"n\"slug/spanspan class=\"p\",/span span class=\"n\"category/spanspan class=\"o\"=/spanspan class=\"n\"cat/spanspan class=\"p\",/span span class=\"n\"published/spanspan class=\"o\"=/spanspan class=\"bp\"True/spanspan class=\"p\")/span\r\n/pre\r\n            /div\r\n          /td\r\n        /tr\r\n      /table\r\n    /div\r\n    \r\n    But it wasn't exactly working for me, for some reason the function wasn't being called. After some debugging I found that I needed to use named parameters for catslug, year, month, slug in the URLConf for the post permalink in order for this to work. I'm not sure if this was because I was doing it wrong or it's some sort of undocumented requirement./li \r\n    \r\n      The pingback client was throwing a KeyError whenever a post I made would have anchor tags without an href attribute. Granted that there isn't much point in having an aanchor tag without the href/a, but the code shouldn't just choke on it. I modified the following line in client.py: div class=\"hl_wrap\"\r\n          table class=\"sourcetable\"\r\n            tr\r\n              td class=\"linenos\"\r\n                pre1/pre\r\n              /td\r\n              \r\n              td class=\"code\"\r\n                div class=\"source\"\r\n                  prespan class=\"n\"links/span span class=\"o\"=/span span class=\"p\"[/spanspan class=\"n\"a/spanspan class=\"p\"[/spanspan class=\"s\"'href'/spanspan class=\"p\"]/span span class=\"k\"for/span span class=\"n\"a/span span class=\"ow\"in/span span class=\"n\"soup/spanspan class=\"o\"./spanspan class=\"n\"findAll/spanspan class=\"p\"(/spanspan class=\"s\"'a'/spanspan class=\"p\")/span span class=\"k\"if/span span class=\"n\"is_external/spanspan class=\"p\"(/spanspan class=\"n\"a/spanspan class=\"p\"[/spanspan class=\"s\"'href'/spanspan class=\"p\"],/span span class=\"n\"url/spanspan class=\"p\")]/span\r\n/pre\r\n                /div\r\n              /td\r\n            /tr\r\n          /table\r\n        /div\r\n        \r\n        Adding the check for the href attribute:\r\n        \r\n        div class=\"hl_wrap\"\r\n          table class=\"sourcetable\"\r\n            tr\r\n              td class=\"linenos\"\r\n                pre1/pre\r\n              /td\r\n              \r\n              td class=\"code\"\r\n                div class=\"source\"\r\n                  prespan class=\"n\"links/span span class=\"o\"=/span span class=\"p\"[/spanspan class=\"n\"a/spanspan class=\"p\"[/spanspan class=\"s\"'href'/spanspan class=\"p\"]/span span class=\"k\"for/span span class=\"n\"a/span span class=\"ow\"in/span span class=\"n\"soup/spanspan class=\"o\"./spanspan class=\"n\"findAll/spanspan class=\"p\"(/spanspan class=\"s\"'a'/spanspan class=\"p\")/span span class=\"k\"if/span span class=\"n\"a/spanspan class=\"o\"./spanspan class=\"n\"haskey/spanspan class=\"p\"(/spanspan class=\"s\"'href'/spanspan class=\"p\")/span span class=\"ow\"and/span span class=\"n\"isexternal/spanspan class=\"p\"(/spanspan class=\"n\"a/spanspan class=\"p\"[/spanspan class=\"s\"'href'/spanspan class=\"p\"],/span span class=\"n\"url/spanspan class=\"p\")]/span\r\n/pre\r\n                /div\r\n              /td\r\n            /tr\r\n          /table\r\n        /div/ul \r\n    \r\n    Those are all the changes I made to get pingbacks working.

Quick Review:\r\n\r\n  Beautiful, beautiful game, even on my SD TV; it's like watching a flowing watercolor painting\r\n  When you start the game, all the dialogue/cutscenes seems a bit draggy but eventually you get used to the pacing and then you don't mind because the battles are really engaging. Speaking of battles;\r\n  I'm not sure if it would be good for beginners to tactical games. Unlike the FFT series and similar games, most battles require a decent strategy and grasp of tactics to complete. I kept getting Game Overs at the start because I was playing it like an FFT clone. It actually reminds me more of X-Com: UFO Defense's squad-based tactics. You need to move, shoot, then run for cover. Always make sure your troops aren't open to enemy fire and your tank's weak spot isn't exposed. You pretty much always need to find a way to sneak around the enemy troops as your weaker troops will not often survive rushing headlong into enemy fire. Each class (Scout, Shocktrooper, Lancer, Engineer, Sniper) has a definite role to play and you'll need to know when to use each type of unit. You also need to consider finishing battles as quickly as possible to get higher scores and bonus experience/money. Early battles take around 30 mins to complete; later battles in the neighborhood of 1.5-2 hours. Don't worry, you can save in-battle. (Yes, I sometimes reload when my sniper misses a clear headshot!) It's definitely top-notch tactical gameplay that's innovative compared to other games tagged as SRPGs.\r\n  There's some replay value here also; The New Game Plus mode gives you a chance to try to get higher scores in each battle, plus there are optional Skirmish battles which I will probably try to beat at some point (I finished the game with minimal grinding, so I only played one Skirmish Battle). I wish it had trophies though =/\r\n  Overall, a highly recommended game. Unfortunately it didn't sell very well despite the awesome reviews; the RPG audience is probably very small on the PS3 due to the lack of quality RPG titles for the console, but hopefully Sega decides to release a sequel sometime despite the low sales figures.",

        "content": "---\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2009-02-01 12:59:35\r\ntags:\r\nSoftware Development\r\ntitle: Code Quality\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2009/02/code-quality/\r\n---\r\n\r\nI was doing code reviews on an interface file-processing framework to be used in one of our projects. The code was workable and already being used by several programs, and I didn't see any major functional flaws. But design-wise I felt that it could stand for some improvements/refactoring to be \"better object-oriented code\" or \"easier to maintain\". \r\n\r\nThe current design required a lot of inheritance -- the usual way of doing things in older Java code at work. I was thinking of a more dynamic, declarative design that would require a config file instead of more subclasses but eventually I decided against asking for it. It would have taken maybe a day or two to implement, and the client programs using the framework would need to be rewritten, et cetera. I felt that the improvement in maintainability didn't justify the delay it would introduce.\r\n\r\nI remembered this after reading Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood's discussion on unit tests and code quality. The most relevant quote from their discussion is \r\n\r\n And I find, sadly, to be completely honest with everybody listening, quality really doesn't matter that much, in the big scheme of things... \r\n\r\nIt reminds me of a discussion I once had with the boss on one of his visits when he caught me doing code reviews. He asked me whether it was worth the effort for me to be doing these reviews. How many critical problems did I find on average? How many would have been caught by QA anyway? His point wasn't to diss on code reviews, but was that although we want to have quality, sometimes we put too much effort into it, and the costs don't always justify it. \r\n\r\nI guess part of working smart is knowing exactly how much quality your customers need. As developers, we feel a certain sense of \"pride\" that we want our code to be the best, optimized, et cetera. But polishing it up until you get a \"perfect\" design is also a form of gold-plating as well.\r\n\r\nOn a slight tangent, when I was reading about how they write code at NASA, I was a bit put off at how much effort they put into building perfect code. They had lots of design meetings, going over every piece of code multiple times, et cetera. \r\n\r\n And the culture is equally intolerant of creativity, the individual coding flourishes and styles that are the signature of the all-night software world. \"People ask, doesn't this process stifle creativity? You have to do exactly what the manual says, and you've got someone looking over your shoulder,\" says Keller. \"The answer is, yes, the process does stifle creativity.\"\r\n\r\nI understand that it's the level of quality required for space shuttle software -- literally perfect -- and it makes me glad I'm not writing space shuttle software because stifling creativity doesn't sound fun to me. \r\n\r\nBack to the code review I was doing: I eventually shipped it back with a few minor comments to improve efficiency, but no major changes. I mentioned since the framework was already being used, we should treat the comments as optional. You have to weigh the costs of every change you ask for or every \"Comment by Tester\" you file in the name of code quality or better usability, et cetera. \"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\" is another form of YAGNI I guess.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2009/01/31.html \"From Podcast 38\"\r\n [2]: http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000150.html \"gold-plating blog post on codinghorror\"\r\n [3]: http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/06/writestuff.html?page=0%2C0 \"The Write the Right Stuff\"\r\n [4]: http://c2.com/xp/YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html \"WikiWikiWeb entry for You Aren't Gonna Need It\"\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Aleks on 2009-02-04 00:25:24 +0000\r\nRefactoring is an investment. You should be able to justify the effort to refactor the code on its long-term benefits. \r\n\r\nAs for code reviews, I now think that its effectivity is largely dependent on when it's conducted. It's less effective when the developer is already done with the whole module/functionality and the QA team is about to do their thing. I think it's better to conduct the reviews when the developer has done a little coding and his design has been laid out.\r\n\r\nComment by Aleks on 2009-02-04 00:44:54 +0000\r\nThat's supposed to be:\r\n  \r\nYou \\will\\ be able to justify the effort to refactor the code on its long-term benefits.\r\n\r\n Comment by roy on 2009-02-08 12:42:50 +0000\r\nI know full well about the benefits of refactoring and code reviews. What I'm saying is, there are other factors to consider. \r\n\r\nAs developers who take pride in our work surely you should want to refactor and have someone looking at your code almost all the time. But like all things, software is largely a product of compromise. \r\n\r\nSure, it works out well in the long run. But sometimes you just want to make it through the short run, you have to realize that cutting back on these code quality measures and accepting the technical debt is a viable business option.",

decklists better... _\r\n\r\nThe deck's plan was basically early game skirmish with small exalted guys, use Wall of Reverence to survive midrange before I let loose with huge 5-power and up fatties. Oh, and hitting a turn 3 Woolly Thoctar is pretty good too -- which I managed to do in all of the rounds I won. I really wanted to use the Maelstrom Archangel but sadly there was not enough support.\r\n\r\nRound 1\r\n\r\nGame one we play draw-go for a while and trade creatures unless I go with Spearbreaker Behemoth into Godsire which earned the concession.\r\n\r\nGame two I keep a hand with six lands and a Woolly Thoctar. The third-turn beast pretty much went all the way!\r\n\r\n1-0 matches, 2-0 games\r\n\r\nRound 2\r\n\r\nI'm playing the guy who was two seats to my left during deck registration, and my lifetime match record against him is somewhere in the range of 1-20 in his favor. This round is no exception to the trend, as my deck fails to perform. I sandbag an Oblivion Ring for too long instead of using it to take out his Scepter of Dominance. I was holding it back for any super bomb creatures, but I remembered that I was the one who registered his pool. I should have known he had no super bomb creatures!\r\n\r\n1-1 matches, 2-2 games\r\n\r\nAh, the elusive 4-0. When will I taste it again?\r\n\r\nRound 3\r\n\r\nGame one goes long, as we both have answers to each others threats, and I had gained around 30ish life from my Wall of Reverence. While my wall is holding him back, he gums up the board with Vithian Stinger and Scattershot Archers, preventing me from playing my hapless 1/1 exalted dudes that just hang around in my hand. Eventually, he shows me Malfegor from his hand and discards four lands, wiping my board. He doesn't manage to kill me, but between cyclers and card drawers I ran out of cards in my library before I could push through the last few points to win.\r\n\r\nI hated having the stupid 1/1s stuck in my hand so I sideboarded with: -2 Aven Squire, -1 Sighted-Caste Sorcerer, -1 Akrasan Squire, +2 Celestial Purge, +1 Savage Hunger, +1 Dark Temper, going into a more controllish build.\r\n\r\nGame two, I have a forest and a plains and a Woolly Thoctar in my opener, and I dutifully play plains and forest on the first two turns. On the third turn, I announce \"Mountain\" before ripping it off the top and playing the third turn Thoctar. He eventually manages to wipe me with Malfegor again, but I was too far ahead and managed to eke out the win anyway.\r\n\r\nGame three, I know we're short on time so I try to play quickly. We're trading creatures again, but I manage to stabilize with Wall of Reverence and Exuberant Firestoker in play. I need to make a crucial decision when he plays out Fleshbag Marauder with around two minutes left on the clock (the flight judge was sitting beside us showing us the timer). Keeping the wall helps me live longer, but I had Godsire in hand and the Exuberant meant I just needed to wait for two more lands, so I sac the wall, playing to win.\r\n\r\nSure enough, with barely seven seconds left on the clock, I rip the seventh land, play the Godsire and say \"End of turn, you take two from Exuberant, go!\". That drops him to 15 and gives me three extra turns to end it with the Godsire. He thinks real hard on his turn, then lays down Spearbreaker Behemoth to stand in the way. I untap in the first extra turn and show him the last card in my hand -- Oblivion Ring. His Behemoth goes bye-bye and I deal nine damage in the red zone, plus two damage from the Exuberant, dropping him to four. He untaps, draws his card, shakes his head and offers the handshake. \r\n\r\nThat game was a rush... \r\n\r\n2-1 matches, 4-3 games\r\n\r\nRound 4\r\n\r\nGame one he leads with Rip-clan Crasher into Dragon Fodder, but I stabilize with third-turn Thoctar (again) and take control of the game from there, despite getting wiped by Volcanic Fallout\r\n\r\nI board the same way I did in round two. I don't want to give too much card advantage to Volcanic Fallout!\r\n\r\nGame two goes by quickly in his favor, as he starts with Rip-clan and Goblin tokens again but this time I don't draw the needed lands to stabilize.\r\n\r\nNow, I've been choosing to draw instead of play all this time, and I stick to that decision in game three, despite the mad aggro rush I got hit with in the second game. We both mulligan to six, and he keeps his hand. But I see only one land in my six-carder so I send it back. Five cards yields no lands at all, and finally I keep 2 plains, Oblivion Ring and Savage Hunger. This was not a good way for me to end the day!\r\n\r\nFortunately, he had kept a subpar six, drawing his red mana only on turn three, giving me time to cycle into more lands and business spells. I eventually manage to hit Woolly Thoctar and Wall of Reverence together, stabilizing the board with an extra five life gained per turn and eventually manage to eke out the win. Winning from a mulligan to four is always nice!\r\n\r\n3-1 matches, 6-4 games\r\n\r\nWrap-up\r\n  \r\nNot a bad prerelease, and Conflux looks fun, but I'm not too sure how good the five-color cards will be once Alara Reborn comes out. Celestial Purge is pretty awesome and I think it's even better than Path to Exile which is really bad in the early turns. I would have maindecked it if not for the possibility of being a dead card against Bant decks. If only it had cycling! Sad that we did not open any Banefire.\r\n\r\nStill not sure if I'll be playing constructed again anytime soon... \r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wall of Reverence\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Maelstrom Archangel\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spearbreaker Behemoth\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Godsire\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Woolly Thoctar\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Oblivion Ring\r\n [7]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scepter of Dominance\r\n [8]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Vithian Stinger\r\n [9]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scattershot Archers\r\n [10]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Malfegor\r\n [11]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Aven Squire\r\n [12]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sighted-Caste Sorcerer\r\n [13]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Akrasan Squire\r\n [14]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Celestial Purge\r\n [15]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Savage Hunger\r\n [16]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Dark Temper\r\n [17]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Exuberant Firestoker\r\n [18]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Fleshbag Marauder\r\n [19]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rip-clan Crasher\r\n [20]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Dragon Fodder\r\n [21]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Volcanic Fallout\r\n [22]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Path to Exile\r",

/div\r\n/div\r\n\r\nAs you can note, I used only 1 out of 6 of my rares. People at nearby tables were exclaiming how they got so many bombs they were using 5 out of 6 rares. Well, whatever, that's how sealed deck goes. For my build, I was trying to go for early starts with 2- and 3-drops and just use the removal to take them out of the way and go aggro before any of my opponent's bombs could come online. I wish I could've fitted in the 2nd Armillary Sphere and the 2 Gleam of Resistance, but I didn't want to have to cut more creatures.\r\n\r\nI won rounds one and two. The last game in round two was a real squeaker, where I managed to pull through despite my opponent's pool having Volcanic Fallout, Martial Coup and Banefire.\r\n\r\nThings went downhill from there. I lost both games of round 3 with my opponent having Nicol Bolas in play with the requisite loyalty to go postal on me. In round four I played really sloppily making a few miscounts of power/toughness and wasting some Drag Downs in the process. However, I had really bad draws in both games of round four; even I had played tightly I probably would still have lost.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to blame the deck, but there were so many issues during deck construction that I'm pretty sure a much better build exists. I don't know whether I should have maindecked the 2 Scattershot Archers, they would have been pretty bad in rounds 1-3 but awesome in round 4. Looking at my pool now it might be possible to work in blue, losing green in the process. Blue gives me fliers, card draw and protection from red, but I guess it would have been more of a late game deck and I didn't really want my games to go long.\r\n\r\nLooking at the upcoming NG events, most are for extended so I guess I will still not be playing much Magic in February. Gives me time to think of a deck I want to play.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Armillary Sphere\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Gleam of Resistance\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Volcanic Fallout\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Martial Coup\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Banefire\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Drag Down\r",

They can only use the planeswalker abilities. The goal is to destroy all planeswalkers on the opposing side.\r\n\r\nIf player A goes first, can he win?

Tezzeret twiddles his thumbs.\r\n\r\nPlayer A goes first: with no library considerations, Bolas kills Elspeth. Sarkhan gains loyalty, Ajani Lightning Helixes him, and Tezzeret does nothing important (can he gain loyalty?). Bolas picks off Sarkhan, the two remaining wait to die. With artifact creatures in library, Bolas kills Tezzeret, Player B retaliates as above, Bolas kills Elspeth, Sarkhan pumps critter, Ajani twiddles thumbs, Bolas kills Sarkhan, then Ajani.\r\n\r\nComment by roy on 2009-02-10 07:38:58 +0000\r\nBah, I guess it was too easy. :p",

I finished Star ocean: Second Evolution for the PSP today, clocking in 30 hours of playtime. I have to say I quite enjoy playing RPGs on handhelds. RPGs are usually rather long games so it's nice being able to handle them in bite-sized chunks while commuting, et cetera.\r\n\r\nStar Ocean: The Second Story was probably one of the best Japanese RPGs to come out of the Playstation era, despite the lackluster translations of that time (hey, it was pre-year 2000, all translations were pretty bad then!) Now comes the PSP enhanced remake, featuring a brand new retranslation, anime cutscenes, new VAs, an additional character, et cetera. The works! I've been playing it during off times for about two weeks, and pretty much had Claude overlevelled most of the time since I never removed him from the party.\r\n\r\nWith the PS1 version I never managed to complete the optional stuff like the Cave of Trials bonus dungeon and the harder difficulty levels due to lack of time. Hopefully the handheld version will allow me to do those things; I will probably play the Rena story on one of the higher difficulty levels.\r\n\r\nThe PSP version is spot-on awesome, and makes me want to play Star Ocean: Til the End of Time again. I'm glad that there are still some good games coming out on the PSP despite the high level of piracy on the platform (not that I'm helping =/) Hopefully Sony comes out with a handheld that can support the PS2 generation of games. \r\n\r\nStar Ocean: Second Evolution is a very deep game with a decent story and great battle system plus lots of extra stuff to do, so it's highly recommended, especially for fans of the PS1 version. \r\n\r\nSide Note: Luckily, I haven't tried Star Ocean: First Departure. I say luckily because it's supposedly quite bad. It was a generation ahead of Second Story so I guess they weren't very good then.",

I could've been able to forgive the fact that they roughly 80% of the story shied away from Street Fighter canon, had the movie's storyline actually been good. As it is, you can expect short, unsatisfying fight scenes, ridiculous background stories, disjointed plot/scenes (reminds me of Smallville and/or Heroes writing =/), terrible wigs and the ridiculous sight of Michael Clark Duncan getting beaned by a pineapple.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if it was a problem with the theater's copy, but there were no subtitles for the Chinese/Thai dialogues, which made up a nontrivial portion of the movie. Also, did they really, absolutely need to have the Kikoushou? The internal world of the movie would have been so much more consistent if Chun-Li did not magically learn the ability to create a fireball from nothing. And it's totally unexplained as well!\r\n\r\nNash and Maya were pretty much useless. Gen, supposedly a really old guy who's a rival for Akuma, was played by the same guy who played Liu Kang in Mortal Kombat, except he was wearing a really bad wig and apparently could not die. Michael Clark Duncan is wasted in his role as Balrog, who is not even hinted to be a boxer at all... in fact he went so far as to use a bow and arrow in this movie. (Oh, and getting beaned by a pineapple)\r\n\r\n@altealice asks: are there enough lolz to make watching it worthwhile?\r\n\r\nIt depends on how mababaw you are at the time I guess. The plain ridiculousness of the storyline makes you want to facepalm. Things seem to happen at random and with no explanation (It's never explained why the hell Bison took Chun-li's father.) I wouldn't recommend watching it in the moviehouse, but maybe pickup a pirated DVD :p\r\n\r\nAt least, it's still better than the Van Damme movie.\r\n\r",

The light blue theme is named Azorius, while the old black and green theme is named Golgari, both named after the respective color guilds in Magic: The Gathering's Ravnica block.\r\n\r\nHopefully this gives me a chance to whip up more interesting themes and polish the old CSS skills some more.

The first part of the talk is mostly about a Document Management System he worked on, kinda interesting, but the second part is better where he talks about people who program cool things as a hobby and how to avoid becoming just another corporate code.\r\n\r\nOh, and I really just wanted to test my OEmbed implementation on this here Django-powered blog :p\r\n\r\nGot the video via Leah Culver.\r\n\r",

(if I do say so myself): ok removal, 3 pyroclasm effects, the white scepter which is good at board control. No blowout bombs, but quite possible to 6-1 or 7-0 with it. If only the pilot was someone much better than me... \r\n\r\nI win round one, lose round two, win round three, then lose two in a row, taking me straight out of top eight contention. I win a tight round six, then the server knocks everyone offline; I get back on, but my round seven opponent does not, so free win. Final record: 4-3.\r\n\r\nI made so many misplays I lost track of them already. Most of them were really minor stuff, such as:\r\n\r\n  1. Swinging with Ember Weaver before playing the Dragonsoul Knight in my hand;\r\n  1. Playing Mountain first when I had Rupture Spire and Arcane Sanctum and no turn one or two plays; \r\n  1. Pumping my Knight of the Skyward Eye in response to a Dark Temper because I forgot that Shambling Remains was black\r\n  1. Not using Bant Battlemage to save my nonflier from a modal Branching Bolt (I'm pretty sure giving it flying would make it an invalid target, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong)\r\n\r\nNone of the above plays set me behind so much, but the collective effect lost me some close games and led to the dismal record. \r\n\r\nOne thing I noticed is that I should stop checking out my opponent's rating at the start of my match, I've noticed that I have a subconscious tendency to make loose plays against opponents I perceive to be weaker, even if I'm only ahead by a few rating points. I need to be able to play tight all the time if I want to be a serious tournament contender.\r\n\r\nAlso, I've noticed there are cards that I'm not sure how to evaluate, such as Manaforce Mace, which I never use because it seems so slow at 4cc/3equip, but I got my ass whupped by that card in one of the games.\r\n\r\nPlaying Limited now feels so different from playing Limited back when I wasn't a serious tournament player; I now spot a lot more mistakes and see a lot more room for improvement in my game. Unlike constructed where there's a lot less variation in the number of interactions, in Limited basically anything can happen so you need to learn to react to a lot more situations. Maybe I should focus more on Limited again (if only it weren't so expensive!)\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Ember Weaver\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Dragonsoul Knight\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rupture Spire\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Arcane Sanctum\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Knight of the Skyward Eye\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Dark Temper\r\n [7]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Shambling Remains\r\n [8]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bant Battlemage\r\n [9]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Branching Bolt\r\n [10]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Manaforce Mace\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Jaime on 2009-03-01 16:54:34 +0000\r\nWow, long time since I've played magic myself. Good thing you can keep up with the card upkeeps. And I guess just a bit more practice?\r\n\r\nAlso, Re: \"I'm pretty sure giving it flying would make it an invalid target, feel free to correct me if I'm wrong\", I think you're right, since the card states \"deals 3 damage to target creature with/without flying\" versus \"Target a flying/non-flying creature, and Branching Bolt deals 3 damage to it.\"\r\n\r\nComment by Jaime on 2009-03-02 01:35:23 +0000\r\nTo clarify, the spell wouldn't fizzle, but it would deal no damage. Hmm. Magic Lawyering is tough stuff. Am I wrong in that you can theoretically target a non-flying creature with the flying component but it won't deal damage unless you can somehow give it flying before it resolves?\r\n\r\n Comment by roy on 2009-03-02 07:01:35 +0000\r\nIf the target is not legal upon resolution, the spell will not resolve (fizzles)\r\n\r\nYou can't target a nonflyer with the flyer mode.\r\n\r\nComment by Daniel Duterte on 2009-03-11 04:19:35 +0000\r\nManaforce Mace is very playable when you have 4+ basic land types. I think it's also probably fine when you're only 3, but I wouldn't pick it very highly in the third pack.",

More precisely, I love playing Magic. I want to play spells, to match wits with my opponents, to recover from mana screw, to win from one life, to make bad plays then learn from them. I want to become a better player, with better skills and better execution. I'm in it for the game, and trading gets in the way of that. \r\n\r\nDon't get me wrong, it's not the cost I don't like: it's the hassle. (That doesn't mean I'm not picky on the cost though... ) I don't want to walk around tournament sites flipping through people's binders. I don't want to keep asking people if they have rare card X that's hard to find. I don't want to have to haggle over card prices. I don't want to have to figure out if I'm being ripped off. I don't want to bring around my own binder. I don't want to arrange for meetups during the week just to get those hard-to-find cards for the weekend's tournaments.\r\n\r\nI just want to play. And the fact that Magic is a collectible game annoys me sometimes, because where exists a game that combines luck and skill in an excellent manner, the limitation of card availability creates an artificial barrier of time, effort and money for someone to play competitively. (Which is why I can't play Extended... )\r\n\r\nThis is why I love limited. It distills Magic down into its' purest form: you show up, you build your deck, then you play. No loitering around card shops trying to find the cards you need, no last-minute borrowing of cards. Show up. Build deck. Play.\r\n\r\nI've been drafting on MTGO again lately, and I wonder why they can't have that sort of thing for constructed. That is: you show up for an event, pay a reasonable entry fee, have access to all the cards in your format of choice, build a deck, then play. No trading barrier. At the end of the event, you give back all the cards you used. It's not something achievable in the real world due to potential theft issues, but in MTGO it's completely viable. I understand that doing this would drive the prices of cards and boosters down, but that's only if it were a common thing. If such events were only held say, once every 1-2 months then the impact shouldn't be that much. Hell, if handled well, it would promote card sales.\r\n\r\nI just want to play. Is that too much to ask?\r\n\r\nRoy will hopefully have something for the coming Standard PTQ season. Finally, a format I can play!\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Jaime on 2009-03-21 23:13:10 +0000\r\nWhile admittedly, I've never been a good player per se, I have to agree with this post 100%. I really preferred the online magic tools that allowed you to play and make your own deck. But they've never really been able to catch up to the most recent cards, and they never have a following as good as MTG played IRL.",

I step out of Maxim's, a fastfood place near the office in Hong Kong. I flew in to HK the morning of the day before, and had given a presentation over a conference call on Thursday night. This was the only free time I had during the entire trip since I had to fly back the next morning. I decided to take a walk for maybe an hour or 30 minutes, to savor the cool night's weather before going back to hot and humid Manila the next day.\r\n\r\nI remember the view from the 22nd floor office that the harbor was nearby. I figured I should get a closeup view of the harbor, something I had not done before. So I walked in the general direction of where I thought the water would be. The chilly wind of fourteen degrees bit against my cheeks as I navigated the North Point side streets.\r\n\r\nEventually I found myself following a road of decommissioned cars and abandoned taxis underneath one of Hong Kong's many flyovers. I was certain this road would lead to a view of the bay from the ground. As I approached, I saw that the walls nearby were filled with colorful graffiti, reminding me of gangland streets in old 80's shows. A faint whirring sound could be heard and as I got nearer I saw there were two middle-aged men towards the entrance of a small yet brightly-lit cul-de-sac at the end of the road. One of them was holding something in his hands and seemed to be controlling a nearby device. The source of the whirring sound had been a model helicopter, and he was flying it around at a low altitude. The two men glanced my way as I passed, but otherwise paid me no heed.\r\n\r\nI watched their helicopter for a few minutes, fascinated. I've never seen one of these in action back home, and I wondered why these men participated in their hobby in these abandoned corners. I shrugged and headed to the end of the cul-de-sac. There, near a metal railing bordering the asphalt and the water's edge, another two men lounged lazily on wooden benches. Standing against the railing were two twelve-feet long steel poles. Ah, they're fishing, I thought to myself. They didn't look like they did this for a living, so I assumed they were hobbyists who only had this time of night and no other nearby source of fish. I watched them for a while, amazed that the harbor actually contains catchable fish. I wonder if Manila Bay has any fishermen?\r\n\r\nIt's 9:00 pm. I'm walking along a sidewalk following a metal railing tracing the water's edge. Above me, the same flyover carries numerous vehicles to and from Hong Kong's busy districts. But around me, it's dead quiet. Mostly. The only other people nearby are a young couple walking ahead of me obviously taking an enjoyable moonlit stroll along the otherwise abandoned road. The girl, wearing a vivid red sweater laughingly teases the young man and they rush ahead. I hope I didn't scare me.\r\n\r\nAs I follow the coast I begin to see boats. Dozens of them, some no larger than an automobile. Most made of wood and apparently barely floating. Some have people sleeping in them and I wonder whether they live in those boats by choice or maybe it was difficult to find somewhere to live on Hong Kong's streets? One of the boats has a lantern and is moving in parallel to where I'm walking. I wave to the grizzled old man manning the boat and he waves back.\r\n\r\nI walk some more, and the sounds of busy city life are slowly catching up. In stark contrast to the lonely sidewalk I had been following, the lights of one of the commercial districts had come into view and I could catch the names of several familiar companies atop tall buildings in the distance. I step onto the sidewalk beside a busy coastal road and find myself welcomed by the lights and sounds of fast-moving vehicular traffic.\r\n\r\nAs I crossed the bridge, I passed upon a fenced-off section at the water's edge and inside spied something mounted upon an elevated stone platform. It was covered in a blue tarpaulin but once I was close it was obvious what it was: it was a cannon! A nearby marker told me it was the Jardines Noonday Gun, a relic from the olden days that was still occasionally fired for charity. I wanted to see what it looked like, but the metal gate leading into the area was locked. I tried to push the images of FF7's Mako Cannon out of my head.\r\n\r\nI walk past a large dome-shaped building near the coast. The sign at the gate tells me it's the Police Officer's Club; I guess the police are well off in Hong Kong. Beyond that there was a lot filled with ships hulls partially built and mounted on elevated rails. Some sort of shipyard I guess. Perhaps the police officers liked to ride yachts. I walked around to the other side of the fenced-off building and I saw inside a strange thing: there large, parallel beams inside a lowered area perhaps some fifteen feet below, and bright lights were emanating from the cracks in between. I peered though the metal link fence and recognized the sounds of cars whizzing by below and I realized that I was looking down at the Cross Harbour Tunnel. If I jumped down below I could cross into Kowloon!\r\n\r\nIt's almost 9:30pm and I've been walking for an hour. I thought I should start looking for a way back, yet I didn't want to merely retrace my steps. I was already near a commercial area that seemed to be quite far from where I started. Eventually I came upon a cemented footbridge that would let me cross to the other side of the busy highway, and I figured that was the way I would go back.\r\n\r\nI climbed up the steps and found myself crossing a quiet yet well-maintained walkway, well above the busy traffic I had left below. I saw the AIA tower in the distance and figured I could use it as a guidepost to find my way back. I stepped down at the other end of the footbridge and find myself crossing a familiar looking road underneath yet-another flyover. My suspicions were confirmed when I followed some lights and saw that I was in the middle of one of Hong Kong's famous commercial districts -- Causeway Bay.\r\n\r\nI've been here before, but not at this hour. I'm walk past the crowds and follow the lights, eventually finding myself in the midst of a street market in front of the Sogo department store. The signage and lights in this area are impossibly bright for the time of day, making you wonder whether they had received the memo that dusk had already come. A lady carrying a microphone and wearing a neon green jacket was glancing around at the crowds, accompanied by a cameraman. Some TV reporter perhaps? In any case I didn't feel like giving an interview. I walked on.\r\n\r\nExiting from the World Trade Centre building, I found that I had been walking in the wrong direction, away from AIA tower. No doubt distracted by the bright lights of the commercial district, I resolved to make my way back as I was now getting the urge to take a leak. .<\r\n\r\nIt's 10pm now and I'm close to getting back. I cross some streets and find myself walking through some sort of large park. I pass by several clusters of teenagers, busily chatting away on park benches and also a number of old people, apparently taking their night-time jogs. A lot of people are also walking dogs (I wonder why they do all these things at night), and I pass by a smallish lady with a gigantic St. Bernard, perhaps larger than me were he not on all fours. I considered petting the beast as I passed, but wasn't sure if I could afford being pounced upon by such a huge canine.\r\n\r\nI stop to watch some kids playing on swings nearby, and beyond the cluster of treetops inside the park I spotted the familiar glow of the AIA tower, now closer than ever. I realized that I must have been walking through Victoria Park, the only large park near North Point, and I was close to getting back to my quarters. Sure enough, crossing a few streets later I found myself raising my hands in triumph. Fortress Hill!\r\n\r\nIt's 10:30 pm and my feet are killing me. I manage to get back to my room at YesInn, dead tired. Yet slightly amazed that I was able to walk so far in the dead of night; I'm not sure I would have dared all those side streets I wandered through had I been in Quezon City. The nights in Hong Kong feel safer somehow, for even the loneliest alleys were brightly-lit. I was also a bit disappointed that nothing more exciting had happened during my walk, perhaps that's the tradeoff for the safety on the streets.\r\n\r\nI was dead tired and prepared for bed. Still, I was glad for the chance to walk and be distracted and not having to think about life's worries. There's a lot to be said for aimless wandering that many people would not understand.\r\n\r\nThe next day I would return to Manila, back to the grind of everyday life.\r\n\r\nAuthor's note: I wish I did have something more interesting to write about, but it was really a short, uneventful two-night stay in Hong Kong. Still, I felt I needed to blog about it, so that I have a record that I was in HK at this time. For more small details on my trip, I've been posting on twitter.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://twitter.com/roytang\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by noemi on 2009-03-27 10:35:58 +0000\r\ni did something like that the one and only time i've been to HK. its different no? although it was my first time there, i wasnt scared of anything happening. well, mostly i did walk along busy streets. but it was rare that a street is empty. its teeming with night markets and shops and all.\r\n\r\nginawa mo nang quiapo ang hk a.\r\n\r\nComment by roy on 2009-03-27 23:31:52 +0000\r\nI've actually did this the first time I was there before.

Nassif's deck, but tweaked with some singletons that I like. I'm not exactly sold on 4x Broken Ambitions, so I replaced two with the miser's Negate and Remove Soul which was good enough to catch some people by surprise. Obelisk of Alara replaces the second Broodmate Dragon; while it's not as quick a finisher as the dragon, it has the added effect of helping to stabilize the board. It pretty much acts like a planeswalker, except it's harder to remove.\r\n\r\nDuring FNM this week, I played a prelim version of the above decklist that had -1 Broken Ambitions, +1 Mind Stone in the MD, because I wanted more mana. My FNM results:\r\n\r\nRound 1 2-0 win vs Bant Aggro\r\n  \r\nRound 2 2-1 win vs Monored Aggro/Burn\r\n  \r\nRound 3 1-1-1 draw vs 5cc (mirror)\r\n  \r\nRound 4 1-2 loss vs White Weenie\r\n\r\nI punted that last round and kept a 2-land hand that didn't have any &#8216;drifters or charms to draw into lands (should have mulled), but otherwise I felt the deck played great. I only got manascrewed once in 4 rounds, so I figured the 26 lands were enough and cut the Mind Stone for the 2nd Broken Ambitions when I sleeved up for the Saturday tournament.\r\n\r\nSaturday, March 28, NG Galleria, the format is standard.\r\n\r\nRound 1 vs U/B Faeries\r\n\r\nAh, the former scourge of the format, now reduced to a shell of its' former self. In both games my opponent stalled on lands allowing me to bring a big enough mana advantage to take control and win.\r\n\r\n2-0 games, 1-0 matches\r\n\r\nRound 2 vs RGB Tokens\r\n\r\nA roguish deck he has, though I've seen similar stuff before. I'm looking at Bitterblossominto Marsh Flitter into Grave Pact during game one. I have the Esper Charm, but I refuse to take out the token-generator, instead using it to draw into sweepers. Eventually, Fallout and &#8216;Blossom take him down to eight and he's in topdeck mode. I lay down the Obelisk and it's over in two turns.\r\n\r\nGame two he manages to get out a swarm early and I stall on four lands. I'm able to sweep once, but nothing beyond that.\r\n\r\nGame three he mulligans to five and he remarks that his deck must know he's already hungry (it was past one). He gets out an early &#8216;Blossom, but I go turn four Plumeveil into turn five Wall of Reverence and manage to get to around 34 life while his Bitterblossom had slowly brought him down to seven life. I laid down Broodmate Dragon and he offered the handshake.\r\n\r\n4-1 games, 2-0 matches\r\n\r\nRound 3 vs 5-color control\r\n\r\nIt's a good thing I played FNM the night before, it means I now know how to play the mirror. During game one, I strip his hand using Liliana + Esper Charms, then I manage to resolve an Ultimatum, then the Obelisk takes him down to zero.\r\n\r\nGame two I take an early lead on lands, then resolve Jace then take away a third of his library a few turns later. I milled something in the neighborhood of 14 lands, so it was really tough for him to recover; he was stuck on seven land while I had something like fifteen on my side. Land is awesome!\r\n\r\nSide note: In that last game, Cruel Ultimatum was played three times in three consecutive turns!\r\n\r\n6-1 games, 3-0 matches\r\n\r\nRound 4 vs U/R Swans/Counterburn\r\n\r\nNo creatures, so my Plumeveils were pretty much dead. We were going draw-go for something like the first ten turns, but he had the annoying Reliquary Tower which allowed him to skip discarding whenever he missed a drop, so he had like a grip of ten cards or so and then he attempted to resolve Jace and started abusing +2 obviously planning to deck me. I bounced it once at his EOT, then when he tried to resolve it again, we went into a counter war. I let him the counter war and resolve Jace, but by then he was tapped out. EOT discard 2 from Esper Charm, then untap and play Cruel Ultimatum, taking out what remained of his hand. I had my own Jace to take out his Jace, then I just took control from there.\r\n\r\nGame two he starts with the Jaces again, but I resolve a Pithing Needle to end those shenanigans. I kept my Plumeveils in, assuming he would be boarding in creatures of some sort, and he showed me Vendillion Clique. We wiped away each other's critteers with Fallout, then eventually I resolved Liliana, then pulled out the Obelisk to win the game.\r\n\r\n8-1 games, 4-0 matches\r\n\r\nRound 5 vs B/W Tokens\r\n\r\nIt's my first time playing this matchup, so I'm not sure what to expect. In game one, I get hit with disruption -- he has all four Tidehollow Scullers come out against me. I waste my single Wrath against the first two and immediately regret it when he follows up with a Cloudgoat and a turn later, the third Sculler. I have four lands untapped and am at 9 life, with Fallout and Celestial Purge in my hand. If I let the Sculler resolve and take the Fallout, I can use the Purge to get it back, but then I'd take six from Cloudgoat and friends. I play Fallout with the Sculler trigger on the stack, taking out Scully and 3 soldiers at the same time, and RFG'ing one card from my hand permanently. I eventually lost the game and one of the bystanders told me that was a bad play, but from where I was sitting I just wanted to prevent as much damage as I can. No, the bad play in the game was wasting Wrath on the first two Scullers.\r\n\r\nSecond game I board in Infests, Wraths and the Scourglass. I keep a hand with Plumeveils, Infests and Fallout, but light on permission. He plays Finks into Glorious Anthem into Ajani Goldmane into 2nd Finks into 2nd Anthem, and soon I'm losing to 6/5 Finks. Not sure what I could have done here; I wasn't expecting the Finks since I wasn't really familiar with the BW decklist.\r\n\r\n8-3 games, 4-1 matches\r\n\r\nRound 6 vs RW (Boat Brew/Reveillark?)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure exactly if this was Boat Brew or Reveillark, since I'm not familiar with the difference between the two. Game one he had early Figure of Destinys, but was constrained by being stuck on two Battlefield Forge and a Windbrisk Heights. I take control easily with Plumeveils.\r\n\r\nGame two, I see the Reveillarks for the first time and play poorly against it. I lose quickly.\r\n\r\nGame three is exciting, he sets up some early damage then uses Flamekin Harbinger to bring out the first Reveillark. He starts setting up Reveillark and Siege-Gang Commander chains, and I have to basically sweep every turn or die. I go as low as one life (if he had a Mogg Fanatic in the graveyard) before he finally ran out of Reveillarks. End of his turn, I flash in Plumeveil, then untap and use Esper Charm on his Oblivion Ring which had taken my Wall of Reverence, allowing me to gain four life at the end of my turn. From there I slowly climb back up, then draw into my Broodmate Dragon to take back the almost-lost game.\r\n\r\n10-4 games, 5-1 matches\r\n\r\nROund 7 vs 5-color control\r\n\r\nI'm 3rd in the standings, and the top 6 get Alara Reborn prerelease passses, so I figure I can draw in to the top six but my opponent, who is 4th thinks he won't make it. So despite my being tired from the mental energy needed for my deck, I shuffle it up and go to battle.\r\n\r\nGame one I stick Jace and actually manage to go off with the -10 ability, leaving him with tenish cards in his library. However at that time he resolves Broodmate Dragon and I have no defense against it, so I still lose.\r\n\r\nGame two I board in Finks and Wydwen, planning to go aggro. He went with the same game plan, so we raced for a few turns, but eventually I managed to take out his lone attacker (Wydwen) and my Finks went all the way for the win.\r\n\r\nGame three, we were low on time. He had boarded in Sceptre of Fugue, but I didn't even bother trying to get rid of them, instead going aggro to try to take him down before time ran out. I resolve Jace to keep from losing too much card advantage, but then he plays the second Sceptre. We go to time during his turn, and he resolves Cruel Ultimatum, leaving only Jace on my side of the board and him with five cards in hand. I untap and topdeck Lilandra then resolve her. He knows I can just tutor for Ultimatum to recover lost life and there's no way he can win in the extra turns, so we get a draw anyway.\r\n\r\nIt later turns out that I was right; he still ends up in the top six despite the draw, and we both got free prerelease passes.\r\n\r\nFinal Record\r\n  \r\n11-5-1 games, 5-1-1 matches, finishing 3rd.\r\n\r\nPretty good performance. I actually only wanted to get in some practice before City Champs which is in April, so winning the prerelease passes is a pretty good plus. Frankly, I'm glad I was able to play all seven rounds without getting too tired. I had to come in at 7:30am at work so that I could get to Galleria by 11, so I only had around four and a half hours of sleep; despite that I was still able to pilot the control deck decently (most of the time), so I guess it's really feasible for me to play control right now.\r\n\r\nIt looks Five-Color Control will be my weapon of choice in Standard, at least until Alara Reborn kicks in and we have to evaluate the metagame again. I need more practice against BW Tokens and RW decks though, as I'm still not very familiar with those matchups (they became prevalent during my short constructed hiatus). Not sure if I have time to play next week, due to some work activities next weekend, so this may have been my last practice session before City Champs!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Broken Ambitions\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Negate\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Remove Soul\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Obelisk of Alara\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Broodmate Dragon\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Mind Stone\r\n [7]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bitterblossom\r\n [8]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Marsh Flitter\r\n [9]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Grave Pact\r\n [10]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Esper Charm\r\n [11]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Plumeveil\r\n [12]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wall of Reverence\r\n [13]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Cruel Ultimatum\r\n [14]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Reliquary Tower\r\n [15]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Vendillion Clique\r\n [16]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Tidehollow Sculler\r\n [17]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Celestial Purge\r\n [18]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Glorious Anthem\r\n [19]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Ajani Goldmane\r\n [20]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Figure of Destiny\r\n [21]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Battlefield Forge\r\n [22]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Windbrisk Heights\r\n [23]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Reveillark\r\n [24]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Flamekin Harbinger\r\n [25]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Siege-Gang Commander\r\n [26]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Oblivion Ring\r\n [27]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sceptre of Fugue\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Benj on 2009-03-30 13:29:50 +0000\r\nCongrats on the great performance, and for winning the PR passes.

The one time I came in late to work during the month of February was because of Street Fighter IV.\r\n\r\nStreet Fighter IV came in with ridiculously high reviews for both the XBox 360 and PS3 versions, the PS3 version garnering a 94 (universal acclaim) on Metacritic It can't be denied that it's an awesome game, although not everyone agrees. I'm not going to discuss all the details of the game, you can click through the links above to read more.\r\n\r\nOne thing we always judge our fighting games on is the \"random fighter selection\" feature. SF3: Third Strike didn't have it, but CvS2 and we played that a lot more than SF3 (and we would have never played SF3 had our PS2 not given up on our CvS2 disk). SF4 has a random fighter selection feature, but it's a bit substandard since (a) You can cancel out of whatever selection it randomly gave you and (b) I got six Dhalsims out of seven randoms today! That's insane. Also, in versus mode you have to move the selection cursor back to the random slot when choosing the next fighter (mildly annoying)\r\n\r\nAnother neat feature: during versus matches, the game keeps tracks of continuous wins! Street Fighter sessions at home are generally won in a \"five-in-a-row\" basis, i.e. the first player to win five bouts in a row is considered the winner and the session ends. So this feature is pretty useful for us.\r\n\r\nWe've tried playing online, although as usual connection is crap between BayanDSL and PLDT players, and the majority of Pinoy players seem to be on PLDT. Surprisingly, my brother was getting good connection ratings for opponents from Japan! The matching features are okay, despite not having double-blind character selection (this more accurately reflects the arcade experience though!) One thing that seems neat although we haven't tried it yet -- when playing in arcade mode you can allow other online players to challenge you at any time, just like a real arcade game!\r\n\r\nOne last thing: Cammy's ultra is pretty sw33t.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.metacritic.com/games/platforms/ps3/streetfighter4?q=street%20fighter%20iv\r",

And while I found the story decent enough, I wasn't sure whether to like it or hate it. Undoubtedly it was an important point in the history of \"superhero\" comics, but I was never entirely sure about it's point.\r\n\r\nSo of course I saw the movie, and it had remained roughly 85-90% loyal to the source material, which made it a bit boring for me since I generally knew what was going to happen most of the time (except for you know, that thing about the bad guy's master plan... ). Not only does the story remain true to the comic-book style, but the backgrounds and choice of music seemed oddly appropriate for all the flashbacks going on to explain the Watchmen and Minutemen backstories. And the movie leaves me feeling the same way the comic did... ambivalent as it were, and unsure of what deep, thought-provoking message about human existence the Watchmen story was really trying to convey.\r\n\r\nStill, if you're any sort of comic book fan, you should watch it even if you hadn't read the source material. The only real problem with the movie is that Dr. Manhattan seriously needs to wear more pants.",

it was not my night to win a top 8 extended art Mutavault or even one of an undetermined number of Bramblewood Paragons. This tournament report's going to be short.\r\n\r\nRound 1 2-1 win vs 5cc (mirror)\r\n\r\nRound 2 0-2 loss vs B/W tokens\r\n\r\nRound 3 2-1 win vs Monored\r\n\r\nRound 4 1-2 loss vs RGWb Planeswalker Ramp\r\n\r\nRound 5 0-2 loss vs UB Faeries\r\n\r\nI probably punted the BW match, since this was only my 2nd time playing that particular matchup. But for the planeswalkers and faeries losses I felt particularly helpless. The 5cc deck is really just soft against planeswalkers, and this deck even had Fulminator Mage to make things difficult. I can't really counter everything; I just pretend I can. The Faeries battle was mostly one-sided, I was on the defensive the whole game and never managed to recover.\r\n\r\nThat's it for five-color control for me then (no, I'm not selling the Reflecting Pools. Why give up on the archetype? Early spoilers for Alara Reborn point to more difficulties ahead for 5cc; I'm leaning towards something aggro again. Well, of course it still depends on how the metagame evolves, I might be proven wrong later and 5cc still turns out on top and leave me no choice but to play the best deck.\r\n\r\nThis weekend is the Alara Reborn prerelease, and the upcoming set seems ready to turn standard upside-down, and we have a lot of standard to look forward to: Regionals, Nationals grinders and PTQs for Berlin. Hopefully Alara Reborn brings us an even more fun metagame.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Exotic Orchard\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Volcanic Fallout\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Terror\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Mistbind Clique\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Reliquary Tower\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Mutavault\r\n [7]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bramblewood Paragon\r\n [8]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Fulminator Mage\r",

Since NG had already rented out the space for the prerelease at Galleria, they went ahead and held some constructed events + drafts for people who came, and graciously gave out freebies to those disappointed would-be prereleasers. Kudos to NG for handling the situation well.\r\n\r\nI lent out my 5cc deck for a friend to play, and went SSC drafting instead. I opened a crappy pack and just took removal -- Skeletonize then second pick Executioner's Capsule hoping to go Jund. The black dried up though, so I went Naya instead. I drafted no money, really just building something I could play. The guy to my left drafted like 2 mythic rares, four normal rares lol.\r\n\r\nHere's my draft deck:\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"decklist_wrap\"\r\n  <!--\r\n\r\n\r\np class='switcher' class=\"hide\"a href='#' class='hide'Hide Decklist/aa href='#' class='show'Show Decklist/a/p\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n--/p \r\n  \r\n  div class=\"decklist\"\r\n    ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n      li class=\"header\"\r\n        Creatures\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Druid of the Anima\"Druid of the Anima/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Nacatl Outlander\"Nacatl Outlander/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rip-Clan Crasher\"Rip-Clan Crasher/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Steward of Valeron\"Steward of Valeron/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Naya Battlemage\"Naya Battlemage/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Ember Weaver\"Ember Weaver/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Saccellum Archers\"Saccellum Archers/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Knotvine Mystic\"Knotvine Mystic/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Canyon Minotaur\"Canyon Minotaur/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bloodpyre Elemental\"Bloodpyre Elemental/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Welkin Guide\"Welkin Guide/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rakeclaw Gargantuan\"Rakeclaw Gargantuan/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Cavern Thoctar\"Cavern Thoctar/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bull Cerodon\"Bull Cerodon/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Jungle Weaver\"Jungle Weaver/a\r\n      /li\r\n    /ul\r\n    \r\n    ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n      li class=\"header\"\r\n        Spells\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Executioner's Capsule\"Executioner's Capsule/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Fiery Fall\"Fiery Fall/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sigil Blessing\"Sigil Blessing/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Excommunicate\"Excommunicate/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Resounding Silence\"Resounding Silence/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Skeletonize\"Skeletonize/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Obelisk of Jund\"Obelisk of Jund/a\r\n      /li\r\n    /ul\r\n    \r\n    ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n      li class=\"header\"\r\n        Lands\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Naya Panorama\"Naya Panorama/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        3 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Plains\"Plains/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        6 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Mountain\"Mountain/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        6 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Forest\"Forest/a\r\n      /li\r\n    /ul\r\n    \r\n    ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n      li class=\"header\"\r\n        Relevant Sideboard Cards\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Molten Frame\"Molten Frame/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scattershot Archers\"Scattershot Archers/a\r\n      /li\r\n    /ul\r\n    \r\n    div style=\"clear:both\"\r\n    /div\r\n  /div\r\n/div\r\n\r\nFirst round I was up against the deck with a lot of rares.

I won 2-0 as well.\r\n\r\nWent 3-0, never losing a game. Hooray!

I made some minor modifications: Maindeck -1 Plumeveil +1 Mulldrifter, Sideboard -1 Mulldrifter +1 Scourglass. \r\n\r\nThe aggro matchup seemed very solid already so I felt I could afford to lose the fourth Plumeveil. The fourth Mulldrifter would have been a land if I had any Exotic Orchard. \r\n\r\nThe tournament was small (barely twenty people), since the TO had split the usual Saturday tournament into one flight for people who arrived on time, and one flight for people who arrived late. Despite the small number of people, it still went to six rounds, with only the top four getting prizes.\r\n\r\nMy first two rounds went like this:\r\n\r\n  Round 1 0-2 loss vs R/G/W Planeswalkers\r\n  Round 2 1-2 loss vs Faeries\r\n\r\nVery disheartening, but I didn't drop because I really wanted to get in more practice games. Besides, if I won the last 4 matches, I could still make top 4.\r\n\r\n  Round 3 2-0 win vs B/W Reanimator\r\n  Round 4 2-1 win vs R/W Reveillark\r\n  Round 5 2-1 win vs R/W Reveillark\r\n  Round 6 2-1 win vs 5-color control (mirror)\r\n\r\nI punted the first game of the last round, because we were basically just laying down lands and drawing cards and I thought I was pretty safe until he Banefire'd me for 16 damage. Then he got manascrewed in the second and third game, so somehow I lucksacked my way into 3rd place and winning some packs with (mostly) crappy rares.\r\n\r\nI think I'm good to go with 5cc for City Champs in two weeks, though I'm still very uncertain about the B/W Tokens matchup, and not sure if the additional Scourglass I put in will be enough. R/W Reveillark seems to be favorable, while the mirror match is also decent for me since I have built-in planeswalkers to win the long game. Faeries is around 50-50, I have to draw an aggressively defensive hand and keep them off Mistbind Cliques to win.\r\n\r\nMy prize packs had: Telemin Performance (foil), Master Transmuter, Blood Tyrant, Soul's Majesty, Worldheart Phoenix. Bah, I want Banefires or Exotic Orchards!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/magic/2009/03/standard-mar-28/\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Plumeveil\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Mulldrifter\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scourglass\r",

was doing well in between-rounds testing against decks that eventually went 3-1 and 4-0, however I did not fare so well in the actual games that count. \r\n\r\nRound 1: 0-2 loss; first game I stabilized but then Enigma Sphinx blows me out. Second game is a mulligan to four.\r\n\r\nRound 2: BYE. How frustrating; since this is the prerelease and I want to play, I'd rather lose a game than get a bye. Yay, free pack though.\r\n\r\nRound 3: 1-2 loss; I won the 2nd game because he started the first few turns with 3 borderposts that I just hit with Pride-Mage into O-Ring into Maelstrom Pulse. I lost the first game because I didn't draw white; I lost the 3rd game because I didn't draw black.\r\n\r\nRound 4: 2-1 win; good thing I had the Pride-mages to keep Behemoth Sledge in check, that card is a house.\r\n\r\nPretty terrible performance on my end, but I still had fun especially with the in-between games. Building a sealed deck in Alara block is hard, you're probably going to lose at least one round to bad mana if you don't watch what you're doing. Having 80% of your deck be multicolor changes the math significantly, I'm thinking of writing an article about how to distribute your mana, if only so that I understand it better myself.\r\n\r\nNext week: Release party!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Enigma Sphinx\r",

For a while I thought about heading to Baguio for the King of the North tournament, but the fact is I have no standard deck ready at the moment. Besides, I wanted to practice sealed deckbuilding for the upcoming Bangkok GPTs, so this morning I was sleeving up a 40-card deck at Robinson's Galleria.\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"decklist_wrap\"\r\n

conservative with the colors. I resisted the urge to go for the additional removal offered by red and Terminate. Lord of Extinction and Behemoth Sledge were very tempting though, since they're outright bombs.\r\n\r\nMy only two-drops were 2 Grixis Grimblade; based on some of my math analysis during the past week I would need at least 6-7 of each mana source for a 2-color card to have a 70% chance of being able to cast it on turns 2-3, so I went with 6 islands, 5 swamp and the borderpost. Between the Jungle Shrine, the Obelisk of Bant and the Wildfield Borderpost, I figured I had enough green sources to support the 2-card splash, especially since both cards don't need to be played early. I put in plains for the remainder of the lands and felt quite satisfied with the mana.\r\n\r\nRound 1\r\n\r\nI open with Grixis Grimblade into Grixis Grimblade. I see Spellbreaker Behemoth and Madrush Cyclops but I have removal and the Grimblades go all the way. Second game went even faster.\r\n\r\n2-0 games, 1-0 rounds\r\n\r\nRound 2\r\n\r\nGame one I take an early lead and lay down Scourglass for security. He shows me Karthus, Tyrant of Jund taking me to six. During my upkeep, I wipe with the Scourglass then lay down Lord of Extinction and Master of Etherium to go for the kill next turn. He untaps and shows me Vengeful Rebirth and we're shuffling for game two.\r\n\r\nGame two I have a 12/12 Lord of Extinction and he eventually runs out of chump blockers.\r\n\r\nGame three, we're trading on board, but I get a slight advantage with Shieldmages and he's down to seven. I have Cloudhearth Drake and Glassdust Hulk. Eventually I go Lord of Extinction into Sharuum the Hegemon bringing back Ethersworn Shieldmage, then declare combat. He thinks about hitting the Drake with Intimidation Bolt but realizes the Shieldmage protects the Drake so he tells me to swing and moves to block... \r\n\r\n... but I point out the Glassdust Hulk is 5/6 and unblockable due to Sharuum. He can't block either the Hulk nor the Drake so I take the win.\r\n\r\n4-1 games, 2-0 rounds\r\n\r\nRound 3\r\n\r\nHis deck is quick and aggressive, and we exchange close games one and two. However, in game three he curves out with Goblin Deathraiders into Hissing Iguanar into Sewn-Eye Drake. I put up some token resistance but in the end may hand was just too slow.\r\n\r\n5-3 games, 2-1 rounds\r\n\r\nRound 4\r\n\r\nFirst game was Glassdust Hulk into Behemoth Sledge ftw!\r\n\r\nSecond game was Grixis Grimblade into Grixis Grimblade into Tower Gargoyle into Behemoth Sledge for another quick win.\r\n\r\n7-3 games, 3-1 rounds\r\n\r\nDidn't get the 4-0, but still in terms of deck building this one was a lot better than what I did with the prerelease sealed pool. I'm thinking more clearly in terms of how to allocate the mana and how I'm going to play the early drops.\r\n\r\nNext week is constructed (Regionals), but I don't have any deck lined up yet and will most likely cook something up the day before. I'll probably be playing something simple, aggro, red or all of the above. We'll see next week.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Terminate\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lord of Extinction\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Behemoth Sledge\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Grixis Grimblade\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Jungle Shrine\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Obelisk of Bant\r\n [7]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wildfield Borderpost\r\n [8]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spellbreaker Behemoth\r\n [9]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Madrush Cyclops\r\n [10]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scourglass\r\n [11]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Karthus, Tyrant of Jund\r\n [12]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Master of Etherium\r\n [13]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Vengeful Rebirth\r\n [14]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Cloudhearth Drake\r\n [15]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Glassdust Hulk\r\n [16]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sharuum the Hegemon\r\n [17]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Ethersworn Shieldmage\r\n [18]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Intimidation Bolt\r\n [19]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Goblin Deathraiders\r\n [20]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Hissing Iguanar\r\n [21]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sewn-Eye Drake\r",

Given the cards available, I could easily assemble RDW/Blightning or Chapin's 5-Color Blood. But in the end, I gave in to the hype surrounding Tommy Ashton's PTQ-winning decklist, Bant with Finest Hour:\r\n\r\nHowever, due to card availability issues, I didn't have any Dauntless Escorts and only 1 Noble Hierarch. I moved cards around and tried to fit in Vendillion Clique, which would serve as an additional evasive attacker on top of Shorecrasher Mimic and Jhessian Infiltrator, plus a little extra disruption. The decklist I turned in on Sunday for Regionals:\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"decklist_wrap\"\r\n  <!--\r\n\r\np class='switcher' class=\"hide\"a href='#' class='hide'Hide Decklist/aa href='#' class='show'Show Decklist/a/p\r\n\r\n--/p \r\n  \r\n  div class=\"decklist\"\r\n    ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n      li class=\"header\"\r\n        Lands (24)\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Treetop Village\"Treetop Village/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        3 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Seaside Citadel\"Seaside Citadel/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        3 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Yavimaya Coast\"Yavimaya Coast/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Brushland\"Brushland/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Adarkar Wastes\"Adarkar Wastes/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wooded Bastion\"Wooded Bastion/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Mystic Gate\"Mystic Gate/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Flooded Grove\"Flooded Grove/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Reflecting Pool\"Reflecting Pool/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Forest\"Forest/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Island\"Island/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Plains\"Plains/a\r\n      /li\r\n    /ul\r\n    \r\n    ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n      li class=\"header\"\r\n        Creatures (26)\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Birds of Paradise\"Birds of Paradise/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Noble Hierarch\"Noble Hierarch/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Shorecrasher Mimic\"Shorecrasher Mimic/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Jhessian Infiltrator\"Jhessian Infiltrator/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Gaddock Teeg\"Gaddock Teeg/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        3 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Vendillion Clique\"Vendillion Clique/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rhox War Monk\"Rhox War Monk/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rafiq of the Many\"Rafiq of the Many/a\r\n      /li\r\n    /ul\r\n    \r\n    ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n      li class=\"header\"\r\n        Spells (10)\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Negate\"Negate/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bant Charm\"Bant Charm/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Elspeth, Knight-Errant\"Elspeth, Knight-Errant/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        3 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Finest Hour\"Finest Hour/a\r\n      /li\r\n    /ul\r\n    \r\n    ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n      li class=\"header\"\r\n        Sideboard\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        4 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Kitchen Finks\"Kitchen Finks/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        3 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Burrenton Forge-Tender\"Burrenton Forge-Tender/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sower of Temptation\"Sower of Temptation/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Negate\"Negate/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Windborn Muse\"Windborn Muse/a\r\n      /li\r\n      li\r\n        2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Oversoul of Dusk\"Oversoul of Dusk/a\r\n      /li\r\n    /ul\r\n    \r\n    div style=\"clear:both\"\r\n    /div\r\n  /div\r\n/div\r\n\r\nHere's the quick tournament report:\r\n\r\n  Round 1 2-0 vs Sanity Grinding\r\n  Round 2 0-2 vs 5-color Bloodbraid\r\n  Round 3 2-1 vs Blightning\r\n  Round 4 2-0 vs Bant\r\n  Round 5 2-1 vs Boat Brew\r\n  Round 6 2-1 vs GW No Tokens\r\n  Round 7 2-1 vs Finest Hour (Mirror Match!)\r\n  Round 8 2-1 vs Kithkin with Zealous Persecution\r\n\r\n7-1! 2nd after Swiss!\r\n\r\nThe deck plays a lot like fish/merfolk, looking for fast explosive starts and protecting it with light countermagic. Basically you want to lead with an evasive attacker (Shorecrasher Mimic, Jhessian Infiltrator or Vendillion Clique) and follow up with a card to turn it into massive damage (Rafiq of the Many, Finest Hour or Elspeth, Knight-Errant), protecting the aggro with Negate or Bant Chamr.\r\n\r\nWhen I lost to the 5-color blood deck (that eventually won one of the four invites... ), I felt like I was playing so badly because I was unsure of how the matchup should be played. I didn't even board in Forge-Tender! I made a lot of gameplay errors throughout the tournament, so it's basically a miracle that I still made top eight anyway. Part of it was probably because a lot of people weren't really familiar with the card itself, Finest Hour:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome things to note about this card:\r\n\r\n  During the extra combat step, exalted will trigger again, meaning a Rhox War Monk is 4/5 on the first swing and 5/6 on the second. I won the decider match against Kithkin because he thought my Vendillion Clique would be swinging for eight instead of nine.\r\n\r\n  Multiple copies of the card will trigger multiple times. In game 3 of the mirror match my opponent was at five life and had a Lorescale Coatl and a Jhessian Infiltrator in play. I had Rhox War Monk and Finest Hour, then tapped out for the 2nd Finest Hour and swing, telling him I'm getting 3 combat steps so his two blockers weren't enough. He's not sure I'm right so we call a judge. \r\n\r\nThe head judge comes over and we explain the question. He picks up Finest Hour and reads it. Then he picks up the second Finest Hour and reads it. It's the same card man!\r\n\r\nHe rules that I'm correct that I'm getting 2 extra combat steps, and my opponent scoops. I later found out that while the ruling was correct, there was some missing information. Reading the card carefully, you'd see that while I would get 2 additional combat steps, I would only get to untap the Rhox War Monk during the first combat step!\r\n\r\nPlayoffs for nationals slot: 0-2 vs GB Warrior Elves. Boo!\r\n\r\nI managed to stabilize in the first game at around 9 life by using Cliques to trade with Wren's Run Vanquishers, and eventually we went into topdeck mode with me having a War Monk and a coupl of other creatures, unfortunately he had both an Imperious Perfect and a Bramblewood Paragon then drew into Necrogenesis. He didn't have many tokens yet, so I really just needed to draw either Rafiq or Elspeth so that my War Monk could put me ahead. But we just kept drawing lands and his token generators gave him enough creature advantage to push for the win.\r\n\r\nI will say right now that I basically threw away the 2nd game of the playoff match, wasting my best Swiss constructed performance in like, forever. My opening seven in the 2nd game was Brushland, BoP, Noble Hierarch, 2 Rhox War Monk, Sower of Temptation, and a Vendillion Clique. I felt really good about the war monks and the sower since I felt that stealing a Wren's Run Vanquisher or Chameleon Colossus would be key to winning the matchup. I instinctively kept and almost immediately regretted it when the BoP died to Nameless Inversion when I missed the 2nd land drop.\r\n\r\nIn terms of what I'd change in the deck, I'd remove Gaddock Teeg, he was pretty useless. I'm thinking about Murkfiend Liege for that slot since it's another card that makes Shorecrasher Mimic explosive while also providing a decent effect. Oversoul of Dusk I boarded in only for Blightning but never got to play it. The slot could probably be better used for spot removal (i.e. Path to Exile)\r\n\r\nIt's too bad that I missed the slot, but still it was a pretty good performance considering I had basically assembled the deck over a one-day period and had no playtesting at all. Hopefully this will jack up my constructed rating by a lot so that I could still make it in on rating by putting in solid finished in the coming GPTs.\r\n\r\nNext week: Limited again!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/twtw/38\r\n [2]: http://sales.starcitygames.com//deckdatabase/displaydeck.php?DeckID=28398\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Dauntless Escort\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Noble Hierarch\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Vendillion Clique\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Shorecrasher Mimic\r\n [7]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Jhessian Infiltrator\r\n [8]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rafiq of the Many\r\n [9]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Finest Hour\r\n [10]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Elspeth, Knight-Errant\r\n [11]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Negate\r\n [12]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bant Chamr\r\n [13]: http://magiccards.info/scans/en/arb/126.jpg\r\n [14]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lorescale Coatl\r\n [15]: http://spiralmtg.blogspot.com/2009/05/battle-axe-elves-in-regionals-top-four.html\r\n [16]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wren's Run Vanquishers\r\n [17]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Imperious Perfect\r\n [18]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bramblewood Paragon\r\n [19]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Necrogenesis\r\n [20]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Wren's Run Vanquisher\r\n [21]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Chameleon Colossus\r\n [22]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Nameless Inversion\r\n [23]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Murkfiend Liege\r\n [24]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Oversoul of Dusk\r\n [25]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Blightning\r\n [26]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Path to Exile\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Alex on 2009-05-19 02:17:39 +0000\r\nRoy, your opening seven only mentioned 6 cards.

Unfortunately, your opponent had a spot removal.\r\n\r\nAny summary of the first game of the Top8 match?\r\n\r\nComment by roy on 2009-05-19 06:32:50 +0000\r\nEdited.\r\n\r\n Comment by Jagard on 2009-06-08 11:20:44 +0000\r\nHe rules that I'm correct that I'm getting b2 extra combat steps/b, and my opponent scoops. I later found out that while the ruling was correct, there was some missing information. Reading the card carefully, you'd see that while I would get 2 additional combat steps, I would only get to untap the Rhox War Monk during the first combat step!\r\n\r\n&#8212;- I play Finest Hour too. However, I'm unsure about the judge's ruling about this. The same situation happened to me last Friday. However, the judge ruled that we only get 1 extra combat step considering that \"it's the first combat phase of the turn\" as stated on the card. Oh well, off to the forums and FAQ's for me... \r\n\r\nComment by roy on 2009-06-08 23:59:15 +0000\r\nIt's correct, the 2 Finest Hours will both trigger in the first combat phase of the turn, when they resolve it will still be the first combat step, and they'll each give you one extra combat step. \r\n\r\nThe only caveat is that you only get to untap a creature at the time the triggers resolve, which is during the first combat step.\r\n\r\n Comment by Jagard on 2009-06-09 04:15:53 +0000\r\nOh okay, I'll ask just to make sure. I was resigned to the fact that I only get one. Even the FAQ supports this. But you have a point. There's a period after the untap clause, meaning the extra combat step resolves independently of the \"if\" condition.",

We played 1 sealed and 2 drafts; I personally played in the equivalent of around 10 rounds of limited, and my observations are:\r\n\r\n  Number of times damage on the stack came up relevant: None\r\n  Number of times there was a double-blocking situation: One, but we forgot to order blockers and I just immediately used a trick to get rid of one blocker.\r\n\r\nAmong our group, 50% are actively playing competitively, so we can't say that we were making bad strategic decisions, but really rule change #5 practically never came up. \r\n\r\n(We also opened zero planeswalkers, only 1 Maelstrom Pulse and 1 Noble Hierarch et cetera. Not so good returns from the boxen in terms of cash cards... )\r\n\r\n [1]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Maelstrom Pulse\r",

So yesterday (Monday), the whole building was running on generators without air conditioning. Last night, we were notified that the power was back in the building, but just in case, we should come in to work in casual clothes (\"dress down\"), normally reserved for casual Fridays/Saturdays.\r\n\r\nNow, this got me thinking: what's the rationale here? Do we get to dress down because it might be hot? There was like a week long period during summer that the building air conditioners were 50% malfunctioning; it was pretty hot then too, so that's probably not the reason.\r\n\r\nThe question is: why do we have a regular office dress code (ours is \"smart casual\") and a different dress code on arbitrary days (\"casual Fridays\" or \"when the air conditioning breaks down\" or \"if we have bowling in the afternoon\")?\r\n\r\nActually, why do we have office dress codes at all? The easiest answer to think of is that management wants us to \"look professional\". While I don't necessarily agree with that (especially at my work since we aren't usually meeting with clients or anything that remotely requires being impressive), I will stipulate that there are certain benefits of having everyone in the company wearing a certain level of attire; it can provide a certain sort of ambiance that makes people feel more professional and thus conducive to work.\r\n\r\nHowever, given that, why do we have dress-down days? Does it imply that during those days it's okay to be \"less professional\", or to work less? If not, then why aren't we allowed to dress casually all the time?\r\n\r\nObviously, I would prefer to be allowed to wear whatever I want; wearing comfortable clothes is a lot more conducive to work for me than \"looking professional\". But again, I will stipulate that not everyone may think this way.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think, dear reader? Dress-down days: yay or nay?\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Cecil on 2009-06-23 21:31:02 +0000\r\nYes to dress-down days. Comfort over \"professional look\", more specifically to those jobs without much client interaction, and with very unpredictable long hours. Just nothing too sloppy. 🙂\r\n\r\nComment by Rommel on 2009-06-23 23:40:14 +0000\r\nAfter a few years working with lots of different people, I don't believe in the look better / more professional, get better output. Comfy rules! But of course we gotta look good too, slob look not allowed.\r\n\r\n Comment by Chry on 2009-06-25 00:47:00 +0000\r\nYea for dress-how-you-want days. Some people like to dress up; some down. We should just let people decide how they want to come to work.\r\n\r\nIt's been said that one feels smart if one dresses smart. This probably only works for not-so-intelligent people. 😛\r\n\r\nComment by flash-player on 2009-07-07 22:18:11 +0000\r\nCool!\r\n\r\n Comment by zhen on 2009-08-03 23:24:42 +0000\r\nwhy dress professionally -- to look professional since we do carry the company's name and image.\r\n\r\nwhy have dress down days -- because it's weekend and most likely, people may want to have after work activities that formal clothing will not be appropriate for, and having to carry a 2nd set of clothes is such hassle.\r\n\r\nwhy have dress down day when the elevators broke down -- hell no idea. =D",

How would you build this sealed deck? Post your suggestions in the comments below!\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by switch on 2009-06-10 18:38:07 +0000\r\nSeems like the Naya is good (Naya-based 5c to max Paragon/Reliquary?), but the Jund seems tighter. No real bombs to speak of (don't think Archdemon counts, though Knight is close), just a smattering of mana fixing, but I think you can't ignore the removal in black. Here's my low-end list:\r\n\r\n1 Carrion Thrash\r\n  \r\n1 Court Archers\r\n  \r\n1 Fleshbag Marauder\r\n  \r\n1 Grixis Grimblade\r\n  \r\n1 Jund Battlemage\r\n  \r\n2 Jund Hackblade\r\n  \r\n1 Jund Sojourners\r\n  \r\n1 Marisi's Twinclaws\r\n  \r\n1 Monstrous Carabid\r\n  \r\n2 Naya Hushblade\r\n  \r\n1 Thunder-Thrash Elder\r\n  \r\n1 Topan Ascetic\r\n  \r\n1 Toxic Iguanar\r\n  \r\n1 Vithian Stinger\r\n\r\n1 Absorb Vis\r\n  \r\n1 Armillary Sphere\r\n  \r\n1 Bituminous Blast\r\n  \r\n1 Bone Splinters\r\n  \r\n1 Executioner's Capsule\r\n  \r\n1 Exploding Borders\r\n  \r\n2 Firewild Borderpost\r\n  \r\n1 Gift of the Gargantuan\r\n  \r\n1 Sylvan Bounty\r\n  \r\n1 Yoke of the Damned\r\n\r\n7 Mountain\r\n  \r\n3 Forest\r\n  \r\n4 Swamp\r\n\r\nCritters seem too small to main Fallout, but you can argue to main that against Yoke of the Damned, which hasn't done much for me. Having that many blades makes me think you can aggro, but not too sure.",

A lot of famous Magic people like Randy Beuhler and Zvi Mowshowitz have chimed in with their opinions and in general a lot of forum posters are whining about the most controversial change: the removal of combat damage on the stack.\r\n\r\nI, for one, welcome our new non-damage stacking overlords. One of Magic's strengths has always been that it is a dynamic, ever-changing game, and this is just another step in its' evolution. Sure, it might turn out to be a wrong step in the end, but while it's here we get to adapt to the new way of thinking, discarding strategic options that are no longer viable (pretty sure Mogg Fanatic is still a pretty good card though) and looking for what new strategies come to light as a result of the new rules.\r\n\r\nA couple of friends from Singapore are in town next week and we're planning to draft some Alara block. Most likely I will try to persuade them to play according to M10 rules, so that we can get a feel of how things play out when blockers need to line up.\r\n\r\nObviously, it's a big change, but it's not as big a change as Sixth Edition was, and Magic survived that just fine. We need to trust that Wizards would not unleash such a major change like this without having tested it and determined that the game of Magic would still be fun. Fun, that's what it's all about, ain't it?\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.wizards.com/magic/magazine/article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/feature/42a\r\n [2]: http://thethinkinggamer.com/2009/06/10/threats-to-magic-2.aspx\r\n [3]: http://www.top8magic.com/2009/06/ruined-forever-the-magic-2010-rules-changes-by-zvi-mowshowitz/\r",

Here are my last month and a half's worth of results:\r\n\r\n  May 23/GPT Bangkok #1 (SCR sealed): 0-2 drop\r\n  May 31/GPT Bangkok #2 (SCR sealed): 2-3 drop\r\n  June 6/GPT Bangkok #3 (SCR sealed): 4-2\r\n  June 7/Standard (Bant Finest Hour): 2-3 drop\r\n  June 13/Standard-Nats Qualifier (Bant Finest Hour) 1-2 drop\r\n  June 20/Standard-Nats Qualifier (Bant Finest Hour) 1-2 drop\r\n  June 28/Standard-Nats Qualifier (BG Elves) 0-2 drop\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I decided to switch to BG Elves after a few more tournaments with Bant. Despite the very good regionals performance Bant gave me, the deck always felt far too draw-dependent and I was tired of taking like 7 damage a game from painlands. The last loss on June 20 was particularly painful as I had answers to the opponent's threats but was a at one life with 5 painlands and a basic as my mana sources. =/\r\n\r\nTo be honest after the frustrating series of bad performances I was getting a bit tired of Magic ; I felt myself falling into a pattern of blaming the bad pairings and poor draws and I thought I needed a new perspective with a new deck.\r\n\r\nBG Elves is almost as explosive and a lot more consistent than Bant, so it's a fine choice, despite my poor showing last Sunday. My 2 losses then were very close and lost only due to the pilot's poor playing skills. \r\n\r\nDespite the setback, I felt a fresh new perspective, as I was humbly reminded that despite the bad draws, despite the bad pairings, it still ultimately comes down to how well you play, and that's a factor that's well within my control (or any other Magic player's!)\r\n\r\nI quote from Zac Hill/Pchapin: \"Tight technical play decides more games of Magic than all other factors combined.\"\r\n\r\nWe all fall short, but that shouldn't stop us from striving for the perfect technical play.\r\n\r\nPS\r\n\r\nAnother reason I haven't been posting much recently is that I tend to just give short opinions on Magic stuff such as M10 spoilers over on Twitter or Facebook.

Having a planeswalker is a big deal, so I was already sure the primary would be green. The question was the secondary color. White offered Blinding Mage, Serra Angel, a solid curve of creatures and the fantastic Safe Passage. Black gave us a lot of removal, plus some solid evasive creatures. Red and blue gave us some good cards but seemed a bit shallow, so I was left choosing between black and white.\r\n\r\nIn the end white got the nod for the secondary, with black as tertiary splash for 3 kill spells off one swamp. I really like Safe Passage in this format as it helps defend against random Overruns.\r\n\r\nHere's the list I played:\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"decklist_wrap\"\r\n  table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\"\r\n    tr\r\n      td style=\"vertical-align: top\"\r\n        ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n          li class=\"header\"\r\n            Lands\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Terramorphic Expanse\"Terramorphic Expanse/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            7 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Plains\"Plains/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Swamp\"Swamp/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            8 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Forest\"Forest/a\r\n          /li\r\n        /ul\r\n      /td\r\n      \r\n      td style=\"vertical-align: top\"\r\n        ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n          li class=\"header\"\r\n            Creatures\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Blinding Mage\"Blinding Mage/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Elite Vanguard\"Elite Vanguard/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Serra Angel\"Serra Angel/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Veteran Armorsmith\"Veteran Armorsmith/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Veteran Swordsmith\"Veteran Swordsmith/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=White Knight\"White Knight/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Borderland Ranger\"Borderland Ranger/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Craw Wurm\"Craw Wurm/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Cudgel Troll\"Cudgel Troll/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Deadly Recluse\"Deadly Recluse/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Elvish Visionary\"Elvish Visionary/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Llanowar Elves\"Llanowar Elves/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Runeclaw Bear\"Runeclaw Bear/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Stampeding Rhino\"Stampeding Rhino/a\r\n          /li\r\n        /ul\r\n      /td\r\n      \r\n      td style=\"vertical-align: top\"\r\n        ul class=\"decklist_group\"\r\n          li class=\"header\"\r\n            Spells\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Harm's Way\"Harm's Way/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Safe Passage\"Safe Passage/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Assassinate\"Assassinate/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            2 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Doom Blade\"Doom Blade/a\r\n          /li\r\n          li\r\n            1 a href=\"http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Garruk Wildspeaker\"Garruk Wildspeaker/a\r\n          /li\r\n        /ul\r\n      /td\r\n    /tr\r\n  /table\r\n/div\r\n\r\nYes, I left Divine Verdict in the board. I'm brilliant that way.\r\n\r\nQuick match reports!\r\n\r\nRound 1 vs UW with lotsa fliers and ground stallers. Table 33\r\n\r\nGame 1 I got attacked twice by a Sage Owl and won with 18 life.\r\n\r\nGame 2 I board in Windstorm, and get a 3-for-1 during his attack, but somehow he recovers with 2 Wind Drakes that go all the way.\r\n\r\nGame 3 We had an interesting judge call. I had a 4/4 trampler attacking into a 3/5 Siege Mastodon. I play Harm's Way bouncing 2 damage back to the Mastodon, do I get to assign one trample damage or not? Judge ruled that I did not and that was fine since I wasn't sure. The 1 damage ends up not mattering as I lose to 2 2/2 fliers again. (The judge later told me that after thinking about it he wasn't very sure about the ruling either)\r\n\r\nRound 2 It's a bye! What?\r\n\r\nRound 3\r\n\r\nGame 1 we start off both with G/W but then I start playing Doom Blades and take the game.\r\n\r\nGame 2 He suddenly lost his plains and gained swamps. I lost to a Kelinore Bat, how embarrassing. Post-game discussion: Ba't nag-iba ka ng kulay?, Hahaha\r\n\r\nGame 3 Garruk shows up turn four, and from there it's basically 3 for 1's to win the game.\r\n\r\nRound 4\r\n\r\nGame 1 He plays Overrun on turn five with 3 creatures on the board and me at 16. I Doom Blade away a guy and drop to six. On my turn, I play another removal spell and a blocker, and he's out of gas from there.\r\n\r\nGame 2 I board in a 2/3 forestwalker that never gets answered and it takes the game.\r\n\r\nRound 5\r\n\r\nI don't remember much, but I took the win in 3 games. In one game he played turn four Whispersilk Cloak and turn 5 Ant Queen Yikes! Luckily I drew the Borderland Ranger who got the swamp for the Doom Blade before he got equip that thing.\r\n\r\nRound 6\r\n\r\nSuch a close 3 game match. His deck had Overrun, Fireball, 2 Prodigal Pyromancers, Dragon Whelp, Howl of the Night Pack, et cetera. I had to board in more removal, including Weakness of all things. In game three I kept a hand with 5 lands and Garruk, and just won with infi beast tokens.\r\n\r\nRound 7 Intentional Draw\r\n\r\nWoo! 5-1-1 is good enough for top 8, which means I get to draft!\r\n\r\nPack 1, pick 1: Baneslayer Angel. I never really looked at the rest of the pack!\r\n\r\nPack 3, pick 1: I chose Armored Ascension over Sunpetal Grove. Heh, not a raredrafter. Ended up not using the aura though. =/\r\n\r\nI think I passed too many evasive guys. My draft deck ended up U/W, ground stall + fliers with light permission.\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"decklist_wrap\"\r\n  table width=\"100%\" border=\"1\"\r\n    tr\r\n      td style=\"vertical-align:

cetera.\r\n\r\nThe only relevant match was against the semis where the other guy was playing Blue Black.\r\n\r\nSemifinals\r\n\r\nGame 1 I start with Soul Warden He starts with turn 2 Sage Owl and turn 3 Hypnotic Spectre. I play Ice Cage and follow-up with Griffin Sentinel. From there we start racing; he has a numerical advantage but my Warden gains me in the neighborhood of 12 life. I bring him to one but forgot to counter a crucial Phantom Warrior that meant I would not survive the next turn.\r\n\r\nGame 2 He plays 2nd turn Sage Owl. It seems he's sided in Alluring Sirens which makes a bunch of my Illusionary Servants pretty bad. Somehow I manage to counter the relevant spells and run him out of gas to steal the win.\r\n\r\nGame 3 He plays 2nd turn Sage Owl. I joke about asking for a deck check on those Owls. I'm losing badly, stalling at four lands. I'm at five life and about to die the next turn when I draw my fifth land. \"You have one card in hand right?\" I ask him. Hoping he has no removal left, I play the Baneslayer Angel. He draws no Doom Blades or Tendrils and the angel is impossible to race with, so I take the game from there.\r\n\r\nAlthough the draft and the actual quarters match was more luck than skill, a win's a win, so I posted on Twitter as soon as I got home.\r\n\r\n19 days remain until Grand Prix Bangkok... \r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.wizards.com/magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtgcom/grandprix/bangkok09\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Blinding Mage\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Serra Angel\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Safe Passage\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Overrun\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Divine Verdict\r\n [7]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Siege Mastodon\r\n [8]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Harm's Way\r\n [9]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Kelinore Bat\r\n [10]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Doom Blade\r\n [11]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Whispersilk Cloak\r\n [12]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Ant Queen\r\n [13]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Borderland Ranger\r\n [14]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Fireball\r\n [15]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Prodigal Pyromancers\r\n [16]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Dragon Whelp\r\n [17]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Howl of the Night Pack\r\n [18]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Weakness\r\n [19]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Baneslayer Angel\r\n [20]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Armored Ascension\r\n [21]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sunpetal Grove\r\n [22]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Soul Warden\r\n [23]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sage Owl\r\n [24]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Hypnotic Spectre\r\n [25]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Ice Cage\r\n [26]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Griffin Sentinel\r\n [27]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Phantom Warrior\r\n [28]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Alluring Sirens\r\n [29]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Illusionary Servant\r\n [30]: http://twitter.com/roytang/status/3086843964\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Aleks on 2009-08-03 23:22:57 +0000\r\nCongrats (again)!\r\n\r\nBut I think the judge was correct. Resolution of Harm's Way's effect would only occur after combat damage assignment right? So during assignment, you cannot assign trample damage since there's not enough damage for it to be lethal.\r\n\r\nComment by Dee Barizo on 2009-08-04 00:46:43 +0000\r\nCongrats on the win 🙂\r\n\r\nI thought about how I would build your sealed deck before I looked at your actual build. My build was very close to yours -- just off by two cards. I would've gone -1 Assassinate, -1 Runeclaw Bear, +1 Rampant Growth, and +1 Divine Verdict. I like going with consistency over power especially if my deck is already pretty good.\r\n\r\nAlso, in your draft, I'm surprised you didn't play Armorer Ascension, Gorgon Flail, and Magebane Armor. Those three cards seem better that Cancel, Negate, and Whispersilk Cloak.\r\n\r\nAnyways, good luck at the Grand Prix!\r\n\r\n Comment by roy on 2009-08-04 08:10:45 +0000\r\n@Dee I only had 14 creatures, I didn't want to be stuck with too many cards that relied on having creatures in play. Cancel and Negate were pretty good for me in the actual games. Since my opponent turned out to have ground stall guys (Wall of Frost, etc) also, Magebane Armor would have been pretty bad. \r\n\r\nWhisperslik Cloak is by far the best of those 3 equipment, since a cloak on a baneslayer angel is basically game.\r\n\r\nThanks for the comment!",

Has it really been thirty-one years now?\r\n\r\nI have a lot to be thankful for the past thirty-one years. Family, friends and other wonderful people that provide love and support; a roof over my head, three square meals a day minimum and a nice, stable and well-paying job. For all of these, I am thankful.\r\n\r\nOne would think that at such a point in my life, I would be very satisfied for having been so blessed.\r\n\r\nI was never one for being so easily satisfied.\r\n\r\nI remember when I was in high school, I made a bet with a classmate that I would be able to become president of the country before he could. Our wager was worth one cubic meter of solid gold.\r\n\r\nA few years back, I made a wager with an officemate who was about to leave my company to go independent; I bet that I would become famous before he would. To win the bet, one would have to be named person of the year by a major international publication such as Time or Newsweek.\r\n\r\nI'm still a dreamer, I always have been. Since I was young I've dreamed of accomplishing something great. I think everybody has a dreamer inside them, especially when they're young. But as we grow older and face the different trials and tribulations of life, they start to chip away slowly at our dreams. Everyday we make some simple decision that trades a part of those dreams for something pragmatic.\r\n\r\nBut dreams have a way of being overtaken by real life.\r\n\r\nWe tell ourselves we'd just be working for a year or so, until we figure out what direction I wanted my life to take. We have so many options in this day and age; never has the barrier for entry into freelancing, entrepreneurship or innovation been so low. One year passes, then another and then yet another. But we still don't know where we want to go.\r\n\r\nWe say to ourselves; it's okay, I can work on my dreams in my spare time. I'll write a chapter a day. I'll code a few portions of my revolutionary web service after I get home. I'll do design work on my game on weekends. I'll brainstorm business ideas on the way to work. But when we come home from our daily grind, we're dead tired and just want to relax, or surf the web, or play games on our consoles. I'll start tomorrow, a familiar mantra. And days turn into weeks and turn into months and into years.\r\n\r\nI need to get some experience first. I just need to save up some more money. I'm already doing pretty well, why ruin it? I'm pretty lucky to have a well-paying job in this economy, I'd be foolish to take risks now. I have bills to pay. These are the lies we tell ourselves when we find ourselves wondering what happened to our dreams, when we wake up to find ourselves trapped in the loop of ordinary life.\r\n\r\nAnd we end our days, humble and simple, having lived an ordinary life. Just another statistic in human history, just another cog in the great wheel of destiny. And we tell ourselves more lies. I could've been great. I never had any opportunities. If only I had gotten a break.\r\n\r\nFor many people, this ordinary life may be enough, and that's great for them. They will live out their ordinary lives with their ordinary ending and grow old and raise their kids and enjoy the company of their grandchildren and they'll be completely happy and satisfied with that.\r\n\r\nAgain, I was never one for being so easily satisfied.\r\n\r\nThirty-one years now. Days flying by at an unforgiving pace. How will I find myself spending the next thirty-one?\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Ryan Tani on 2009-08-10 19:58:27 +0000\r\nInspiring. I'm in a similar emo mode right now as my 27th birthday approaches. I, too, am nowhere near reaching my dreams, but I guess that's as it should be. We all forget that where we are now used to be a dream; we just make up new ones all the time. \r\n\r\nAnyway belated happy birthday! I'm sure you will be insanely successful one day, as people who have the initials RT always do 😉",

Luckily, that meant I get to play in the Zendikar prerelease.\r\n\r\nMy Zendikar prerelease record: 1-3 =/ I had a decent pool and went with a UW build, but I played too loosely and the stars just weren't aligned. My pool was very bad value-wise as well, having mostly \"nice\" rares like Lullmage Mentor and Lorthos, the Tidemaker. \r\n\r\nMy sealed pool had Blade of the Bloodchief, which I was a bit skeptical about, but it's pretty good in a situation where you're always trading creatures or you have lots of removal. It would probably be lots better in a vampire deck though. The Legendary Octopus was pretty good if you got to untap with it, obviously. I also had Sphinx of Lost Truths but it was never able to save me in time. The \"loot 3\" ability isn't very good when you only have one card in hand, so you better make sure you have a lot of guys to hold the fort while you wait for the seven mana to kick it. Sphinx of Jwar Isle is a lot better.\r\n\r\nI had to face Sorin Markov in one game, and although he costs six, that first ability is a game breaker, especially against my U/W sealed, which had tons of small guys that easily get eaten by his vampire abilities. I lost that game T_T\r\n\r\nI won only one pack (actually I won off a BYE .<), and the pool was so bad, I sold off the pool and the prize pack (contained Bloodghast) so that I could join a booster draft. Nothing else to do anyway!\r\n\r\nI first picked a Verdant Catacombs, but couldn't get heavily into black. I got some late pick Bladetusk Boar and found myself settled into RG. I won the draft on the back of my special ability to mana screw opponents, and thus managed to salvage some prize packs from nowhere. \r\n\r\nAs for Zendikar, I'm still not sure what to make of Zendikar limited. If you get enough cheap allies you can make a blazingly fast deck. The best common ally is in white (Kazandu Blademaster), but I think it's possible to build good curves using any color combination of allies, except possibly black which has no 2 or 3-drop ally. I had the red Ally that makes all your guys FTKs, but he never became relevant, six mana may be too high. \r\n\r\nSpire Barrage was a nice late game finisher, obviously way better than Lava Axe. Red seems ok in Zen limited as there's a lot of common removal Burst Lightning, Inferno Trap, Torch Slinger and of course the aforementioned Spire Barrage.\r\n\r\nSealed is a lot slower than draft as usual; I was watching one sealed game where one guy managed to kick Rite of Replication, but he targeted Shoal Serpent and hoped for the land drop next turn rather than target Kor Hookmaster to win the game on the spot. I wouldn't count on the big kicker spells for draft though, they might be too slow.\r\n\r\nBaloth Cage Trap is pretty good; people like to play their Trusty Machetes and Expedition Maps early so you have a good chance for early beats. I had a Scute Mob, but never had a good chance to play him. Maybe if I had a Vines of Vastwood.\r\n\r\nOkay, enough rambling now. Let's see if I do well in the release events next week.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://whatwouldjtdo.blogspot.com/\r\n [2]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lullmage Mentor\r\n [3]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lorthos, the Tidemaker\r\n [4]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Blade of the Bloodchief\r\n [5]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sphinx of Lost Truths\r\n [6]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sphinx of Jwar Isle\r\n [7]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Sorin Markov\r\n [8]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bloodghast\r\n [9]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Verdant Catacombs\r\n [10]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Bladetusk Boar\r\n [11]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Kazandu Blademaster\r\n [12]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Spire Barrage\r\n [13]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Lava Axe\r\n [14]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Burst Lightning\r\n [15]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Inferno Trap\r\n [16]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Torch Slinger\r\n [17]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Rite of Replication\r\n [18]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Shoal Serpent\r\n [19]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Kor Hookmaster\r\n [20]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Baloth Cage Trap\r\n [21]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Trusty Machete\r\n [22]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Expedition Map\r\n [23]: http://magiccards.info/autocard.php?card=Scute Mob\r",

The rest of the time (around 5-ish hours) was spent on glue logic, fixing minor bugs, working on HTML layout, cleaning up text, etc. It feels pretty good for a one manday effort, let's see if it breaks down. Not the best code I've ever written though (until the latest upload the main class was named \"hello.py\")\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n  \r\n-- the Django template engine included with GAE seems to be earlier than version 1, as the escapejs filter wasn't available and I had to write it myself. Still, being familiar with the Django template engine helped a lot\r\n  \r\n-- WordPress.com blogs don't allow Javascript inside the posts, so the blog sharing code I provide won't work there. It works on Blogger though. I'll look for a workaround... (iframes?)\r\n  \r\n-- I've yet to try using memcache, so the current version doesn't cache anything, I mean to try it in a future version\r\n  \r\n-- yes, I put adsense ads there. I was like, why not? 😀\r\n\r\n [1]: http://appengine.google.com/\r\n [2]: http://mtg-utils.appspot.com/deck/\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Some anonymous person on 2009-10-04 11:26:11 +0000\r\n\"Posted by by roytang on Sat 03 Oct 2009 as a deck for Standard\"",

One of the side projects that's been in my backlog for a long time has been to work on an improved version of the MTGO Draft Converter at zizibaloob. I thought I would get started on that today, and in fact already had quite a bit of javascript done for the draft widget when I read a new post by Brian David-Marshall over on top8magic and found out that there was already a new draft recorder website: RareDraft. I got myself an invite and tried it out, it has many of the features I was planning and more! Ah, now I don't know whether it's worth continuing my own project. =/\r\n\r\nAnyway, here's the link to the unfinished, unrefined (but working!) MtgStorm draft converter. (if you've been following me on twitter, you know that I created a new username \"mtgstorm\" for MTG-related stuff)\r\n\r\nTo see how far ahead RareDraft's offering is, here's a recent Alara block draft I 3-0'd on MTGO.

It was around 10pm, I was getting off the bus carrying a box of ensaymada in my right hand and using my left hand to make my way down the crowded aisle despite the speed and turbulence of the bus ride. As I alighted off the bus, I felt movement in my left pants pocket, where my wallet was. As soon as my left hand was free I checked to find my wallet missing and looked back accusingly at the mass of unfamiliar faces crowded along the door of the bus. One man whose face I couldn't see extended an arm and pointed out into the crowd. There's a man running, he said, that's who you're looking for. I look around like an idiot, and the bus goes on its way. There was no running man, my wallet was lost.\r\n\r\nI later learned from a couple of other people that it was a known modus operandi. Simply, a group of around ten guys rides a crowded bus and they all stand around near the exit, waiting for victims, ones who look distracted and are thus easy prey. This sort of thing seems to happen a lot around Christmas season.\r\n\r\nDespite my anger at myself for being so easily distracted, as soon as I got home I took stock of the wallet contents and took the necessary measures:\r\n\r\nCash: I had around 1.6kphp in my wallet at the time. Can't really do anything about that. Luckily I seldom carry cash larger than that.\r\n\r\nCredit Cards: I had 2 credit cards in the wallet, one was the card I used regularly, and one was a new card a bank sent me unsolicited and I had never used (but I put it in my wallet anyway). I called up the banks to have both cards blocked and to get a replacement card for the one I was using. Damage: 400php replacement fee.\r\n\r\nATM Cards: Originally I was thinking the ATM card wouldn't be of much use to the thieves because of the PIN, but I was convinced to go ahead and cancel it anyway. It turned out to be a good choice as I found out later my bank's ATM card was also a debit card. Damage: 150php replacement fee for the ATM card.\r\n\r\nIDs: My company ID was in the wallet, I would have to get it replaced. Damage: 200php for replacement and getting new ID pictures.\r\n\r\nInsurance Card: My health care insurance card was there also. Damage: 150php replacement fee.\r\n\r\nReceipts: I had a couple of reimbursable (with my company) dinner receipts in the wallet, damage: 400php in lost reimbursements.\r\n\r\nOther papers: I also realized my most recent payslip was in the wallet, which would contain my bank account number. This was dangerous, since given the bank account number, my signature (from the company ID, credit cards) and sufficiently gullible bank personnel, an over-the-counter withdrawal from my bank account might be possible. The next day I spent two hours at the bank opening a new savings account, transferring the remaining balance and asking my company to have the payroll go into the new account. Damage: Two hours of time.\r\n\r\nSo, the total losses were around 2.9k, plus a few hours of hassle. It's not as bad as the last time I was the victim of petty theft, so I'm mostly just annoyed at how I let it happen.\r\n\r\nFuture Prevention and Mitigation Activities:\r\n\r\n  When I know I'm going to be taking any form of mass transit or going to crowded places, I'll carry my wallet and cellphone in my belt bag instead of my pockets. The belt bag is much harder to steal and it's bulkier so it's a lot harder to hide.\r\n  Take pictures of each ID/credit card (front and back) and store those pictures in a safe place, encrypted behind a secure password (i.e. not on Flickr). Having the images makes it easier to have those cards blocked and also makes it easier to remember what stuff you had in the wallet.\r\n  Don't store receipts and payslips in my wallet, especially anything with bank account numbers. I'll probably find a place to store them at work or inside a more secure container in my bag.\r\n  Get additional IDs. I don't have a driver's license yet, but I'll look to get one next year. Having more IDs makes it easier to establish your identity when you need to apply for new accounts or block existing ones.\r\n\r\nHopefully the above story, information and tips help someone avoid any other such misfortune in the future.\r\n\r",

I'll probably post a more detailed analysis later.\r\n\r\nThe RoE limited format is fun and it is slower than Zendikar, but you still need to keep an eye on your curve (even though that curve may now end with 7-8-9-and up instead of 5-6... ). Lots of ground stalls, so guys with evasion are much more valuable.\r\n\r\nI think a good limited deck would revolve around a number of good leveler creatures, as these guys are basically must-kill before they get to the long game. Excellently designed and easy to underrate, you should probably play all the common levelers. Except possibly the common guys that have Level Up 4, they take forever to grow up. Good instant-speed removal is also pretty scarce, and a lot of it is sorcery speed, making levelers pretty good. (Hint: I don't consider {{ card }}Smite{{ /card }} to be \"good\")\r\n\r\nTotem Armor is pretty sweet too, and you need to note that only blue, white and black have common ways to get rid of guys with Totem Armors on. (Blue bounce, {{ card }}Oust{{ /card }}, {{ card }}Induce Despair{{ /card }}). I find {{ card }}Snake Umbra{{ /card }} particularly annoying. I never want to give him extra cards!\r\n\r\nRebound is... well, extra spells are good I guess, and I actually saw someone get like 18 soldiers off {{ card }}Nomads Assembly{{ /card }}, but the rebound cards are so few and far between and a lot of them have marginal effects. As a mechanic, it feels unnecessary and it doesn't seem to fit any of Zendikar's themes even. Maybe it'll be better in constructed? (Only {{ card }}Consuming Vapors{{ /card }} seems promising to me though.)",

Turns out that wouldn't be a problem as there were a bunch of Magic players outside the mall waiting for it to open when I got there. It turns out that the mall had recently changed it's opening hours from 10 AM to 11 AM though, so we all had to wait outside in the heat for an additional hour before we could start the event. =/\r\n\r\nAnnoying mall policies aside, here's my prerelease sealed pool:\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist title=\"Rise of Eldrazi Prerelease Sealed Pool\" }}\r\n[Colorless]\r\n  \r\nHand of Emrakul\r\n  \r\nSkittering Invasion\r\n  \r\nUlamogs Crusher\r\n  \r\n[/Colorless]\r\n  \r\n[White]\r\n  \r\nEland Umbra\r\n  \r\nGuard Duty\r\n  \r\nHyena Umbra\r\n  \r\nIkiral Outrider\r\n  \r\nKabira Vindicator\r\n  \r\nKor Spiritdancer\r\n  \r\nLone Missionary\r\n  \r\nNear-Death Experience\r\n  \r\nOust\r\n  \r\nRepel the Darkness\r\n  \r\nSmite\r\n  \r\n2 Souls Attendants\r\n  \r\nSoulbound Guardians\r\n  \r\nStalwart Shield-Bearers\r\n  \r\n[/White]\r\n  \r\n[Blue]\r\n  \r\n2 Champions Drake\r\n  \r\nFrostwind Invoker\r\n  \r\nJwari Scuttler\r\n  \r\nLay Bare\r\n  \r\nMerfolk Observer\r\n  \r\nNarcolepsy\r\n  \r\nReality Spasm\r\n  \r\nRegress\r\n  \r\nRenegade Doppelganger\r\n  \r\nSee Beyond\r\n  \r\nSkywatcher Adept\r\n  \r\n[/Blue]\r\n  \r\n[Black]\r\n  \r\nBloodrite Invoker\r\n  \r\nBloodthrone Vampire\r\n  \r\nCadaver Imp\r\n  \r\nConsuming Vapors\r\n  \r\nDread Drone\r\n  \r\nEscaped Null\r\n  \r\nGloomhunter\r\n  \r\nInduce Despair\r\n  \r\nLast Kiss\r\n  \r\nNull Champion\r\n  \r\n2 Perish the Thought\r\n  \r\nShrivel\r\n  \r\nSkeletal Wurm\r\n  \r\nSuffer the Past\r\n  \r\n[/Black]\r\n  \r\n[Red]\r\n  \r\nAkoum Boulderfoot\r\n  \r\nBattle Rampart\r\n  \r\nBattle-Rattle Shaman\r\n  \r\nConquering Manticore\r\n  \r\n2 Flame Slash\r\n  \r\nFissure Vent\r\n  \r\nGoblin TUnneler\r\n  \r\nLagac Lizard\r\n  \r\nLord of Shatterskull Pass\r\n  \r\nRapacious One\r\n  \r\nSpawning Breath\r\n  \r\nStaggershock\r\n  \r\nTraitorous Instinct\r\n  \r\nVent Sentinel\r\n  \r\n[/Red]\r\n  \r\n[Green]\r\n  \r\nAncient Stirrings\r\n  \r\nAura Gnarlid\r\n  \r\nGravity Well\r\n  \r\nHaze Frog\r\n  \r\nJaddi Lifestrider\r\n  \r\nJoraga Treespeaker\r\n  \r\nKozileks Predator\r\n  \r\nLiving Destiny\r\n  \r\n2 Naturalize\r\n  \r\nNema Siltlurker\r\n  \r\nOndu Giant\r\n  \r\nOvergrown Battlement\r\n  \r\nPreys Vengeance\r\n  \r\nSnake Umbra\r\n  \r\n2 Stomper Cub\r\n  \r\n[/Green]\r\n  \r\n[Artifact]\r\n  \r\nEnatu Golem\r\n  \r\nOgres Cleaver\r\n  \r\n2 Prophetic Prism\r\n  \r\nSphinx Bone-Wand\r\n  \r\nWarmongers Chariot\r\n  \r\n[/Artifact]\r\n  \r\n[Lands]\r\n  \r\nEvolving Wilds\r\n  \r\n[/Lands]\r\n  \r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\n{{ card }}Lord of Shatterskull Pass{{ /card }} and {{ card }}Conquering Manticore{{ /card }} are pretty much Dragon-class bombs and red had some cheap removal going for it (2 {{ card }}Flame Slash{{ /card }}, etc.), so I figured I'd be playing red.

I have a pair of {{ card }}Souls Attendants{{ /card }} keeping my life pretty high, but he manages to play {{ card }}Pathrazer of Ulamog{{ /card }} with all the Eldrazi Spawn and the big guy just overruns me. I board in a forest and a {{ card }}Naturalize{{ /card }} for the spawn-blossom, but it's irrelevant as he gets the overrun dude early again and ramps to 8 mana easily. 1-1 matches, 2-3 games.\r\n\r\nMy lack of review about the limited format shows up here, as I misread the green invoker and thought it was an overrun effect at common. What was I thinking? Not sure if it would have affected the outcome though, my opponent played the invoker correctly (I don't even think he was aware of my misunderstanding) Still, green ramps up pretty quickly; I could easily see a draft archetype in major green relying on cards like {{ card }}Nest Invader{{ /card }}, {{ card }}Kozileks Predator{{ /card }}, {{ card }}Growth Spasm{{ /card }} and {{ card }}Wildheart Invoker{{ /card }}.\r\n\r\nRound 3 vs U/W/r. Game one he has a slow start, stuck on three lands, while I get a cleaver on a {{ card }}Rapacious One{{ /card }} and start making ridiculous numbers of Eldrazi Spawn and I take the win. But games 2 and 3 he takes easily on the back of common blue and white levelers, {{ card }}Knight of Cliffhaven{{ /card }} and {{ card }}Skywatcher Adept{{ /card }} paired with some {{ card }}Champion's Drakes{{ /card }}. Another possible draft archetype could be based on these UW fliers. 1-2 matches, 3-5 games.\r\n\r\nRound 4 vs G/R/W. He takes a quick game one, but I manage to stall out game two with a 2 {{ card }}Souls Attendants{{ /card }} start. He has a lot of Eldrazi spawn generation going so I gain something like 20 life off of them before I finish the game by getting {{ card }}Lord of Shatterskull Pass{{ /card }} to level 6. We have only around 15 minutes left for game 3, but unfortunately I have to mull to six and start with a two-lander. I don't draw lands for the first 5-6 turns, but stay alive due to cheap removal and drawing the 2 {{ card }}Souls Attendants{{ /card }} again. I finally start drawing lands and claw my way back, eventually managing to play a {{ card }}Conquering Manticore{{ /card }} that can break through the sky and he's unable to answer it. 2-2 matches, 5-6 games.\r\n\r\nI'm disappointed with my performance -- I think this has been my worst prerelease in a while.My 2-2 record wins me only two packs, where I got these not-so-awesome rares:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-40\" title=\"18042010051\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/18042010051-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/18042010051-300x225.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/18042010051-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /\r\n\r\nNext: I'll post more detailed thoughts on RoE limited.\r\n\r",

Let's take a look at the card a href=\"http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/twtw/85\"previewed in this week's /aema href=\"http://www.wizards.com/Magic/Magazine/Article.aspx?x=mtg/daily/twtw/85\"The Week That Was/a/em by Brian David-Marshall, Inquisition of Kozilek:\r\n/pfigure style=\"width: 265px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg title=\"Inquisition of Kozilek\" src=\"http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/tcg/products/riseoftheeldrazi/mmbe7rmg3r_EN.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"265\" height=\"370\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Nobody expected the Kozilek inquisition!/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nBDM of course already pointed out the obvious comparisons to {{ card }}Thoughtseize{{ /card }}, which is the premier pinpoint discard spell at this mana point; {{ card }}Thoughtseize{{ /card }} has the advantage in versatility (can get any card) versus the slight drawback of giving up 2 points of life. That being said, if Inquisition of Kozilek had existed in Standard in place of Thoughtseize, it would still be good enough to take the same place in the one-two-three punch of the good ol' Faerie menace:\r\n\r\nTurn One: Inquisition of Kozilek\r\n\r\nTurn Two: {{ card }}Bitterblossom{{ /card }}\r\n\r\nTurn Three: {{ card }}Jace Beleren{{ /card }}\r\n\r\nWhat did Faeries really want to take on turn one anyway? In the mirror match, you of course wanted to take out the ubiquitous {{ card }}Bitterblossom{{ /card }}; when fighting the other aggro deck of the time, you'd want to pull out a {{ card }}Figure of Destiny{{ /card }}, or at least a {{ card }}Wizened Cenn{{ /card }}; when faced with the opposing five-color control, you'd take away his {{ card }}Negate{{ /card }} or {{ card }}Broken Ambitions{{ /card }} to push through your own &#8216;Blossom on turn two.\r\n\r\nThis is where pinpoint discard is at it's best -- in the early turns, protecting your early plays. In all of these cases, the Inquisition might as well be {{ card }}Thoughtseize{{ /card }}, with the added benefit of keeping your precious two life!\r\n\r\nSure, it's suboptimal as a topdeck in the late game, but so was Thoughtseize! And luckily, it's uncommon this time around, and won't cost you a bundle of cash like Thoughtseize did in it's heyday.\r\n\r\nOf course, you might want to note that unlike the generic-flavored {{ card }}Thoughtseize{{ /card }}, {{ card }}Inquisition of Kozilek{{ /card }} has almost no chance of being reprinted in a future set, unless the Eldrazi make some sort of second coming down the line!\r\n\r\nAside from the hypothetical comparison to {{ card }}Thoughtseize{{ /card }} (in truth, the only relationship those two cards would ever have would be for Inquisition to be Thoughtseize #5-8 in an extended deck that just can't get enough), what of the implications for future standard? Among the existing decks I think the Inquisition can find a home in the current public enemy number one, Jund. Why? To proactively take out the new hindrance, referring of course to {{ card }}Wall of Omens{{ /card }}:figure style=\"width: 265px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg title=\"Wall of Omens\" src=\"http://www.wizards.com/mtg/images/tcg/products/riseoftheeldrazi/rnzzz20znr_EN.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"265\" height=\"370\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Future bane of aggressive decks everywhere!/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nAs I see it, the inquisition is currently the only way to take out the defensive beast without giving the opponent the sweet card advantage he was looking for! Aside from Jund, other black aggressive decks such as Vampires will find a good use for the new pinpoint discarder. And I reckon it's going to play a role in any new black decks that emerge as well. Patrick Chapin(@thepchapin on twitter) referred to {{ card }}Wall of Omens{{ /card }} as among the top 5 cards in the upcoming standard, I'm thinking {{ card }}Inquisition of Kozilek{{ /card }} might be right behind it!\r\n\r",

Here are some other annoyances I encountered (just a quick brain dump):\r\n\r\n  The Comelec BEI and volunteers may be uncoordinated. I went to a waiting room at the first floor and got a number and was told to wait for my batch of 10 to be sent to the voting room at the second floor. After about an hour, we found out the voting room wasn't aware numbers were being given out and had let some people start voting already. We went upstairs flailing like an angry mob and were fortunately given priority.\r\n  People (i.e. idiots) keep trying to get ahead of people who were there before them, adding to the confusion. I was especially annoyed at a bunch of senior citizens who pushed ahead of us in line and saying they should be first because they were almost fainting from the heat. I understand that old people deserve some consideration, but even after they were told that they would be processed after the current people in line (about five people, including me) they still went ahead and basically forced the Comelec people to process them.\r\n  Because there were a lot of idiots trying to get ahead, and of course the people in line being angry about the idiots, the Comelec BEI were quite flustered and themselves frustrated at the situation. They're not used to handling this many people -- I remember during previous elections it would take us twenty minutes tops to get in, fill up the ballot and be done. This time it took me about an hour once I actually got into the voting room.\r\n  As a software engineer, I hate inefficiencies and there were quite a number in their procedures. The \"book\" of voter registration records for each precinct was needed in two queues -- the one for getting the ballot and the one for putting the thumb print and indelible ink. So if you were in one queue and the voter book for your precinct was being used in the other queue... you'd have to wait! It seems they also\r\n  PCOS machine glitches -- happened twice, once before I went into the voting room and once while I was in line to put my ballot in. Apparently the machine only needed to be rebooted.\r\n\r\nOverall it took me around 2 hours, including the stupid waiting period caused by #1. I cast the 26th ballot in my clustered precinct, I'm not sure how it's possible to finish 1,000 voters at this rate.\r\n\r\nDespite all the problems, don't forget to thank the Comelec staff once you're done, they're overworked and underpaid, they could use the boost.\r\n\r\nGood luck to those who have yet to vote, may your experience be smoother than mine.",

The E-VAT thing is actually a plus for him, as it shows he has the capacity to make difficult decisions if needed.\r\n\r\nFor Senators:\r\n\r\nSonia Roco: I believe she will live up to the advocacies espoused by her husband the late Raul Roco (whom I voted for in 2004). Focus: Education.\r\n\r\nRisa Hontiveros: A solid history of advocacy and support for pro-people legislation during her two terms as AKBAYAN party-list representative. Focus: Healthcare, Women's Rights\r\n\r\nNeric Acosta: Former teacher and three-term congressman of Bukidon, with legislative history focusing on environmental concerns. Focus: Environment\r\n\r\nMartin Bautista: A successful doctor in the US, decided to come back to the Philippines to offer to serve the country. Focus: Healthcare, including reproductive health\r\n\r\nAlex Lacson: I have to admit, I'm only voting for him because of his book \"12 Little Things A Pinoy Can Do To Help His Country.\" I'm a sucker for anyone who is able to point out to Filipinos that change has to start with ourselves, even with little things. It's good to have new faces in the Senate instead of just the same old trapos. Focus: education, employment.\r\n\r\nAdel Tamano: Originally I wanted to avoid voting for any NP candidates, given how ticked off I am by MV. But unlike the presidential race which is all-or-nothing, I prefer giving other parties some space in the senatorial race so that the Senate won't be a rubber stamp of the administration. Tamano is a good choice, he's another former educator (was head of the Pamantasan ng Lungsod ng Maynila) and adds representation for Mindanao\r\n\r\nPia Cayetano: The only other NP senator I'm voting for. Her advocacies include health, education, environment, youth and women's empowerment.\r\n\r\nMiriam Santiago: A lot of people don't like Miriam for various reasons (luka-luka, madaldal were some of the reasons people cited), but I'm not the sort of person to dismiss someone just because she doesn't follow social conventions. Miriam has been around a while and doesn't take any BS from anybody. Her presence in the Senate will keep people honest because she likes to call a spade a spade. At the very least, it will keep the Senate interesting. Focus: ???\r\n\r\nI'm stopping at eight senators for now. None of the others particularly appeal to me.\r\n\r\nFor Mayor/Vice Mayor of Quezon City, I'm going with Bautista/Belmonte, mostly because I trust that Sonny Belmonte wouldn't choose idiots to take over after his well-respected term as mayor.\r\n\r\nFor Congressman and District councilors, I'm abstaining. I don't know who the candidates are, and even worse, I'm voting in a different district than where I'm currently residing, I have no right to decide the fate of district 3.\r\n\r\nFor party-list, I choose AGHAM party list (same one I voted for last time). It's sad that they are supporting Villar, but I'll just overlook that since I'm strongly leaning towards their Science and Technology advocacy. S&T; isn't usually a concern of ordinary Filipinos, but that's something that has to change as it's one of the ways we can climb out of where we are now and attempt to become an industrialized country.\r\n\r\nWhew, composing this post took a while. I have to admit some of my choices were rushed (particularly for Senator), as most of my decision-making energy was spent researching the Presidentiables. Although things can still change between now and Monday, this will probably be close to my final ballot.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Chry on 2010-05-08 09:00:21 +0000\r\nWhat is your opinion on straight-ticket voting? You don't think that it would help your president in getting things done or that it would lessen the chances of clashing political agenda?\r\n\r\nComment by Roy on 2010-05-08 11:04:18 +0000\r\nStraight-ticket voting is a lot like block voting -- it's great for the voter who doesn't want to think too hard.\r\n\r\nI'm not inclined to give any one President absolute power; and dominating both the Senate and the House is as close to absolute power as one can legally get within our system.\r\n\r\n Comment by Jaime on 2010-05-08 13:21:31 +0000\r\nWell, what roytang says is true, but you have to realize that that option DOES help get things done. Even in a dictatorship that is focused on enriching / empowering only select individuals, whatever mandate the dictator wills is still expeditiously performed. \r\n\r\nI sincerely believe that the Checks and Balances mechanics of a Democracy are intended to stabilize an already secure country, with change happening only if majority or all sides agree on said change (on the notion that, clearly, it must be for the better for most / all the people, since they all want it). \r\n\r\nI'm inclined to do straight-ticket voting, because I do believe drastic change needs to be done to get the ball rolling. \r\n\r\nBut this will only work for sure at the onset. Politics is politics, and no one stays allied for too long. \r\n\r\nChry, I think what you actually want is then to get are leaders, who, regardless of different political backgrounds, aim for the same platform. Just because they're enemies, doesn't mean that healthcare enthusiasts will not want healthcare related issues solved (though, leaders will always surprise you).\r\n\r\nComment by edebelenmd on 2010-05-15 21:36:14 +0000\r\nHmmm...  so hindi na kita puwede sisihin kung bakit hindi umuunlad ang Pilipinas? 😛\r\n\r\nNice post! Just let me know when SRJT is running for president! 😀",

I'm still actively posting bite-sized snippets of my brain on twitter and I even added a new outlet for random internet nonsense on my tumblr account Easily Distracted but I've been lazily avoiding the elaborate writing of long prose.\r\n\r\nIt's easy to find excuses not to write; for the longest time I was considering switching this blog back to WordPress (I'm currently running a custom Django-based blog engine of my own creation) and changing the theme, et cetera -- the sort of busy work one gets into when avoiding something else.\r\n\r\nHave I been avoiding writing? Maybe I'd fallen into the trap a lot of people fall into -- thinking that I have nothing useful to say, so I better not just say anything. There's something about staring at a blank text box that you need to fill up that triggers a primitive part of our brains that thinks we should avoid pushing out our thoughts or opinions into the world for fear of being questioned or ridiculed. Maybe it's a holdover from the days that elementary school English teachers would force us to write reaction papers and essays with a required number of words or pages. (Few teachers ask for an N-page paper, they know students will just cheat by using double-space or large fonts.)\r\n\r\nI've also been worried about the sort of things that I write; like a lot of bloggers I somehow fell into the mindset that I should limit myself to a specific set of topics such as software development or Philippine politics or whatever. It's a bit ridiculous, this isn't a topical blog, it's a personal website and I can (and should) write about whatever I damn well please.\r\n\r\nSidebar: If you're wondering \"Why write a blog at all?\", try reading \"You should write blogs\" by Steve Yegge.. Looking over his reasons why not to blog, I don't even have the luxury of claiming I don't have enough time, not since I quit my job. (Hmm, I should probably write about that in a future post... )\r\n\r\nSo anyway, let's put this ramble to an end. I'll be writing regularly again for now, probably five times a week. Wish me luck!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://scottberkun.com\r\n [2]: http://twitter.com/roytang\r\n [3]: http://tumblr.roytang.net\r\n [4]: http://sites.google.com/site/steveyegge2/you-should-write-blogs\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Kerwin on 2010-06-07 22:55:52 +0000\r\nI have the same problem.

One of the things I most often get asked when I take an extended break from work is \"Won't you get bored with all that free time?\"\r\n\r\nThis question strikes me as a strange attitude towards free time, as if it were an annoyance to be avoided instead of a resource to be enjoyed. The people who subscribe to this belief are probably the same people who watch TV all the time when at home, or who can't imagine life without having a 9 to 5 job eating up most of their day. Those people need to find a hobby :p\r\n\r\nYou wouldn't ask a billionaire \"Won't you get bored with all that money?\" because you know there are a lot of ways to invest money, grow it or use it. Time is the same thing: a valuable resource that you can simply use in everyday consumption activities like watching TV/movies or you can also choose to invest your time in learning or creation activities that expand your horizons.\r\n\r\nThe difference between time and money is that money is a renewable resource (you can always earn more!), while time used up is never coming back. Therefore, you should value time more than money. There are some people (workaholics) who think that time spent not earning money is wasted time. But in truth, you only need to spend time to earn money enough to provide for your own needs. Beyond that, the money is simply a luxury that you need to weigh alongside the luxury of free time.\r\n\r\nSo do what I do: cherish and enjoy your free time, especially that unprogrammed time that you can spend however you wish, and make sure you spend it only on activities that are worthwhile for you.",

Then I read a blog post today \"Why I Quit A Six Figure Job\" which I found to express/coincide with my thoughts pretty well on the upsides and downsides of having a job.\r\n\r\nWhen I started working in 2003 I was young and inexperienced and had no idea what sort of things should be planned out in life. For the first four years of my stay there I worked hard, the job was awesome, I was working with terrific people, I was learning a lot and the paycheck was great. Somewhere around late 2006 I completed my first largish project as technical lead and I felt we had pulled it off quite well.\r\n\r\nFast forward to three years later (2009). For some reason, it felt like time went by really quickly and the period of rapid growth that I experienced during the first half of my stay had slowed down into a more gradual pace. Though I was still improving and learning new things, it was nowhere near the level as when I first started. I felt like I was pretty much in the same place I was in 2006, in terms of technical skill, responsibilities, etc. (Well, of course my paycheck got better... ).\r\n\r\nThis is the hardest part to explain, at that time I didn't understand it very well myself, but basically there is a trap that anyone working a \"9 to 5\" job easily falls into. That trap is complacency. It's a trap fueled by the easy money of the regular paycheck. By then I would often find myself just phoning it in. Successive days would pass by where I'm just going through the motions of waking up, slogging through the commute, doing whatever needs to be done, sleeping through the bus ride home and hoping the weekend comes sooner. And whenever I tried to look down the line, imagining what the job would be like three or four years later, I couldn't see it being any different than what it was right now.\r\n\r\nI'm sure a lot of people (probably 95% of people or more) would have been perfectly happy where I was with a good job and a steady paycheck. But I'm a greedy bastard, I want more in life than other people are willing to settle for. I felt like if I stayed where I was, somehow the story of my life would be over, as I already knew how the future would go if I stayed.\r\n\r\nSo I forced the change. I resigned from my job and took the leap into an uncertain future. I still don't know where I'm going, and I'm still currently unemployed, but I know I have a lot of options. I don't have any big commitments (not gonna be married anytime soon) and I have enough of a safety net to last me a few years, so I'm in no hurry.\r\n\r\nThis post already went on for longer than I intended, so I'll leave other questions such as \"What are you doing now that you're a bum?\" (I get asked this a lot) or \"Isn't it stupid to quit your job without a plan?\" for future discussions. If you found my reasons interesting though, you may want to read the discussion thread on Hacker News about Xavier Shay's post, it's quite interesting.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://azeus.com\r\n [2]: http://www.two-shay.com/articles/why-i-quit-a-six-figure-job\r\n [3]: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=phone%20it%20in\r",

I always enjoy this sort of thing -- it feeds my tech envy when they describe cool setups or gadgets I don't have. (A lot of them have Macs!)\r\n\r\nI actually purchased a new desktop computer a while back without posting any details, so I thought I'd something similar to The Setup so that I have a record of what I'm using now.\r\n\r\nWhat Hardware Do You Use?\r\n\r\nDesktop -- my desktop is primarily for gaming, is a custom-built setup. Prepackaged and branded desktops aren't really popular here in the Philippines, at least among techies. I actually had my brother put this one together, just gave him the budget and told him to maximize it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecs:\r\n\r\n  2.67 gigahertz Intel Core i5 750, 4GB ram, 1TB HD, ATI Radeon HD 5770 (1GB onboard memory)\r\n  I also have a pair of crappy speakers -- I have to adjust the connector every so often when watching eps because the voice tracks get filtered out for some reason.\r\n  I have never solved that 5&215;5 Rubik's Cube.\r\n\r\nLaptop\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy laptop is an Acer Aspire 4920G that I purchased around 2 years ago. Core2 Duo 1.8GHz, 3gig ram, 160GB HD, ATI Radeon X2500 video card. It's old and not really that portable -- I seldom bring it outside the house, but it's a workhorse and gets the job done. It's my primary machine at home for random internet surfing and coding; I usually have it mounted on a breakfast tray (shown in the picture) so I can use while lying down on the bed. It can also act as a secondary gaming machine in a pinch, although it tends to overheat and crash if I use it for an extended gaming session.\r\n\r\nGaming Console\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt's an 80GB original model PS3 hooked up to a 22&#8243; Samsung HD monitor. We have the Rock Band 2 set provided by chowtimer, plus a couple of arcade fight sticks for Street Fighter IV. There's an SD-only TV beside the PS3, so we can usually watch whatever is on TV same time as playing PS3 games.\r\n\r\nOthers\r\n\r\n  My cellphone is a Nokia 5800. It's handy and since I don't text much most of my prepaid load gets eaten up by internet data usage when I'm outside of the house. It's also my only camera, so I can't take a picture of it.\r\n  For mobile gaming I have a first-generation silver Nintendo DS and a purple PSP-3000.\r\n  I have a couple of nonworking desktops lying around the house -- we need to figure out what to do with them.\r\n\r\nWhat Software Do You Use?\r\n\r\nThe desktop runs Microsoft Windows 7 Professional, while the laptop dual-boots between Windows 7 Professional and Ubuntu 10.04, which is my primary OS for internet and coding.\r\n\r\nThe programs I use most are Google Chrome/Chromium for internet browsing (Firefox if I'm doing any web coding) and Tweetdeck for the twittering. For coding on Ubuntu I have Eclipse for Java and good &8216;ol gedit for Python. Any document editing is usually done using Google Docs and my email is using GMail (yeah, I like Google!)\r\n\r\nAll the images in this post are available as a flickr set:\r\n  \r\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/zroytang/sets/72157624234499706/\r\n\r\n [1]: http://usesthis.com/\r\n [2]: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4009/4683795890de521c3ccdm.jpg\r\n [3]: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4038/468324007723f9c92f6bm.jpg\r\n [4]: http://roytang.net/blog/2008/06/new-laptop/\r\n [5]: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4059/46832430439ee9da0c5am.jpg\r\n [6]: http://twitter.com/chowtimer\r",

It also posts questions you ask so that any friends you have on facebook not already using stackoverflow might want to help answer 😀\r\n\r\nIt turned out to take a bit more than a weekend (mostly because my weekend was busy), but at least it gave me a chance to try out a few things:\r\n\r\nFacebook's Graph API\r\n  \r\nGoogle App Engine\r\n  \r\nDVCS\r\n\r\nI've toyed around with Google App Engine before, but now was the first time I got to use it for something more useful than following tutorials or writing random \"Hello World\". I pretty much got to try all of the relevant services: cron jobs, tasks, memcache, GQL, etc. Everything was well-documented and easy to follow.\r\n\r\nFacebook on the other hand... this whole thing with their Graph API that they want to release the old REST API with makes things a bit confusing when searching for tutorials, as most of them will be referring to the old REST API, including the python facebook wrapper libraries available. It took me a while to get the authentication and setting up permissions thing going. The great thing is I don't need to go through that again for future facebook apps!\r\n\r\nThis project also gave me a chance to create a bitbucket account and use a DVCS. I picked bitbucket over github because I prefered to have a private repository and mercurial just seemed a lot easier to use than git.\r\n\r\nHere's the StackApps entry. Originally, I wanted to win their contest, but to be honest that seems a bit far-fetched now. My app comes in late to the game and there was already a facebook app listed there before but it's not ranked too high. Besides, we all know @codinghorror isn't a fan of Facebook haha.\r\n\r\nAm I releasing the source? I dunno yet. I'd have to create a public repo on Github, decide on a license, scrub out my API keys from the code and other stuff, so maybe later.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://bitbucket.org\r\n [2]: http://stackapps.com/questions/1163/stack-bragger-facebook-app-to-post-questions-badges \"StackApps entry\"\r\n [3]: http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2010/05/stack-exchange-api-contest/\r",

I never get to answer clearly, so here's an attempt.\r\n\r\nThe short answer is: Whatever I want\r\n\r\nThe long answer:\r\n\r\nYes, I spend a lot of time goofing around -- watching TV series, movies and playing video games. In fact I think for most of the first two months of my hiatus, this was what I did. Now there's a lot less of that -- I've caught up with all the series I wanted to catch up with, and I don't have any significant video games I want to finish. (That may change next week with the release of Starcraft 2 :p). I don't actually watch stuff on television unless I'm having a meal though.\r\n\r\nI read a lot. Mostly online reading (so having an IPad would be nice, hah!). A lot of articles about a variety of topics such as entrepreneurship, new technologies, mobile application development, casual gaming development. Hacker News is a fair approximation of my usual reading material. I probably spend 2-3 hours each day on reading.\r\n\r\nI'm working on some small projects. Not work stuff, not freelancing or anything like that. Just some tools/apps, many of them for my own usage (&#8216;to scratch an itch\", as the saying goes). Often I will start building an app just to try out a certain API or technology. In the past 2 weeks I've looked at: Scala, Ruby, the Android SDK, Google App Engine, the Facebook Graph API, the Twitter API, the Plurk API, Git and Mercurial. It's only recently that I'm getting back into the swing of coding (and seeing my own terrible bugs :p), and I hope to scale that up in the coming months. I want to write more apps that I can release for public consumption.\r\n\r\nSomething people who've been employed all the time don't realize: even if I have a lot of free time, I'm still lazy. :p So there are a lot of backlog tasks I've been meaning to do since forever that I need to get around to. Mostly involves organizing stuff, getting rid of unneeded stuff, returning stuff. Stuff has a maintenance cost, so we should have a lot less of it!\r\n\r\nI'm currently not earning any money and am still considering future plans. It's fine, I can still survive for a while. There are a lot of options, and getting back into a regular employment scenario is only one of them. The more conventional options are getting a job again and/or working abroad (probably Singapore). My brothers and I talk constantly about starting our own company: consulting/software dev (need to find clients), or product development (IPhone/Android... but we're still balking on the high price of entry to the IPhone market, i.e. need a macbook!). A friend of mine keeps telling me we should start working on a casual game, our own Plants vs Zombies as it were. I'm inclined to look into some sort of product development myself, in fact I already have a few design ideas for a casual/social MMO (similar to Castle Age... I like to claim I'm doing research when I play it).\r\n\r\nSo that's the current status. I'm still not sure exactly the direction I should be going -- it's always been one of my weaknesses that when there are a lot of options available I have difficulty making a decision promptly. Getting a job again is the safe yet boring choice; at the same time I'm not sure if I'm equipped with the necessary discipline to handle the more challenging options such as starting my own company.\r\n\r\nIn any case I'm not really in a hurry. The whole point of the hiatus was figuring out what I want to be doing. I'm not sure yet, so hiatus is not yet over. 😀\r\n\r",

The hostage drama unfolded in front of the Quirino Grandstand in Manila with the expected media circus, confused cops and SWAT who didn’t know what to do and a tragic ending that involved dead hostages and a bullet to the head.\r\n\r\nRead the full story on Inquirer.net.\r\n\r\nI wasn’t there of course. In fact when the topic first started trending on twitter I dismissed it and went about whatever I was doing at the time and later took a nap. By the time I woke up, hostages had died and the situation had escalated, negotiations had apparently failed and the SWAT team was ready to assault the bus.\r\n\r\nAt first, like everyone else I was appalled at the incompetence of the law enforcement units handling the matter, especially with the rumors circulating that they had actually had training on this type of bus assault scenario before/recently. But when I think about it, our cops are poor and underpaid and working with substandard equipment and procedures and still they have to risk assaulting that bus and getting shot. I wouldn’t excuse them for the outcome of the event, but things can always end badly and in our case there are so many things contributing to that grisly end.\r\n\r\nWhat about Captain Mendoza, the hostage taker, who claims he was unjustly dismissed from the force? It is easy to blame him as well. Of course we all agree that taking a bus full of tourists hostage is not the best way to air his grievances. But he is just another underpaid cop and was now even denied his measly pension. He could air his concerns to the media but would anyone listen? He could take it up with the courts but how long would that take? Instead of suffering through a long, arduous process of reclaiming his allegedly stolen honor, he chose to take a radical approach to get attention to his cause.\r\n\r\nAnd of course it worked. The media lapped it up. The major TV stations, in their relentless quest for even more ratings kept trying to outdo each other in their coverage and in airing his side and the details of his case. It’s easy to say the media exacerbated the situation what with their broadcasting details of the police operations and of the arrest of the hostage taker’s brother. But the fact is that we the viewing public, we love this stuff, this drama. We stay glued to our TVs and radios and twitter streams, hoping to see how this unsightly assault on our country’s tourism industry would conclude. Can we blame the media for giving us what we want?\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to criticize, but it’s not like we were the ones there on the scene having to deal with the chaos and the media and the rain.\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to lay blame, but we can’t go back and change what happened. Hopefully the people in charge, and that law enforcement and media outlets and even we the people to whom these entities should be held accountable study the failures and learn the lessons and do what needs to be done to avoid another such incident staining our not-so-good-in-the-first-place international reputation.\r\n\r",

If I had swung I would have won, but as it is I forgot that the 4/5 tree would become unanimated and counted the counterattack as lethal so I didn't push and later lost to Plummet.\r\n\r\nMisplay on my part obviously, if I had done the math correctly and figured I'd be alive at 1, then swinging with the team would definitely have been correct!",

I think Scars limited lends itself well to monocolor decks with vast majority of the support provided by artifacts, but I couldn't just had dragon-class bombs in separate colors, so black-red it was. Here's my list:\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist }}\r\n  \r\n[Lands]\r\n  \r\n9 Mountain\r\n  \r\n8 Swamp\r\n  \r\n[/Lands]\r\n  \r\n[Creatures]\r\n  \r\n1 Copper Myr\r\n  \r\n1 Silver Myr\r\n  \r\n1 Leaden Myr\r\n  \r\n1 Gold Myr\r\n  \r\n2 Perilous Myr\r\n  \r\n1 Wall of Tanglecord\r\n  \r\n1 Neurok Replica\r\n  \r\n1 Moriok Replica\r\n  \r\n1 Skinrender\r\n  \r\n1 Blade-Tribe Berserkers\r\n  \r\n2 Bleak-Coven Vampires\r\n  \r\n1 Corrupted Harvester\r\n  \r\n1 Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon\r\n  \r\n1 Hoard-Smelter Dragon\r\n  \r\n[/Creatures]\r\n  \r\n[Spells]\r\n  \r\n3 Galvanic Blast\r\n  \r\n1 Arc Trail\r\n  \r\n1 Barbed Battlegear\r\n  \r\n1 Culling Dais\r\n  \r\n1 Ratchet Bomb\r\n  \r\n[/Spells]\r\n  \r\n[Relevant Sideboard*]\r\n  \r\n1 Rust Tick\r\n  \r\n1 Snapsail Glider\r\n  \r\n1 Flesh Allergy\r\n  \r\n[/Relevant Sideboard*]\r\n  \r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\nI should have probably just maindecked the above listed sideboard cards in the first place, not sure why I didn't, it's not like I was drunk.\r\n\r\nRegarding {{ card }}Bleak Coven Vampires{{ /card }} -- these guys are great, top-notch. Together with the {{ card }}Galvanic Blast{{ /card }}s, I had to reliably trigger Metalcraft, I think the 12-14 artifact count is sufficient to provide the needed consistency.\r\n\r\nRegarding {{ card }}Skithiryx, the Blight Dragon{{ /card }}, I'm going to misspell that all the time, so from hereon, he's called \"Skittles\".\r\n\r\nRound one: I lost the first game to mana screw, as if the gods of magic were punishing me for playing two colors in the format; I drew all swamps and no mountains, losing access to half the spells in my hand. I lost that match 1-2, the game three loss to an infectious {{ card }}Blight Mamba{{ /card }} given intimidate by that evil green uncommon ({{ card }}Bellowing Tanglewurm{{ /card }}). I kept drawing lands while it slowly bled me to death with it's evil poison. My last-ditch blocker met a {{ card }}shatter{{ /card }}ing end! At least I can say this was the first time I lost a tournament match to poision counters.\r\n\r\nRound two was a breeze, and marked the first time I won a tournament match using poison counters. And I did it with Skittles, the only Infect guy in my deck. Hey, my opponent kept gaining life, luckily I had a viable alternate plan of attack. Won 2-0.\r\n\r\nRound three, the guy was all cool and had three colors of basics, plus a bunch of mana myr, it's like he was doing nothing exciting, then all of a sudden brings out a {{ card }}Liege of the Tangle{{ /card }} on me! Luckily I had the double {{ card }}Galvanic Blast{{ /card }} with metalcraft active and he groaned. I lost game two to a quick {{ card }}Tangle Angler{{ /card }} with {{ card }}Darksteel Axe{{ /card }} after stalling on lands due to a poor keep (True Magic Confessions episode 17: I don't mulligan aggressively enough). In game three I drew the {{ card }}Flesh Allergy{{ /card }} I boarded in for the {{ card }}Liege of the Tangle{{ /card }} and just slowrolled that bad boy until he drew and played the Liege. Ha! Sacrificing {{ card }}Perilous Myr{{ /card }} to {{ card }}Flesh Allergy{{ /card }} is awesome when your opponent is at four life. Won 2-1.\r\n\r\nRound four, my opponent was UR. In game one neither of had much gas and had to resort to trading blows with our 1/1 mana myrs, but I pulled out ahead after he drew too many lands and I had 3 mana myrs to clock him with. Game two, he tapped out for {{ card }}Saberclaw Golem{{ /card }} and I was thinking of taking it out with a non-boosted G-Blast, but for some reason thought it would be better to do so on his turn. Of course when he untaps he already has {{ card }}Stoic Rebuttal{{ /card }} ready, a card I already saw in game one and hence should have been aware of! I went on tilt a bit and subsequently blocked the Golem looking to trade creatures, but then he just smiled and paid the red mana to give it first strike. Facepalm!\r\n\r\nI did the mental Saito faceslap and toughened up my focus for game three. I stayed in control all game, making only a minor mistake of unnecessarily untapping the {{ card }}Rust Tick{{ /card }} at one point, but was well ahead in life totals anyway and finished him off with 2 {{ card }}Galvanic Blast{{ /card }}s.\r\n\r\nSo anyway I fail to make 4-0 for the nth time in a row. I haven't 4-0'd since Time Spiral I think. It's fine, Prereleases should be very casual events anyway so I have a tendency to maybe play a bit looser than I would at a PTQ for example.\r\n\r\nPrize packs did not contain anything exciting. Well, a {{ card }}Genesis Wave{{ /card }} but that's more of a fun, casual card.\r\n\r\nTLDR; Went 3-1 at my local Scars of Mirrodin Prerelease.\r\n\r\nExtra discussion topic: A friend and I were talking about how newbie-unfriendly Prereleases can be, even though it's supposed to be pretty much a \"casual affair\". There are always a bunch of guys who are at their first sealed event and they take a while to register, and a lot of them don't know that the registered pool won't necessarily be the one they're going to play and get to take home. And where I play, most of the Prereleases will have the local \"sharks\" playing, they will usually play multiple flights. I try to keep a friendly atmosphere, but many of them are always dead serious even though it's just a prerelease, making new tournament players or young kids a bit nervous. Of course it has to be that way because there are prizes on the line, right?\r\n\r\nMy friend suggested a separate type of prerelease event where entrants are guaranteed some small token prizes (maybe two packs), regardless of their win-loss record, and some trophy prize (like a t-shirt) for going undefeated. Rules enforcement might be looser -- maybe no longer requiring deck registration or pool swaps. This would make it more casual and less appealing to \"sharks\", but I'm not sure how popular it would be. I'm thinking maybe we need some more casual events here like gunslinging or Intro Pack duels thing that WOTC staff sometimes talk about -- we don't usually have that sort of thing in local events.\r\n\r\nOf course, we couldn't come up with a clear solution to make Prerelease events easier for new guys, but it's worth a thought, right?\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Switch on 2011-05-23 03:58:14 +0000\r\nRe: extra discussion, the prereleases here are usually pretty friendly affairs, friendly enough to get my girlfriend to play. The prize scheme is a little different, with 1 pack for less than a win and a draw, 2 packs for 4-8 points, 4 packs for 9-10 points and 6 for 11-12 points (if i remember correctly). I think in general you should loosen up at these things, but geography and relative costs are a factor here, as well, since there's probably ten venues with events, usually both days, and a large event at Suntec.",

It was purchased from Singapore and brought to me by a friend last Friday. I've used an iPad before (during the CCS trip Baguio), but this is the first time I've had the chance to customize the applications and content, and have it exclusive for my own use. I've had it for about a day and half, here are my snap judgments and quick impressions:\r\n\r\ndiv id=\"_mcePaste\"\r\n  strongGeneral usage/strong\r\n/div\r\n\r\ndiv id=\"_mcePaste\"\r\n  ul\r\n    li\r\n      The USB cable used to connect the iPad to a PC is also the one used to connect it to a plug for charging via an electric outlet. This is all kinds of brilliant and literally had me with my jaw open for a few seconds.\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      Charging via USB is extremely slow, around 10% per hour, and the iPad will even lie about it and say \"Not Charging\". Charging via outlet is much faster.\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      Typing on the virtual keyboard is ok for short form fields or notes type of things, but I can't imagine doing it for longer typing tasks such as blog posts (I will probably try it as some future time). I find myself typing most comfortably using one hand as it can reach across the keyboard quite easily. The lack of tactile feedback will take some getting used to. As my friend noted the virtual keyboard has touch type indicators on the F and J keys for some reason!\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      Storage: 64gb might be overkill, probably 32gb would have been enough. I don't see myself using the video watching functions when I'm at home (there are better options for that), so I only need to load enough videos on it to be able to have something to watch when I have downtime outside of home. On the other hand, I haven't really delved that much into downloading apps and podcasts, there's a good chance I may be able to fill up the space eventually\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      3G: I have not yet used the 3g. According to a href=\"http://twitter.com/Talk2Globe\"@Talk2Globe/a, the prepaid microsim will not work with an iPad (I won't be able to reload it I guess) and I have to use their unlimited data plan microsim (P999 a month). That's actually not so bad, but I think I'm going to check first with Smart whether their prepaid microsim can be used. a href=\"http://twitter.com/smartCARES\"@SmartCARES/a has not yet replied\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      There is no easy out of the box way to use the iPad's 64gb as an external flash drive. There should be!\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      The volume when watching videos is not very good unless you are using earphones\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      For home usage, the most awesome thing is really internet usage at the bed. I have not yet started up my laptop since I came home with the iPad. I would guess that I would only use the laptop for coding or writing work from here on.\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n/div\r\n\r\ndiv\r\n  strongiTunes and Syncing/strong\r\n/div\r\n\r\ndiv id=\"_mcePaste\"\r\n  ul\r\n    li\r\n      iTunes is not a very intuitive piece of software for someone who has never used an iOS device before.\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      When you add a folder or files to the media library, there seems to be no indicator if some videos are not compatible (I did not know the compatibility requirements at first)\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      The default mode is to sync the local library completely and automatically with the device contents; this seemed totally ridiculous to me as it means all the content will be duplicated on both devices. I have more than 64gb of content on my desktop!\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      In the file sharing dialog, not clear you can use the delete key to remove files shared with your apps. Actually, sharing files with apps in general feels unwieldy, especially if you plan to share a lot of files. There are no organization options like folders or whatever, and it must be done using iTunes.\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n/div\r\n\r\ndiv\r\n  strongApps/strong\r\n/div\r\n\r\ndiv id=\"_mcePaste\"\r\n  ul\r\n    li\r\n      I've only tried a few apps, and have not yet paid for anything on the App Store. Must resist impulse buys!\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      The best app I've seen so far from a visual wow-factor awesome-features point of view is strongFlipboard/strong. My Mom picked up the iPad while I had Flipboard open and was like \"Wow!\" for maybe five to ten minutes.\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      Twitter apps: the official twitter app seems ok, but I'm usingstrong Twitterrific/strong at the moment. I heard Tweetdeck is buggy.\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      strongFacebook/strong: The facebook app on the app store is for iphone only, so I have to do the 2x size thing. It doesn't look very good (and doesn't seem to rotate well)\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      strongVLC/strong: Supposedly the solution to the lack of supported video formats in iTunes, it is a bit immature. At first I tried loading a lot of files into it (gotta maximize the 64gb!) but then it wouldn't launch and would just crash back to desktop. It turns out it cannot handle MKV files very well, it worked when I only loaded AVIs\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      strongStanza/strong: PDF and comic book reader. The reading mode is pretty good, but it looks like it's going to be unwieldy if managing a large collection\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      I haven't settled on a feed reader app yet (not sure if there are any good free ones), Google Reader via Safari seems to be fine at the moment\r\n    /li\r\n    li\r\n      I've just downloaded a few free games to try them out\r\n    /li\r\n  /ul\r\n/div\r\n\r\nJailbreaking\r\n\r\n  I don't have any plans to Jailbreak the iPad at this time. I have not explored the possibility at all, but I'm not really inclined to yet. Maybe I'll change my mind later.\r\n\r\nThat's my iPad experience as of now. I actually also started a thread on Reddit to help me get jump started. Overall, very impressive and such an awesome toy, we'll see how it stacks up in terms of how much I use it in the coming months.\r\n\r\nIf anyone has any tips or suggestions to help me enjoy the new toy, feel free to comment 😀\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/duddt/imgettinganipadtomorrowwhatdoi_needto/\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by dave on 2010-10-24 14:22:23 +0000\r\nEi, btw d00d, you left the screen protector cloth thing here.

Haha. Personally, gusto ko hintayin ang version na may facetime (sans any external hardware).\r\n\r\nRegarding the slow (and misleading) USB charging, I think that happens when you try to charge with a mobile device (e.g. a laptop). By standard, USB connectors on desktops provide a more \"stable\" power output as compared to mobile devices due to their (more often) lack of a \"fixed\" power source.\r\n\r\nHTH 🙂",

I'll spare you the boring details, except for the fact that at some point I had to be given spinal anesthesia while I was fully awake. Now, if you've never been given spinal anesthesia before, let me give you a rundown: you'll be asked to lie on your side and curl up into something like a C-shaped fetal position so that the anesthesiologist can inject a tiny needle into a small area between the discs of your spinal column. It's not exactly the most fun thing in the world; and for someone like me who was a low tolerance for pain, even the tiny pinpricks would cause me to involuntarily contract my spine, giving the anesthesiologist trouble and requiring her to try another location, hence an additional pinprick and a vicious cycle that seemed to go on forever. Hence, it was not the most pleasant of experiences.\r\n\r\nAs I lie there however, I found myself thinking how in the olden days soldiers who went off to war and got wounded would have their open wounds treated and sutured without the help of any anesthesia at all with no choice but for them to grit their teeth and bear it. Me on the other hand, after taking this spinal anesthesia, the surgeon would be working on an open wound and I would lie there, fully awake not feeling a thing and wondering \"what the hell is going on down there, maybe I don't really want to know.\"\r\n\r\nMy point is not that I should be damn thankful I live in the modern world and I'm taking spinal anesthesia at all (though that is probably true), but rather that it can be downright amazing how far changes in science and technology have taken us.\r\n\r\nThe second thing: If there's anything which has changed the world so much over the past decode or two, it's the internet. It's weird that my first usage of the internet wasn't in an academic setting like I would imagine it was in other more developed areas, but rather as a channel where we could get anime fanfiction. I have memories of fifteen years ago after or between classes at UP, there would be me, Mike and Art walking off to an \"internet cafe\" on Katipunan and hanging out there while browsing the old Anime Turnpike website or something like that (don't visit Anipike now, it's terrible). Young college me sharing an internet workstation with two other guys would never have imagined that more than a decade later internet usage would be so pervasive in my life that I carry around not just one but two internet-capable devices on a daily basis and that I interact with people, friends and family all over the world online on a regular basis and practically all the news and media I consume come from online sources.\r\n\r\nSince I'm recovering from surgery, I have a lot of time to pontificate, so I found myself thinking about how social media has changed the way celebrity works. Before Twitter or Facebook, we would hear about what celebrities were up to on the news, in the papers or television or radio, but they would always seem so remote and the average person would in his lifetime never have any personal interaction with famous people. But today, you could tweet to Shaq (@THE\\REAL\\SHAQ) or Neil Patrick Harris (@actuallynph) or even lesser celebrities like author Neil Gaiman (@neilhimself) or even a local TV personality like Kim Atienza (@kuyakim_atienza), and there would be a reasonable chance of getting a reply. We see more into other people's lives through social media, and that has changed the world for celebrities.\r\n\r\nI find it all fascinating and amazing. And even more than that, within my lifetime there will probably be even more quantum leaps in the way science or technology affects our day to day to lives, things we couldn't even imagine right now. The future beckons to us, and I can't wait to see what it will bring.\r\n\r\nTLDR; I'm randomly amazed at everyday things\r\n\r\n [1]: http://twitter.com/THEREALSHAQ\r\n [2]: http://twitter.com/actuallynph\r\n [3]: http://twitter.com/neilhimself\r\n [4]: http://twitter.com/kuyakim_atienza\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Kerwin on 2010-11-23 23:49:52 +0000\r\ni'm telling you, the time will come when no one will be going out of their houses at all, they'll all be interacting online.\r\n\r\nComment by roy on 2010-11-24 03:27:54 +0000\r\n@Kerwin: Actually with the trends in mobile internet usage, it's more likely that the opposite will be true -- the online world will be leaving people's houses and interacting with us in the outside world!",

        "content": "---\r\nakttnotifytwitter:\r\nfalse\r\nauthor: roy\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2010-12-20 15:33:57\r\ntitle: A Christmas Story\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2010/12/a-christmas-story/\r\n---\r\n\r\nOkay, story time.\r\n\r\nOn my way home today as I was about to get on the jeep to Tandang Sora, a woman got off the jeep crying uncontrollably and declaring she would not go with him. Unsure what was going on I walked past the woman who was now wailing unintelligibly outside the jeep. I got on the jeep and took a seat. Inside was this man who was gesturing to the woman outside and telling her to be quiet and just get in the jeep. The woman was replying that she didn't want to go with him to wherever they were going.\r\n\r\nFinally, the jeep was filled with passengers, with the woman still outside making a scene. The jeep started moving and the woman started chasing after the jeep all the while still crying and shouting \"Harold bumalik ka dito, wag mo ko iwanan kausapin mo ko ng maayos!\"\r\n\r\nAfter maybe five to ten meters of this, the jeep had not yet picked up full speed so the man told the driver to wait and to let the woman get on the jeep. The woman caught up with us but still refused to get on the jeep, instead trying to pull the man out of the jeep from the estribo. \"Bumaba ka dito Harold kausapin mo ko ng maayos!\" The man, visibly annoyed, told the driver to just leave her and the jeep started moving again. But the woman hung on and was now on all fours near the vehicle's entrance still pleading to the man that she didn't want to go \"there\" and that they should get off the jeep and talk about it.\r\n\r\nThis went on while the jeep was about to go through the elliptical road, so the rest of the passengers told the man to do something about it as the woman's position was obviously dangerous. Looking quite exasperated the man finally reaches down and pulls the woman into the jeep, but she refuses to take a seat and hasn't stopped sobbing uncontrollably while pleading with the man that they should no longer go \"there\". I'm sitting right across from them and the woman is now kneeling on the floor of the vehicle with her head on the man's lap. The jeep goes on its way. Me and the other passengers look on but the man just shrugs at us saying that she always does this, always throws tantrums and makes a scene.\r\n\r\nAs we make our way along elliptical road and eventually through Visayas avenue, some more tidbits and details emerge from the woman's ramblings. \"Wag mo ko dadalhin dun, bubugbugin lang ako dun\", she cries and the man replies with \"Anong pinagsasabi mo? Sino naman ang mananakit sa yo dun.\" Later she says \"Wag mo kong dadalhin dun sa babae mo\" and \"alam mo naman hindi ako nakakapalag sa inyong dalawa.\"\r\n\r\nI was a bit indifferent until now, as it seemed mostly like an overreaction to a lover's spat which I probably didn't have any business intruding in. The man had been acting frustrated, not angry or threatening in any way while the woman made her scene. But the added details changed the story somewhat and I was troubled. Was this woman a victim of domestic abuse? The way the man picked her up and pulled her into the jeep took on a different dimension. I didn't know the details, but me and a few other passengers stared at him, maybe just a little bit accusingly. He shrugs as if defensively, \"Parati na lang siyang ganyan.\"\r\n\r\nEventually they get off near the bridge along Visayas Avenue. Some of the passengers start talking about it. \"Mali din yung lalaki, kahit na ano pa nangyari nde nya dapat pinaiyak ung babae.\" I keep silent and withhold my judgment; I had not actually seen him perform any violence on the woman, I reasoned, I should not judge without knowing all the details.\r\n\r\nThe incident lasted no more than ten, maybe fifteen minutes, but it left me wondering whether I should have said something to the man, whether I should have intervened or asked them at least what was going on, especially when the possibility of domestic violence was revealed. But I didn't, and neither did anybody else. As I stepped off the jeep I was trying to justify it to myself: I didn't know the entire situation, it was none of my business, what could I have done for them in that short time, etc. One of the other passengers had commented \"Mahirap na makialam\", and somehow I felt that way too, that it was none of my business. I guess most people would be expected to react that way, but I've always prided myself that I didn't do things just because \"most people\" do it.\r\n\r\nOk, admittedly this story was not very Christmas-y. But it made me think of a discussion I had earlier in the day about how it was hard to feel the Christmas spirit anymore with all the stuff that needs to be done at work, all the shopping time and the large crowds in the malls and all. But there I was in a small timespan with an opportunity to maybe help or even just listen to another troubled soul  and I couldn't be bothered. No one else was. The other passengers just looked at them as they got off, made a few snide comments and that was that. The driver just wanted to get on with his trip so he could maybe earn some money. Maybe I'm over-thinking it a bit, maybe it was just some sort of breakdown on the woman's part or something. Or maybe I just missed an opportunity to exhibit some Christmas spirit.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Jaime on 2011-01-23 11:18:06 +0000\r\nI think the key here is to differentiate what is help, and what would be aggravating the situation.\r\n\r\nIn your mind, nothing violent happened, and you cannot \"fix\" the situation without knowing what the problem was, so what was there for you to do? Interview the guy (since the woman was not in any state to be interviewed) and get an informative answer?\r\n\r\nCalling the DSWD hotline might have been the \"best\" thing to do at the time, but that's just effort transfer, and you're not even sure who's right. No smoking gun. No scarring on the woman's body (kung binubugbog nga siya, you would see it on her). It might have been just a scene, or still a lover's spat gone wrong, or actual domestic violence, but unlike police, you have no right to react to it without being intrusive as there is no physical evidence -- good Samaritan or not.\r\n\r\nI would not trust the man's information, nor the woman's. So it's really hard to intervene in this case without a thorough investigation or background.",

Heck, I haven't really played tournament Magic in a while, not seriously at least. For that reason it may have been a bad idea to run with a deck that requires a lot of matchup knowledge to play. The tournament was Grand Prix Singapore 2011, the format was standard and my weapon of choice was Caw Blade:\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist }}\r\n  \r\n[Lands]\r\n  \r\n4 Island\r\n  \r\n3 Plains\r\n  \r\n4 Celestial Colonnade\r\n  \r\n4 Glacial Fortress\r\n  \r\n1 Inkmoth Nexus\r\n  \r\n1 Marsh Flats\r\n  \r\n1 Scalding Tarn\r\n  \r\n4 Seachrome Coast\r\n  \r\n4 Tectonic Edge\r\n  \r\n[/Lands]\r\n  \r\n[Creatures]\r\n  \r\n4 Stoneforge Mystic\r\n  \r\n4 Squadron Hawk\r\n  \r\n2 Mirran Crusader\r\n  \r\n[/Creatures]\r\n  \r\n[Spells]\r\n  \r\n4 Preordain\r\n  \r\n4 Spell Pierce\r\n  \r\n3 Mana Leak\r\n  \r\n3 Into the Roil\r\n  \r\n2 Condemn\r\n  \r\n1 Sword of Feast and Famine\r\n  \r\n1 Sword of War and Peace\r\n  \r\n1 Batterskull\r\n  \r\n1 Jace Beleren\r\n  \r\n4 Jace the Mind Sculptor\r\n  \r\n[/Spells]\r\n  \r\n[Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n1 Sword of Body and Mind\r\n  \r\n1 Sylvok Lifestaff\r\n  \r\n2 Spellskite\r\n  \r\n3 Flashfreeze\r\n  \r\n2 Divine Offering\r\n  \r\n2 Celestial Purge\r\n  \r\n2 Day of Judgment\r\n  \r\n2 Dismember\r\n  \r\n[/Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\nI actually ran this deck through a couple of grinders, both times losing to RUG variants, and that was practically all the playtesting time I had aside from a few random casual games the Friday before the GP. Oh well, we go with what we have.\r\n\r\nRound 1 I played versus another Filipino who was visiting Singapore from Malaysia. Apparently he had just come in this morning via bus and was running on only a couple of hours sleep. That didn't stop him from wrecking me game one with a {{ card }}Phyrexian Obliterator{{ /card }} bearing a {{ card }}Lashwrithe{{ /card }}. Yup, he was playing Monoblack control. I had actually mulliganned to five and he tore my hand apart with pinpoint discard before that Obliterator took me down in two swings. For game two I brought in Celestial Purges and Divine Offerings, taking out Mana Leaks and the Jace Beleren. I easily won game two off a Mirran Crusader that got his War and Peace on. Game three started off poorly for me as this time I mulled to four, keeping a one lander. Luckily I drew into what I needed and he was drawing mostly land. I managed to play a Hawk (refilling my hand) before he played a surprise sideboarded {{ card }}Torpor Orb{{ /card }} cutting me off from my equipment. He played a couple of creatures -- an Obliterator and a {{ card }}Vampire Nighthawk{{ /card }} before I managed to land a Jace that eventually allowed me to stabilize. By this time however, most of my creatures were out, though I well had the game under control. So I just proceeded to fateseal him every turn and finish him off with Jace's ultimate.\r\n\r\n1-0 matches, 2-1 games\r\n\r\nRound 2 My round 2 opponent was... er, I'm not sure. He was definitely Singaporean and I think he was playing either Darkblade or Cawblade. But I did win, in 3 games!\r\n\r\n2-0 matches 4-2 games\r\n\r\nRound 3 My round 3 opponent was definitely Caw Blade, and was another Filipino who was working in Singapore. He seemed even more inexperienced with the deck than I was though, as I saw when we had some exchanges like me blocking his Batterskull that had a Feast and Famine with my Hawk that had a Batterskull and Feast and Famine. Nevermind the fact that I had more toughness, he hadn't even realized I had protection from his germ token. I don't remember the other details well, but I won in 3 games again.\r\n\r\n3-0 matches, 6-3 games\r\n\r\nAt the start of Round 4 they called the first feature match: Owen Turtenwald vs Steven Tan. I kind of did a double take when I heard the Steven Tan part.\r\n\r\nRound 4 My opponent was Singaporean, and he lead with forest into Birds of Paradise. I thought he was some sort of RUG but turns out he was straight RG Valakut. The matchup is as easy as I had read, since he has so few creatures to help him establish control and very little in the way of spot removal. A Mirran Crusader bearing War and Peace was enough to win game one. In game two he hesitated before keeping his hand after he had mulliganned to five and I decided to be merciless and give him the Eye of the Tiger (TM). He played turn two Explore and I answered with Spell Pierce. Turn 3 Cobra and I answered with Flashfreeze. Turn 4 Explore (still stuck on three lands) and I had the second Spell Pierce. By this time I had solid control and he would never be able to recover.\r\n\r\n4-0 matches, 8-3 games\r\n\r\nI was feeling great at this point, but was well aware that by now I was in danger of running into pros, and my record against pros is not surprisingly quite bad.\r\n\r\nRound 5 I actually thought I was paired against fffreak himself Brad Nelson, but it turns out it was a guy named Brandom Nelson. He was a scrawny American (reminded me somehow of Reid from Criminal Minds), so I wasn't sure if he was related to Brad Nelson. I later found out he was actually fffreakslittlebro hence the name similarity and that they are step brothers or half brothers or something hence the difference in appearance. He was bringing Caw Blade as well, and the difference of playtesting showed up here quite easily. He played quickly; as soon as I had played a turn 2 Hawk he would ask me how many I was getting and would proceed to say, \"then you're done right\" and start his turn while I was still shuffling. \"No need to waste time,\" he would murmur.\r\n\r\nHe got a Mystic first and went for Batterskull. My Mystic went for a Feast and Famine, I figured I would need to grind him out, treating it as a control matchup. I was probably already wrong here, but I didn't have long to figure it out. His next creature was a Mirran Crusader and the turn after that he got a War and Peace on it (he never played the Batterskull), with Spell Pierce backup for my Into the Roil, and I died quickly.\r\n\r\nSecond game was worse for me, as I was low on lands and he kept me low with a Tectonic Edge on my sixth and seventh lands. I held him off for a while, countering a Jace and hitting a Batterskull with Divine Offering, but eventually he lands a Sun Titan and starts recurring Tectonic Edge and I have no chance. First loss down.\r\n\r\n4-1 matches, 8-5 games\r\n\r\nThat was a bit heartbreaking, I felt like he knew the matchup inside-out (he probably did) and just crushed me at every opportunity. I went into round six a bit off... \r\n\r\nRound 6 was against a Malaysian guy sporting RB Vampires. He led with a quick pair of {{ card }}Vampire Lacerator{{ /card }}s into a {{ card }}Kalastria Highborn{{ /card }}. I remember going for the early Batterskull, but my notes don't show me gaining life, instead losing it in chunks of four. I think he killed the Germ somehow.\r\n\r\nGame two he had the same opening, but this time I had more ammunition to hold him off. I would draw Celestial Purges and Into the Roils before I eventually managed to Jace into DoJ, but it took forever and I had to chump block quite a number of Hawks before I stabilized.. During this time he had managed to {{ card }}Crush{{ /card }} or {{ card }}Manic Vandal{{ /card }} away the equipment I was searching with my Mystics. I looked at the clock and saw that there were less than twenty minutes left in the round so I started speeding up the pace. I already had control but was at a low five life and had to resort to attacking with a Mystic bearing a Sylvok Lifestaff to bring him down from 12 while he tried to put away the last few points of damage. I lock him down with Tectonic Edges to keep him at less than four lands, but eventually he gets a creature through and drops me to 3 as he's at 4. I Tectonic Edge the last red source he has and swing to bring him to 2. He draws his card and sighs showing me the {{ card }}Lightning Bolt{{ /card }} that would have killed me, then we shuffle up for game 3.\r\n\r\nWe barely had five minutes left as we started game three, and at that point I knew it was already pretty much a draw. He actually still managed to open with the 2 Lacerators and the Highborn, and followed up with a couple of Bloodghasts, but my hand was chock-full of condemns, celestial purges and into the roils, he had no chance to put me away in five minutes. So we ended in a draw. And in this vicious unforgiving grand prix day one, that draw might as well have been a loss and we both fell into do or die mode.\r\n\r\n4-1-1 matches, 9-6-1 games\r\n\r\nInterestingly, the table beside us was a Cawblade mirror between two Caucasians that fell into a draw as well, and they spent quite a few minutes talking among themselves on how they'll handle it, as neither of them wanted to give up the win. Eventually they just got a draw as well.\r\n\r\nRound 7 My Belgian opponent led with Island into Preordain and I had played so much Caw Blade I just assumed that was what he had. The second land however was a Mountain, followed by another Preordain and I realized I had fallen prey to the boogeyman matchup -- Exarch Twin. Well I figured I just had to be careful not to tap out, and indeed I managed to be aggrressive, going Hawk into Hawk into Mystic into Batterskull. Eventually as I attacked for with 4 creatures for 7 damage he flashed in the {{ card }}Deceiver Exarch{{ /card }} to tap down the germ and I kind of panicked as the only instant speed response I had in hand was an {{ card }}Into the Roil{{ /card }}. I pondered whether to play it or not and at some point even tapped the four mana. If I sent it back to his hand immediately, he would just do the same thing on his next attack and then I would have nothing. So I held back and just dealt my 3 damage. Post-combat I played a Mystic to get Feast and Famine, hoping to grind out his hand, but as was pointed out to me later, it was a crucial mistake as I was left with only four mana untapped. On his turn he played the {{ card }}Splinter Twin{{ /card }} and I responded with Into the Roil, but had no mana to pay for the Mana Leak. The Twin resolved and we were on to game two.\r\n\r\nI resolved to play tighter as I boarded in Spellskites and Dismembers, but it was for naught as I was stuck at 3 islands and a plains for most of the game, with him keeping me off a fifth land via Tectonic Edges. He played a Manic Vandal for the first equipment my Mystic flashed in, and I dared not tap out after that since I could die at any time, which meant I was restricted to playing one two mana spell a turn so that I could keep up a Mana Leak available. Eventually I got nothing and that Manic Vandal actually went all the way (I drew a Dismember with too few life to kill him).\r\n\r\nSigh.\r\n\r\n4-2-1 matches, 9-7-1 games, and that's it for me.\r\n\r\nReally, the losses were due to the general lack of practice and playtesting which made them a bit frustrating. But that's life I guess, and a consequence of putting things together at the last minute. At least I have more experience when I go to play in the upcoming Nationals Qualifiers.\r\n\r\nI'll probably skip Shanghai, despite it being a limited GP, as I'd like to limit the damage to international GP a year. I'm still not willing nor able to commit the amount of playtesting and practice time to compete at the international level apparently, but at least I'm already doing better than the 0-3 starts I got the last 2 GPs I attended. We'll see where I go with Magic from here.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

I like bullet points, so here's a summary of my trip:\r\n\r\nProps:\r\n\r\n  public transportation. One thing Singapore and Hong Kong have in common: well-defined, convenient and tourist-friendly public transportation systems, namely trains and buses. It makes our local buses and trains here pale by comparison. The trains are well-maintained and more or less go everywhere including to and from the airport (there's really no need to take an airport taxi unless you arrive some time after the trains close), and there are maps everywhere and machines that dispense tickets and such. The buses can get crowded but still well-organized. There are numerous bus stops and they identify the bus numbers that pass by that stop and many stops will also have maps and routes shown; buses are tracked via GPS so some stops will tell you how long until the bus arrives. They even have an iPhone app that helps you find your bus. Oh, and of course you can buy one of those reloadable cards that you can use to pay for buses and trains. Okay, I really liked the public transpo system. 😀\r\n  Mike and Tin (congrats again guys :D) and the rest of the Singapore guys who put up with the visiting team, especially since they let me crash at their place on my last night there.\r\n  12 mbps internet at Mike and Tin's place, which meant we were able to spend a couple of hours one night just watching stupid youtube videos continuously and letting me get my ass kicked at SSF4 online without any lag. Arr, makes me wish ISPs on our side weren't so terrible\r\n  anime. Well, just the fact that I probably watched more anime over the weekend stay than I have over the past year or so. At least I now have some idea who these Fate/Stay Night people are.\r\n  air travel. In general, my Cebu Pacific flights went smoothly (I even slept well on the flight back) and I breezed through customs and immigrations both ways without much concern. I'm always a bit worried about some unexpected problems like baggage getting lost (so I never check in baggage) or some problem with the bookings or my travel documents or whatever.\r\n\r\nSlops:\r\n\r\n  very muggy weather, making it very uncomfortable to travel outside (to be fair, now that I'm back in Manila it feels almost the same here). It felt good to take a shower back at the hotel everyday\r\n  Oxford hotel for not having free internet and serving basically the same breakfast everyday. Oh and aircon unit that dripped on the couch; I actually woke up with water all over my iPad's case (luckily not broken)\r\n  the Grand Prix Singapore venue, for being so far from the train station\r\n  me for trying to get into the driver's side of the taxi\r\n\r\nSomewhere in between:\r\n\r\n  I guess I'm fairly satisfied with how I fared in the Grand Prix, despite my sloppy misplays at some point. At least I broke my curse of going 0-3 all the time in Grand Prix tournaments. I'll write up a tournament report in a couple of days\r\n  getting off at the wrong bus stop in Telok Blangah, causing me to wander amongst the apartment building while carrying my huge bag and there was a slight drizzle. It's not completely a bad thing, as I kind of enjoy wandering around by myself on foot. It's something I've done in other countries I visited (usually at night), but didn't really get the chance in Singapore because once I got back to the airconditioned room in the hotel, I didn't really want to go out 😀\r\n\r\nAs per usual in my travels to other countries, I did not spend much time shopping or sight-seeing or any touristy stuff like that. I'm not really a tourist kind of person. Overall the trip was ok it was great to be able to visit and meet up with friends, compete in the Grand Prix and see how daily life is in Singapore (still not inclined to work there though :p)\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Switch on 2011-06-07 06:48:52 +0000\r\nFairly comprehensive! We're glad you enjoyed the trip, and that you could come over.\r\n\r\nNot much to vouch for going here for, so I guess the next bet is the next GP here. Unless you want to watch the F1 GP, that is.",

I had actually seen Green Lantern first despite X1C showing two weeks before the DC movie. It's a good time to be a comic book fan with all these comic book movies coming out; I saw Thor a couple of months ago and of course we still have Captain America to look forward to next year.\r\n\r\nAt some level though I've started thinking that being a big comic book fan is actually a bit of a handicap when watching these big Hollywood adaptations of our favorite spandex-clad heroes, if only because we cringe twice at much at every small fault or piece of bad writing that we find in these movies.\r\n\r\nI may have subconsciously delayed watching X1C because one of my brothers had watched it while I was in Singapore and didn't really give the gushing review \"regular\" people had given. And GL wasn't getting such rave reviews on opening weekend either and there were rumors that even the studio was not confident in the movie. So I came into both movies with a bit of lowered expectations.\r\n\r\nMy quick reviews of the two movies first then: X1C was fun and it was nice seeing an entirely new crew of mutants (more or less). I can forgive the ridiculous recruitment and training montages (and lol'ed at the cameo). It looks they didn't bother keeping in continuity with the first trilogy and Wolverine: Origins, which is fine since Wolverine: Origins was ridiculous anyway. The ending felt a bit contrived in the same way that the ending of Smallville and Wolverine: Origins did -- mainly because they need to wrap up things to sync with whatever \"continuity\" they're supposed to have. The movie feels a bit campy at times and it's far from the \"Dark Knight of X-Men\" that some reviews made it out to be, but still a good watch.\r\n\r\nGreen Lantern was fun as well, though the writing left a bit to be desired for me. At some points the abrupt transitions and especially the poor portrayal of Carol Ferris reminded me of Smallville-quality writing at some point. It's still a good movie to watch and the scale is definitely more epic than X1C, but it kind of left me hanging the same way Thor did: it's like there wasn't much that happened in the movie aside from the telling of the origin story.\r\n\r\nMaybe I was just spoiled by Nolan, but Batman Begins set a new height for me in terms of superhero origin movies, and the latest set have yet to reach that bar.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Batman I've also just finished watching the DC straight to video animated feature \"Under the Red Hood\" which covers the death and resurrection of Jason Todd (duh, spoilers) and to be honest I found the climactic scene more well-written than the above two movies. But then again Under the Red Hood follows the comic book story arc more closely so I guess it's closer to the type of stories I enjoy on a regular basis. In fact I find that the DC animated film line to be pretty good; not something I'd watch in a cinema or anything but enjoyable enough.\r\n\r\nThis is just really more or less random ramblings about comic books and comic book movies so here's something else I thought of while watching X1C: the problem with the character of Magneto or in general any character whose origin story or background is tied to a real-life historical event the same way Magneto's is tied to the holocaust. See the problem is that comic book characters live in some sort of time-distorting reality bubble where they don't grow old as fast as the readers do. Characters like Magneto however, have no choice but to grow old at the regular rate, since we cannot move the historical dates upon which their characters are based. In twenty to thirty years, Magneto will be a hundred years old regardless of what happens in X-Men continuity. How will they make X-Men movies then, will they have a hundred year-old Ian McKellen take the role? With the character of Magneto anchored in time, the fictional world of the X-Men remains tied to a particular era. They'll probably come up with some handwaved solution about how his powers include not aging; or maybe they'll take a bold leap and actually kill him off permanently (hey, they haven't brought back Jean Grey for a while right?)\r\n\r\nOn a side note, the first character that I ever noticed had this problem was Bab from Pugad Baboy.\r\n\r\nAnyway maybe that's enough rambling for now. Looking forward to Captain America, Transformers 3, etc, etc. Despite my not being 100% satisfied with the current wave of superhero movies, it's still a good time to be a comic book fan. 😀\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Ritchie on 2011-06-24 15:22:15 +0000\r\nThe only problem I have with X-Men First Class is that SOME IDIOT thought Magneto looked good in yellow.\r\n\r\nWhen I watch comic movies, the first thing I tell myself is that it's a different universe, meaning events that happen won't necessarily mirror the comic origins. All I really care about is that the characters remain true to their core essence (for example, Magneto NOT looking good in yellow). On the topic of GL, that's precisely my issue with it. Hal's essence isn't that of a light-hearted joker. Every time I looked at a trailer, I was seeing Kyle Rayner PRETENDING to be Hal Jordan. I know Reynolds is a popular actor, but he was a TERRIBLE choice for Hal. For a reverse analogy, it's like they hired Michael Rosenbaum to play Spider-Man.\r\n\r\nThor, on the other hand, hit all the right notes for me because the characters were being true to the behavior people expected of them (though I'll admit it wouldn't have hurt if Jane Foster was more independent and forceful instead of being so awed at Thor), and the casting was solid.\r\n\r\nComment by roy on 2011-06-25 15:58:28 +0000\r\nI don't actually mind Magneto in the yellow and blue. I guess in my head he wasn't really that guy yet. I agree that the wisecracking Hal Jordan wasn't particularly keeping true to the character, but at least they kept it to a minimum and most of the jokes are left in Hal's apartment. I agree that Reynolds is a terrible choice though, as it's hard to take him seriously :p",

I guess.\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2011/12/2011-in-review-sort-of-i-guess/\r\n---\r\n\r\nSomehow the years seem to fly by more quickly nowadays. They all seem to blend in together too, at least in my memory. When I was thinking of what to write for this post I thought that this was the year I had taken my break from working. That was actually last year.\r\n\r\nI don't think it's a sign that I'm growing old. Maybe more of a sign of the fact that I've settled in to some sort of routine that makes it difficult to tell the days or even years apart. Nothing significant changes, I guess.\r\n\r\nExcept it does. There are changes. This year, I've traveled to new places, met new people, engaged in new activities, worked with some new technology, enjoyed new things. But nothing really life-changing I guess. Or nothing stands out. I wonder if all humans live their lives this way and go through the same ruminations that I do.\r\n\r\nSomething's been going on lately. I've received something of an offer, to try something new and exciting. But it means walking away from the familiar. Taking a risk. There was a time I would have berated myself for even considering not taking on such a new thing. Maybe that time has passed? Like I said, I've fallen into some sort of routine. And heavens help me, maybe I actually enjoy this routine. It's easy, it's stable, it's familiar. Maybe we don't all need to go on some wild adventure always reaching for the stars that may never reach out to us. Maybe we should just be satisfied with the way things are. And the way things are, they're pretty good anyway. Who needs the additional stress?\r\n\r\nMaybe changes and improvements don't have to be some big upfront changes. Maybe they can come slowly and organically, growing out of our daily lives. Maybe change can come little by little everyday, so that you don't even notice it and the years just pass by one after another and then you're someone completely different again. Maybe we let go of the older things one at a time, and pick up the newer things one at a time, until one day we have a completely different set of things. And maybe that's fine.\r\n\r\nWell, it looks like that's how I feel. At least for now. Who knows how I'll wake up tomorrow.\r\n\r\nI harbor no sentimentality for the past year. It's just a year. An arbitrary delineation of time created only as a matter of convention. Time moves forward. We have to keep looking forward, see what the future brings.\r\n\r\nThis existential rambling madness was brought to you by the letter Q. Let's have a good 2012 y'all.",

I'm just a guy with opinions. And you know what they say about opinions... \r\n\r\nToday, the Philippine Senate has impeached the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court by a vote of 20 to 3.\r\n\r\nI've generally kept silent about the CJ trial, mainly because I know people who are rabidly pro-Corona and I don't feel like getting into an argument with someone who's obviously biased (I'm sorry my friends, we are going to have to agree to disagree now). Not to say I dislike him either. I've never met the man, I don't personally know anything about his family. All I know is what I've heard reported in the news, media, etc. I've tried to hold my judgment until the end of the trial.\r\n\r\nFirst: yes, the prosecution was terrible. Rushed impeachment complaint, bringing charges that are near-impossible to prove (\"bias\"? =/) fishing expeditions, \"evidence\" mysteriously appearing given by \"unknown sources\". It's all kinds of shady. To be honest, if the defense had rested their case right after the prosecution finished, they might have gotten a better outcome than this, maybe even won, who knows. The prosecution had next to nothing before the defense made their presentation. All they had were dollar accounts inaccessible to them, and the properties being declared with market value rather than acquisition cost. The defense made so many mistakes, it's facepalm-worthy. Calling a hostile witness to the stand without knowing what she would bring, calling irrelevant witnesses, arguing that the foreign currency act restricted Corona himself from disclosing the dollar accounts; Cuevas (or whoever pushed for it) should be disbarred for even arguing that last one. They really had only one thing they had to explain, the co-mingled funds in the peso account issue. And even that they weren't able to explain, with nothing to back up Corona's explanation: no bank documents, no paper trail, none of the family members testifying that some of the funds were there, nothing!\r\n\r\nThe only things Corona brought with his testimony were ad hominem attacks, appeals to sympathy, appeals to authority and drama. While I don't care if those arguments are presented to the media or via press conferences I couldn't care less, but for the chief justice himself, the head of the judiciary, to be making such arguments in a quasi-legal proceeding? It boggles the mind, to be claiming that the prosecution is bringing forth charges without evidence, when your arguments consist of a conspiracy theory involving an unrelated agrarian reform case and the state of mind of your grandchild. Ugh.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I was already leaning against the CJ the moment he accepted the midnight appointment from Gloria Arroyo. That was a terrible, terrible thing to do. You can say that technically it was legal and the Supreme Court upheld it but whatever. I don't believe that we should be supportive of public servants just because they adhere to the minimum standards set by the law. I believe that with public office being a public trust, public servants should be held to a higher standard than ordinary citizens, even more so those who hold the highest positions in our land. Higher standards of integrity and delicadeza. Public servants should be like caesar's wife: beyond any suspicion.  To accept that midnight appointment, while ruled to be technically legal, while it could not be proven to be for the benefit of GMA, was a terribly unethical decision for someone who should be the epitome of legal ethics. It would have been so easy to say \"No, this is not right, I will not accept this nomination, I will not degrade the position of Chief Justice\" and thus to end his career honorably (possibly even be chosen as the CJ at a later date). But pride, ambition, loyalty, whatever, he still chose to accept it, and it led to his downfall.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of the FCBD act and the SALN law to his benefit is another example, an indicator of a preference of adhering to the letter of the law rather than the spirit of the law; of placing more importance to a law whose purpose was to encourage dollar savings than to a law that promotes transparency and good government. Is that the sort of shining example we want to give to the judiciary, that they should be placing their personal interests above those of the country?\r\n\r\nAnd rushing out of the trial, claiming a low blood sugar attack, conveniently right after he dramatically calls for waivers from his \"political opponents\", then coming back in a wheelchair looking dazed to try to get sympathy (what, there were no sugar sources anywhere in the senate building?). There's no way to disprove the claim or to show it was staged (even though he had time to shake hands with some people on his way out of the courtroom), but you have to wonder if the CJ himself would allow that sort of shenanigans if he was presiding over the court. Not a very good example either.\r\n\r\nThere were very few real winners in this trial, but a clear one has to be the Senate President Juan Ponce Enrile. Despite all the incompetence of the related parties, he did the best job he could, presiding over a very fair trial, calling it straight down the middle down to the very end. Respect.\r\n\r\nAlso, time for a lesson in bad arguments (mostly for internet commenters): \"Let he who is without sin cast the first stone\" -- this is a logical fallacy called \"Tu quoque\", a form of ad hominem. While this is great for bibilical parables, probably not the best argument to cite for legal proceedings. Sure, a whole lot of the accusers themselves are probably corrupt or misdeclaring their SALNs or whatever. Impeach them too. Impeach them all if we have to. (Fortunately for the president, incompetence is not an impeachable offense... yet.)\r\n\r\nThat's my 2 cents. Now can we move on? We still have to prepare for the next circus, it's coming in May 2013.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tu_quoque\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Rocky on 2012-05-29 13:55:18 +0000\r\nGood post, Roy. Mostly agree, especially about the midnight appointment thingie.\r\n\r\nComment by your most loving brother on 2012-05-29 14:55:06 +0000\r\nI also hate that \"Tu Quoque\" argument. Walang sense eh.",

I've always been a Marvel fan more than DC, my previous DC reading having been restricted to JLA and the Batman books, so I figured exposure to the New 52 would widen my appreciation of the DC stable of heroes. Here are my reviews:\r\n\r\nJustice League\r\n\r\nWhile the art is Jim Lee-fantastic, the first story arc left much to be desired. It was basically a meet-and-greet where we're introduced to the team members and after a while they knock Darkseid back down a boom tube. Nothing overly complicated, and it would be okay for an introductory arc if it didn't take six issues to get to that point. (By comparison, Morrison's far more interesting White Martian arc that launched the JLA book in 1997 finished in four issues). The characters aren't particularly fleshed out, which is fine. Justice League books have always been more about the powers and big epic battles than serious characterization, though hopefully Geoff Johns can sneak in something more than a \"Hal Jordan is shallow\" joke every once in a while. They're starting a new story arc with issue #9, and based on the FCBD DC New 52 book, they have a Trinity War story arc coming up next year, so hopefully the book picks up the pace.\r\n\r\nJustice League International\r\n\r\nReading this book feels like watching the animated Justice League Unlimited series. That's where I was first introduced to some of the characters like Fire, Ice, Vixen and Booster Gold. Booster is a great character, and while he doesn't have his own New 52 book, it's nice seeing him take the helm in this one. The art here isn't exceptional and like Justice League the story is more about the powers than the characters but at least the pacing is better than the Justice League book. Guy Gardner's problems with Booster are a nice touch, but it's kind of overkill to have started this book with Batman as part of the team in the main story arc; I'm not sure if Batwing will be taking his place in the team after issue 8.\r\n\r\nAquaman\r\n\r\nIt's nice that the book is really meta about Aquaman's status as a Justice League member, implying he's the butt of jokes even in the actual DC universe. The stories so far have been entertaining, and the characterization of Arthur and Mera have been okay; Johns' writing is better here than in Justice League so far. The art looks nice, though not spectacular. The ongoing \"The Others\" storyline seems to have promise, hopefully we'll see some epic Aquaman arcs. Not sure if I miss the hook from Peter David's days.\r\n\r\nWonder Woman\r\n\r\nThe art style here is weird and unusual, but I kinda like it. The storyline so far has dealt mainly with Greek myth stuff and has made significant changes to Diana's origins linking her more to the Olympus pantheon. It's a good read especially if you're into all the mythological references.\r\n\r\nThe Flash\r\n\r\nBarry Allen is back as the only Flash in the DCnU, though we'll see how long that lasts. The first story arc was ok, showing us some details of how Barry interacts with Iris West and the police, while the second story arc brings us some new details on how The Flash interacts with The Speed Force in the DCnU. The art is okay, I like it a bit better than Aquaman. The only obvious question at the moment is: where is Wally West?\r\n\r\nCaptain Atom\r\n\r\nSo far the art on this book hasn't been very appealing to me. The story line is a lot of \"oh no, I'm having trouble controlling my powers and the norms don't trust me\". I'm not sure what his range of powers were pre-New 52, but the way it's described here he's basically able to do anything, including time travel, matter transformation, etc. Anything except FIND LOVE. The book is meh, I wouldn't mind losing it.\r\n\r\nThe Fury of Firestorm\r\n\r\nI seem to remember that there was a previous Firestorm incarnation where it was two people trapped in the same body. It's different this time around, they have two teenagers who are both Firestorms, each with a different power set. (Only one of them can do transmutation, et cetera). Additionally, they can combine into a bigger, badder Firestorm! Also, other countries have Firestorms too, albeit most are flawed versions. Firestorms seem to be kinda like nukes here. The art is nothing to write home about. The book is ok I guess.\r\n\r\nGreen Arrow\r\n\r\nUgh, the art is mediocre and the storylines are uninteresting and feel unnecessarily convoluted, especially the latest one. Oliver Queen here is shallow and uninteresting, playing out the lazy heir to a fortune while secretly fighting crime in a costume. I think we already have one of those (Batman, and he's already pretty overexposed), so Green Arrow needs some way to differentiate himself. So far he hasn't shown any of the grit or social consciousness that was characteristic of the previous incarnation.\r\n\r\nThe Savage Hawkman\r\n\r\nThe art here is a bit unusual, but I kind of like it. The storyline revolves around Carter Hall and his archaeological pals accidentally unleashing some sort of evil alien that had previously been trapped on Earth. There's some changes to his powers as well, as the Nth metal which enables him being Hawkman is now &#8216;bonded' to his body such that he can transform into Hawkman at will (sort of like how Iron Man's current armor is just nanomachines in his body). Well okay, I'm not exactly sure how the previous incarnations worked, but my impression was that the Nth metal was just a harness he put on. It's still unknown how Carter Hall in this universe is related to Katar Hol, the Thanagarian who was previously Hawkman, or whether we're going to see Hawkgirl/Shayera anytime soon, but this series has potential.\r\n\r\nOk, I can't do everything all in one post, so let's save some for later. For the curious, I'm doing these in Wikipedia order, which means the Batman family will be in part 2.\r\n\r",

Part is here. Hopefully I finish this series before the reviews become too out of date.\r\n\r\nBatman\r\n\r\nI decided to read every book of the New 52 to widen my horizons regarding my comic book reading, and one of the greatest advantages has been exposure to Scott Snyder's work. I have a tendency not to remember writers and artists of comics I read, except for the very famous ones, so I wasn't aware that I had read his work before during the Black Mirror arc in Detective Comics pre-New 52. But he's quickly become one of my favorite writers to date, with his work on Batman quickly bringing me to appreciate his work on other books like Swamp Thing and the phenomenal American Vampire. His writing on Batman is up there with those other books. He's introduced a whole new mythos and underbelly to Gotham, adding a new dimension to Batman's fight to keep his city sane. And the artwork by Greg Capullo  is simply fantastic, an awesome backup to Snyder's plots. Capullo is another creative whom I wouldn't have encountered if not for the New 52, his work previously been mostly Image-related. The excellent creative team easily makes Batman my favorite of the DC New 52 so far (it helps that I'm quite the Batman fan.)\r\n\r\nDetective Comics\r\n\r\nDetective isn't the best, but that's okay. The art is above average, I kinda like it, though it smells a bit like the usual gritty comic-book art I've grown up with. The story lines so far have involved the Dollmaker and the Penguin, and they involve a lot of Batman knocking around thugs to get information. The stories are always narrated in Batman's third person voice which gives it a weird edge. Not sure what's the final fate of the Joker, based on what happened to him at the start of the book. The book is promising, but needs to show something excellent to gain attention. Still, it's not like DC's gonna cut the titular Detective Comics, so neither am I.\r\n\r\nBatman: The Dark Knight\r\n\r\nBatman seems to be the Wolverine of DC Comics: he has a lot of his own books, and he even makes appearances in other books to help shore up their popularity (see: Hawk and Dove, I Vampire) . As a Batman fan I'm glad to read more Bat-stories, but the character might just be stretched a little bit too thin. And if we had to cut one Batman book from the New 52, I'd choose this one (we certainly can't cut any of the other three). Batman: The Dark Knight&#8216;s storyline so far has involved a mysterious white rabbit and a hodgepodge of Batman's enemies escaped from the asylum. Seriously, there's a new one every issue: Two-Face in #2, Clayface as  Joker in #3, Deathstroke in #4, Scarecrow in #5, Venom in #6 and #7, Mad Hatter in #8. Then there's the cameos by Flash, Superman and Wonder Woman. It's like the writer finally got to his dream of drawing Batman and just wants to play with all the characters he can use. It's not really a bad thing, but I'd appreciate more story arcs that didn't just involve Batman punching a new supervillain every month. The art is so-so and reminds me of every guy who ever graduated from the Kubert school. The style is very much the same. The book is ok, I'd keep reading it if it were around, but probably wouldn't miss it if they cut it.\r\n\r\nBatman and Robin\r\n\r\nWhat makes the current combination of Batman and Robin interesting is that unlike Bruce's relationship with the previous Robins Dick and Tim (and even Jason) where having a partner was seen to improve Batman's temperament and bring a lighter side to the superhero team, in Damian's case he's very much as grim as his father what with the whole being raised by assassins bit. And we get exactly what we can expect -- Bruce trying to teach Damian how to become a better person despite his upbringing and despite forces around them trying to bring Damian down into the dark side. The art is a bit uneven but it works, and the book is well worth the read.\r\n\r\nBatgirl\r\n\r\nIt was a bit controversial when they revealed Barbara Gordon would be getting her legs back with the reboot. Oracle had been a staple of the Batman family for so long that fans would surely miss her, not to mention the fans of previous Batgirls Cass Cain and Stephanie Brown (neither of which have been seen in action in the New 52). While the events of The Killing Joke haven't been retconned away (Barbara explicitly recalls the shooting incident in several flashbacks), they haven't explained yet as of this writing the \"miracle\" that gave Barbara back the use of her legs. The current storylines haven't been particularly exciting; I think I enjoyed Stephanie's schoolgirl problems more, but they're entertaining enough I suppose. The art is okay, if not a bit too shiny. Will continue reading.\r\n\r\nBatwing\r\n\r\nI like Batwing if only for the fact that a superhero from Africa has his own titular book. Most of the first story arc (which spans the first eight books) takes place in Africa and delves into the history of superheroes on that continent. It also shows a bit of what life is like under the grip of African warlords. The exposure to something non-American is nice, although the story arc manages to drag itself over to Gotham for the finale (and it looks like Batwing is going to become part of Justice League International&#8216;s roster). The art style is crisp, unique and refreshing, I approve of this book.\r\n\r\nBatwoman\r\n\r\nI really like the artwork here and the panel layouts. They all feel so crisp and I love paging through them. The stories are okay, except that they don't put enough effort towards the accessibility of the character. I've read some of Batwoman's history before so I know a bit what she's about, but this book mostly just dives straight in and expects the reader to \"get it\". It's nice that Batwoman doesn't end up as one of Batman's \"formal\" allies. Instead she ends up working with a certain government agency. (This book is also not part of the Night of Owls crossover I think). However, I find some story details a bit tough to follow, not sure if it's because of the unusual layouts or the lack of introductory detail -- I find myself having to read each issue one more time to get most of the details. They're usually worth it though, and this is a book I'm going to keep following.\r\n\r\nNightwing\r\n\r\nThe story arcs so far dig into Dick's background with the Haly Circus, something I haven't been too familiar with before. Near the end of the first eight books it ties in to the Batman Court of Owls storyline, adding a deeper back story to Haly's Circus than previous story lines had shown. The book is interesting and the art is okay, though it's not one of the titles I feel like I have to read immediately.\r\n\r\nCatwoman\r\n\r\nThis book has trouble keeping my interest. It's mostly Catwoman getting into thieving hijinks (and occasionally having sex with the Batman). Well, at least the story gives us a different perspective of life on Gotham's streets. The art isn't spectacular, but it's not bad. I'll probably keep reading it, at lower priority.\r\n\r\nBirds of Prey\r\n\r\nI've never read the previous Birds of Prey series, so I'm not sure how this compares, but the book is interesting enough. I like the team's variety -- there's one of Batman's archvillains here, Black Canary is always cool, I'm not entirely sure Katana is sane, and I like the way Starling handles things. The art is passable, though not really standing out for me. No reason to drop this title.\r\n\r\nRed Hood and the Outlaws\r\n\r\nThis series kicked off with a bit of controversy regarding the mangling of Starfire's character. In fact it confused me a bit with Starfire's vague recollections of being with Dick Grayson; I'm not sure whether the New Teen Titans era exists in the New 52 (the Teen Titans book seems to imply that the New 52 incarnation is the first one). Despite the problems with Starfire's characterizations, I've found the stories so far pretty interesting. The plots mostly delves into Jason Todd's background and what happened to him between the time he was brought back by the League of Assassins and when he resurfaced as the Red Hood. The art is pretty good, it's probably one of my favorite in the entire New 52. It's nice and shiny and not too conventional. This is one of the books I read immediately when it comes out.\r\n\r\nUgh, these reviews are taking longer to write than I thought. Next up: Superman and Green Lantern.\r\n\r",

I don't really consider myself a \"regular\" Magic player anymore so I'm not going to give a full tournament report, though I will record some details for posterity.\r\n\r\nLet's start with the deck. I played some version of Naya Pod, limited by what cards were available as usual:\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist title=\"A Pile of Naya\" }}\r\n  \r\n[Creatures]\r\n  \r\n4 Birds of Paradise\r\n  \r\n3 Avacyn Pilgrim\r\n  \r\n1 Ulvenwald Tracker\r\n  \r\n4 Strangeleroot Geist\r\n  \r\n2 Thalia, Guardian of Thraben\r\n  \r\n1 Daybreak Ranger\r\n  \r\n2 Borderland Ranger\r\n  \r\n2 Blade Splicer\r\n  \r\n2 Fiend Hunter\r\n  \r\n2 Wolfir Avenger\r\n  \r\n1 Phyrexian Metamorph\r\n  \r\n2 Hero of Bladehold\r\n  \r\n2 Huntmaster of the Fells\r\n  \r\n3 Restoration Angel\r\n  \r\n1 Oxida Scrapmelter\r\n  \r\n1 Acidic Slime\r\n  \r\n[/Creatures]\r\n  \r\n[Spells]\r\n  \r\n2 Birthing Pod\r\n  \r\n1 Bonfire of the Damned\r\n  \r\n[/Spells]\r\n  \r\n[Lands]\r\n  \r\n4 Copperline Gorge\r\n  \r\n4 Razorverge Thicket\r\n  \r\n3 Sunpetal Grove\r\n  \r\n2 Rootbound Crag\r\n  \r\n2 Gavony Township\r\n  \r\n1 Slayer Stronghold\r\n  \r\n2 Cavern of Souls\r\n  \r\n4 Forest\r\n  \r\n1 Mountain\r\n  \r\n1 Plains\r\n  \r\n[/Lands]\r\n  \r\n[Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n1 Ancient Grudge\r\n  \r\n2 Ray of Revelation\r\n  \r\n1 Zealous Conscripts\r\n  \r\n2 Garruk Relentless\r\n  \r\n2 Celestial Purge\r\n  \r\n3 Thunderbolt\r\n  \r\n2 Arc Trail\r\n  \r\n1 Surgical Extraction\r\n  \r\n1 Oblivion Ring\r\n  \r\n[/Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\nIt's a pretty straightforward deck, what with the turning guys sideways and all. And the round by round results:\r\n\r\n1 BR Zombies WIN 2-1\r\n2 UW Humans WIN 2-0\r\n3 Gb Pod WIN 2-0\r\n4 UW Delver LOSS 0-2\r\n5 Frites WIN 2-1\r\n6 RG Ramp LOSS 1-2\r\n7 Wb Tokens WIN 2-0\r\n8 UG Infect WIN 2-0\r\n9 RG Ramp WIN 2-0\r\n10 Pike Delver WIN 2-0\r\n11 Delverless Delver LOSS 1-2\r\n12 Sun Titan Delver LOSS 1-2\r\n13 Some Delver WIN 2-0\r\n14 Spectral Flight Delver WIN 2-1\r\n15 Solar Flare WIN 2-1\r\n\r\nAs can be seen above, I made day 2 for the first time, and I believe this is already my sixth Grand Prix. I finished 11 and 4, which was good enough for 39th place despite my pretty bad tiebreaks. This means I finished in the money, hooray! Feels good to have a decent finish after playing this game for what, seventeen years now? Playing in Day 2 was great, the tables weren't as crowded as Day One! Hah. I still made a lot of bad plays though, I mostly got lucky with a lot of my wins. With tighter play I might have gone as good as 13-2.figure style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg title=\"My finish\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-nOZlY4k8DC8/T99O13bdziI/AAAAAAAAAOU/t5RzS6Rhafo/s720/IMG20120617155930.jpg\" alt=\"My finish\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"39th!/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nAside from the main event, another thing I participated in during the second day was the Magic Rules Challenge! This was a fun thing they had where they set up a booth manned by a couple of judges. You could go up to them (no entrance fee) and answer up to three rules questions in a row. If you get questions right, you get foil cards! Well, the foil cards I won weren't very useful or valuable, but I had a lot of fun with the rules questions themselves, I really enjoy that stuff. I'd hang out there between rounds not only to join but also to watch other people play. The questions ranged in difficulty from quite easy (\"You play {{ card }}Grim Lavamancer{{ /card }}'s activated ability and your opponent uses {{ card }}Tormod's Crypt{{ /card }}, how much damage is dealt?\") to an actual layers + {{ card }}Humility{{ /card }} question! It was a nice relaxing change of pace to play between rounds to take some pressure off.figure style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg title=\"My crappy foil winnings from the Magic Rules Challenge\" src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-NEifeaklwiU/T-CgiPLMfHI/AAAAAAAAAOg/MXDnqpjQZyo/s720/IMG20120619235315.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"720\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"My crappy foil winnings from the Magic Rules Challenge/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nThe weekend was exhausting, especially the nine rounds on the first day and the needing to travel back and forth to MOA, but it was a fun experience and definitely worth it (not sure if I'd say that if I didn't place haha).

And many of them don't deserve much comments, so I'll just go through the rest quickly or I might never finish.\r\n\r\nAction Comics -- the younger Superman stories are interesting, but occasionally Morrison goes off on one of his weird tangent stories. Superman's early years are largely re-written, and that's understandable, he's never had particularly interesting events in his history anyway\r\n  \r\nSuperman -- meh, needs more spice\r\n  \r\nSuperboy -- interesting, but the character has yet to find a status quo\r\n  \r\nSupergirl -- interesting, but the character has yet to find a status quo\r\n\r\nGreen Lantern -- interesting, though it implies Hal is currently a GL in the league with a \"fake\" power ring. Most of the GL history seems to be intact, and the GL books are all leading towards some sort of \"third army\" event, I hope it happens soon.\r\n  \r\nGreen Lantern Corps -- interesting enough for me to want to read it before AvX #6 this week\r\n  \r\nGreen Lantern: New Guardians -- interesting, but I don't see where this is going. Is it possible for Raynier's \"Rainbow Guardians\" to become a real team?\r\n  \r\nRed Lanterns -- mildly interesting, but I don't see where this is going. I'm not convinced the Reds were the best corps to give their own series\r\n\r\nTeen Titans -- interesting for me, but only because Red Robin is here. The team's \"coming together adventure\" has been going on for far too long and they need to reach some sort of status quo\r\n  \r\nBlue Beetle -- interesting, but the character has yet to find a status quo\r\n  \r\nLegion of Super-Heroes -- interesting storylines, but way too many characters, not very accessible\r\n  \r\nLegion Lost -- interesting, but they can't get back to their own time without changing the book title, so it kinda limits what's going to happen and makes them always on the run\r\n\r\nAll-Star Western -- interesting, but weird. Not really a superhero book, though it has ties to Gotham City. I'm not particularly interested in the backup stories though\r\n  \r\nDeathstroke -- not interesting, seems to be mostly just Slade killing a bunch of guys for one reason or another. I'm not confident about it with Liefeld coming on, but I'll probably still read it for a while since I can't resist a  train wreck\r\n  \r\nSuicide Squad -- meh, the squad composition at the moment isn't very interesting, the only real personalities there are Deadshot and Harley (at least they're giving her something to do aside from being a Joker fangirl)\r\n  \r\nStormwatch -- mildly interesting, if only because they're going to need to be fighting the JL at some point. Some of their science-y explanations are ridiculous though\r\n  \r\nGrifter -- meh, doesn't seem to be going anywhere serious.\r\n  \r\nVoodoo -- meh, not sure where it's going. Also, with all this Daemonite activity going on, how is it Stormwatch isn't seriously cracking down on them?\r\n  \r\nResurrection Man -- I like the concept, but the storyline seems to be going nowhere serious\r\n  \r\nMan O War -- I tried to bear with this, but it just bored me. I only managed to read up to issue 7\r\n\r\nJustice League Dark -- interesting, though they're not really a real \"team\" at the moment. But the team composition is solid, especially they dropped Shade who wasn't really doing anything for the book. Andrew Bennet seems a better fit\r\n  \r\nSwamp Thing -- interesting, but might be a bit too weird for some, since a lot of the book feels like Alec Holland being on an acid trip of some sort. Feels very Vertigo.\r\n  \r\nAnimal Man -- see Swamp Thing. Art is pretty good, but still weird.\r\n  \r\nFrankenstein, Agent of SHADE -- interesting enough. Art is...  unique.\r\n  \r\nI, Vampire -- surprisingly interesting, even if I'm already reading another Vampire series (American Vampire). Curious to see where it goes.\r\n  \r\nDemon Knights -- surprisingly interesting, the team composition is nice and varied (Vandal Savage, wut) and the storylines are a fresh reprieve from superhero stuff\r\n\r\nDC Comics Presents -- Deadman was ok, Challengers less interesting for me. Good series for them to keep around and showcase lesser-known characters\r\n\r\nAnd the second wave of the New 52, of which we are only one or two issues in:\r\n  \r\nBatman Incorporated -- looking good, easily better than both Detective and Dark Knight\r\n  \r\nEarth 2 -- the second issue was a bit slow, but it looks interesting enough\r\n  \r\nWorlds' Finest -- the first issue wasn't the best, but I like the idea of this comic so I'll keep reading it\r\n  \r\nDial H -- off to a good start, but I can't help but wonder whether they'll be running out of hero ideas at some point. Also, Pelican Army!\r\n  \r\nGI Combat -- okay, I didn't like the last war book, I'm not gonna bother with this one.\r\n  \r\nThe Ravagers -- giving this a shot, although at the moment it just seems like another \"bunch of super teens on the run from evil forces\" kinda deal, and that's already what Teen Titans is doing at the moment.\r\n\r\nI'm probably going to keep on reading a good 70-80% of the books going forward, I don't feel compelled to read every single one of them any more. It's still a good chunk of books to read, and makes me look forward to the new releases every week.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2012/05/the-dc-new-52-review-part-1/\r",

I randomly think of things to write about while I'm idling or commuting or waiting in line or any of the dozen or so other opportunities during the day when my mind wanders, but because of laziness and/or lack of discipline, these ideas never get very far. I think one of the problems is that because this is a personal blog, I don't have any focus. That is, in this space I can literally write about anything I want so I end up not writing anything. Does that make sense?\r\n\r\nAnyway what I decided was: I'll just start a new blog. What the hell right? But this time, I'll focus on a topic for the blog. Restrictions breed creativity, or something. I needed to choose a topic that (a) I was fairly knowledgeable and passionate about; and (b) I would have something regarding that topic to write about on a regular basis. I've actually tried this before for Magic the Gathering, since I pretty much enjoy that game a lot, but the problem with MTG was that I was an irregular player and rarely had something new to write about. So I'm going to choose something else right now.\r\n\r\nThe easiest area that covers the above requirements for me right now is easily reading comic books. I read a ton of them and I enjoy them and I follow the regular weekly releases and am usually excited for the next week of releases. So it seems like something I would be able to write regularly about. So, here we go: a href=\"http://ireadcomicbooks.com/\" target=\"_blank\"I Read Comic Books/a (originally I was just going to go with a wordpress.com site, but I was like aw what the hell, domains are cheap)\r\n\r\nHopefully it helps me get into the groove of regular writing, and somehow that groove propagates back to this blog.",

Mesa.\" He offered to drop the flag-down fee from the fare so I just agreed. I got off and looked around.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons I agreed to let him off despite the late hour was that I knew the place where we were passing by -- a well lit area where I could easily get another taxi or take an alternative form of transportation if needed -- it was the neighborhood I grew up in. And by some happenstance the exact spot where I got off was right across the corner near my grandparents' old house where we used to live ten-odd years ago. No more than thirty to forty meters away was where most of my childhood took place.\r\n\r\nI look down the road and there's already another taxi coming down the stretch. I could hail it and be on my way home. But I looked across the street and considered the alternative. A quick trip down memory lane wouldn't hurt right? I've been by this road before since we moved, many times even, since it was one of my common taxi routes home. Sometimes I even passed right by where the house used to be. But it was always in passing, I've never gone there simply to take a look and remember what used to be.\r\n\r\nThe taxi passes by, and I'm crossing the street. There's a Mercury Drug here now at the corner, it didn't used to be there. I try to remember what used to be on this curved corner even though I must have walked by it a thousand times. It was probably some residence, neighbors I never really knew.\r\n\r\nI turn right after crossing the street and down the sloped street. On the other side of the street, there was this building with a truck in front and a familiar side door. The family who lived there sold ice out of that door and when I was young I would sometimes be sent out to buy ice for our sari-sari store from that door. It was only a short walk away and I would earn a crisp five-peso bill for my efforts. That five pesos was a lot for me back then, enough to buy a small coke with. Yes, we had a sari-sari store at our grandparents' house when we were young, which meant I drank a lot of soft drinks back then.\r\n\r\nA few meters later and I'm at the fork in the road in front of where the house used to be. There used to be a basketball board and hoop set up in the middle of the fork, but that had already been taken down before we moved. Now there was just a pillar with the names of the local officials (epals) and a sign that declared it was illegal to park in that spot.\r\n\r\nOur grandparents' house was pretty big back then -- there were three families of relatives living there (counting ours) and as mentioned we also had a sari-sari store that catered to neighbors. More than a decade ago the family decided to sell it off and move to separate houses. It had since been replaced by a set of three townhouses, the usual size for residential areas nowadays. The townhouse gates were right against the street with no room to sit outside the gate or anything. I remembered our old house had a small area in front where we could stand around and watch cars pass by, plus a small elevated platform to the side where we often sat as kids. That was just outside our very low security gate (By the time I was twelve I could reach over the gate and open it from the other side)\r\n\r\nThe neighboring house on the right side was also gone, replaced by townhouses as well. That house -- compound, really -- used to be lived in by this guy who drove a blue jeepney. I never knew that family's name but more than once I had ridden in that jeepney and the driver recognized me and insisted that I didn't have to pay. Sometimes at night when the jeepney was parked outside their house we would sit inside the jeepney, sometimes at the driver's seat pretending to drive.\r\n\r\nI walked a bit past where the house used to be and saw the neighbor's gate on the other side -- I think it was still the same neighbor. I couldn't be too sure since my memories are a bit hazy and I wasn't really familiar with our neighbors but it looked like most of the houses down that part had stayed the same. I turned back for the fork.\r\n\r\nAcross the street from where the house used to be, I remembered there being a wide house with two gates. During the times when there were often power failures in our area, we were always envious of that house across the street because they always had power whenever we lost ours. That house was no longer there either, replaced with a smaller townhouse and a larger four or five story building.\r\n\r\nI had back up the street and down the main road in front of the Mercury Drug and cross back to where the taxi had dropped me off. That side had a different set of shops that I remember, but there was still that small hole-in-the-wall barbershop where my dad would take us for haircuts. Our favorite barber was this small guy who was always smiling but I don't even remember his name right now.\r\n\r\nI looked back to the other side of the street and saw the police station a few meters away from the Mercury Drug. That police station used to be a small and simple one-story affair. Now it was a well-polished two-story building and it had what looked like new police cars parked just outside. There used to be a small side street beside the police station which led between the houses back to the fork in the road, and when we were kids we often went down that pass as a \"shortcut\". I don't think it was ever really faster to take that route but as a kid you often found enjoyment in just passing down a different route.\r\n\r\nI walked a few meters away from the Mercury Drug towards the next corner. On that corner there used to be a shop that would rent out betamax and VHS movies. They also had Family Computers for rent that my brother and I would sometimes play at on weekends. Even though we had a NES at home, that shop had games we didn't have and I had my first encounter with a romhack here (though I didn't know it at the time) when we played a cartridge that claimed to be Super Mario Brothers 4. The shop was no longer there, I believe it had closed up years before we moved. The corner was now occupied by a small carinderia but with the same name as the old shop. probably owned by the same people.\r\n\r\nI thought about walking a bit farther down the road because I knew the bakery was still there. It was an old bakery, as far as I can tell it had been there for more than thirty years now, surely nothing to scoff at. We used to buy pandesal _there in the mornings for as long as I could remember. I thought about buying some right then and there just for nostalgia sake but as I recalled their best _pandesal was when you bought it at five in the morning.\r\n\r\nBy that point I was satisfied with my unscheduled trip down memory lane. I stood there for a few minutes trying to see if I could get a jeepney ride, but the jeepneys running the route I had to take where all full despite the late hour -- that hasn't changed in more than a decade. Eventually I gave up and just hailed another cab. We drove away back towards the present, leaving the past behind\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Kay Javier on 2013-02-09 20:00:52 +0000\r\nAya, you made me smile while reading this...  it's a good feeling remembering good old happy days. 🙂 Ice store Mejia...  across was construction supply store hehe... . 🙂",

The guard had lazily pointed us to a large open door near the back of the building. The interior was a studio-type area and there was a group of three women dressed in white who had arrived ahead of us and we followed them up a narrow set of stairs to an elevated lounge area with chairs and tables. We recognized some of the faces already there so we knew we were in the right place. No, we weren't there for some illicit meetup of any sort; we were there to participate in something a bit more geeky. We were here for a quiz night.\r\n\r\nQuiz nights (or pub quizzes, as they're known in Britain) at their heart are simple affairs. You get a bunch of friends to form a team and you go to the event venue for a night of answering questions on various topics, competing with other teams. There's usually food and alcohol involved too. This particular quiz night we were attending was Geekfight, a monthly event which was coming back from a three-month hiatus. Their questions usually revolved around pop culture and traditionally geeky exploits. That means you knowledge of the minutiae of movies, TV shows, comic books and other such channels of geek culture.\r\n\r\nWe've arrived early since we didn't know where the venue was and didn't want to get lost. Aside from the organizers we are the only team already present. We jokingly said that maybe that meant we could win the event for once. I've been participating in quiz nights for more than three years now by my reckoning, but we've never finished first, the closest being a previous Geekfight where we tied for first place and I dropped the crucial tiebreaker question.\r\n\r\nWe're looking to change that tonight though. Each quiz night is usually divided into several rounds of questions, with each round following a certain category of questions. For Geekfight, the categories are announced ahead of time so we know that tonight's questions will be all about movies and we figure we have a solid chance. Two more of our group arrive so that we hit the Geekfight maximum of six members per team. We order some pizza from the pizzeria out front since the venue doesn't serve food.\r\n\r\nThe place starts to fill in with other teams just as we're finishing our pizza, though we don't really mingle. \"I feel like a lot of the people here know each other except for us,\" one of us jokes, which starts a healthy discussion on our being introverts and our Myers-Briggs classifications. Still, we recognize many of the teams and attendees by face and by team name, and a few by name. A number of these players and teams also attend another of our regular haunts: quiz nights at Amici Greenhills which is held every first Thursday of the month. Amici's question set is a bit wider and less involved with details as compared to Geekfight but still focused on pop culture, and the food is usually much better.\r\n\r\nIt takes a while before all the teams are assembled (probably had the same trouble as us finding the place) so the event starts off a bit later than the 9pm call time. The organizers have a projector set up to show slides against the far side of the room. The host (a guy who looks like one of our ex-officemates) calls out the rules and categories. Each team is approached by a scorer and is given a small whiteboard and a marker to use to show their answers. The host is going to call out each question as they appear on the slides and give the teams some time usually around 30 seconds to scrawl an answer onto their boards. After some time the host counts down from 5 then asks the team to raise their boards. The host will then call out each answer (or not, depending on how lazy he's feeling) before going to the next slide to show the answer. Each round will have ten such questions.\r\n\r\n*Rounds one and two. *The event kicks off with a round on Sports Movies which gets us scratching our head over questions such as what team Tidwell played for in Jerry Maguire a href=\"#a1\" name=\"q1\"[1]/a and what Kevin Bacon movie has him recruiting basketball players in Africa a href=\"#a2\" name=\"q2\"[2]/a. Halfway through the round I predict that we're going to get a Dodgeball question and sure enough the very next slide asks us to name the gym opposite Average Joe's in that movie a href=\"#a3\" name=\"q3\"[3]/a. The second round is on Science Fiction movies which leads to me struggling to remember the name of Emmet Brown's dog in the year 1955 in the movie Back to the Future a href=\"#a4\" name=\"q4\"[4]/a (it's not Einstein!) and the technical name for the liquid metal that composed the T-1000 in Terminator 2: Judgement Day a href=\"#a5\" name=\"q5\"[5]/a\r\n\r\nUnlike Geekfight and Amici which focus more on pop-culture topics, the first time we went to a quiz night was at a venue that tended towards more academic subjects -- which was how we found out about our team's unfortunate weakness to geography and history questions. That was at the first establishment to start running quiz nights in Metro Manila: Murphy's, an Irish pub in Makati which still runs their quiz nights weekly every Tuesdays. It's still pretty fun and challenging, so we still go there every few weeks or so, but the best our group has done there was third place.\r\n\r\n*Rounds three and four. *Geekfight continued with a round on Gangster Movies, which sees us naming the lead character in Scarface a href=\"#a6\" name=\"q6\"[6]/a trying to guess the two leads of the 1976 movie Bitayin si Baby Ama a href=\"#a7\" name=\"q7\"[7]/a and luckily one of knows the name of the movie where Brad Pitt plays famous outlaw Jesse James a href=\"#a8\" name=\"q8\"[8]/a.\r\n\r\nThe next round was a picture round, each slide showed a scene from a movie and we were to identify both the name of the place and the movie it appeared in (2 points each slide, so this round was worth twice as much as others!). The first question was a scene from the local movie Ang Nawawala _which by coincidence some of the people who worked on it were at Geekfight that night! When we were shown a shot of Luke Skywalker leaving behind his dead Uncle and Aunt, I wanted to write \"Lars Water Farm\" or something like that instead of Tatooine and it turns out that we did indeed have to be more specific (part of quiz night is knowing when to override your team!) I felt a bit redeemed later when I successfully named the Firehouse from _Ghostbusters.\r\n\r\n*Breaktime! *After the first four rounds, it was halftime. We scored 26 points (out of a possible 50), which left us a sixth place out of 16 teams. Not bad, but certainly not good enough, we had to step it up. We took some time to vote on a category to joker. The joker was a common feature of the local quiz nights; it basically meant that each team gets to choose the category they're most confident in and the team would earn double points for that particular category. Before my vote, it was split between Animated Movies and Rom-coms I just went with Rom-coms.\r\n\r\n*Rounds five and six. *Rom-coms happened to be the very next round too! We had to think about who played the lead roles in the remake of the Humphrey Bogart and Audrey Hepburn film Sabrina a href=\"#a9\" name=\"q9\"[9]/a and we had to fill in the When Harry Met Sally quote \"Waiter, there is too much pepper on my [blank]. But I would be proud to partake of your [blank]\" a href=\"#a10\" name=\"q10\"[10]/a. We did fairly well in the joker round, only slightly worse than our best round which was the next round on War movies. The War movies round has us naming the ships in Master and Commander: Far Side of the World a href=\"#a11\" name=\"q11\"[11]/a and failing to identify the Oliver Stone war movie filmed in the Philippines a href=\"#a12\" name=\"q12\"[12]/a\r\n\r\n*Rounds seven and eight. *The last two rounds were good for us so we just have to do well in the last two rounds (Fantasy and Animated Films). Shouldn't be too hard right? You'd think so. The fantasy round had questions on old fantasy films we hadn't seen such as Willow and recent films we weren't fond of like Kingdom of Heaven. The animated round featured questions like who voiced Wreck-gar in the 1986 Transformers movie a href=\"#a13\" name=\"q13\"[13]/a and what was the name of the kart racing gaming in Wreck-It-Ralph a href=\"#a14\" name=\"q14\"[14]/a alongside questions on stuff we hadn't seen like an obscure animated short that won some Oscar and a picture question asking us to identify which movie a character came from (we didn't get the answer; it was, embarrassingly enough, The Little Mermaid.)\r\n\r\n*Wrapping up. *When all the rounds were done, we had score 29 points in the second half, with only one team scoring more points than us (30) in the second half. When we perform badly, we usually don't bother waiting for the final rankings to be called out, but I felt like there was an outside chance of us actually winning here since most of the top scores were clustered together. It turns out that we finished with 55 points, just below the fifth-place team with 57 points, so it was the same rank we had in the first half. =/ Interestingly, the 1st and 2nd placers are tied, as are the 3rd and 4th placers, so an additional tie break question had to be done. (I've been there before!)\r\n\r\nAh well, we're used to not winning anyway. Yet we still keep coming back to quiz nights, Geekfight and Amici and Murphy's. We enjoy the challenge I guess, and we love digging deep trying to find the answers to those trivia questions. Yes, we enjoy it even when we have trouble figuring them out. But next time we're going to win for sure! (Or so I keep telling myself)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis might be the longest post I've ever written.

For a while now I've been wanting to write a blog post about that and several other election-related thoughts. I've decided to present these thoughts it as a fictional chat between made-up characters. Totally fictional characters. Any resemblance to actual people living or dead = pure coincidence. em style=\"font-size: smaller; color: gray;\"(Although if you must try to imagine these characters, you can imagine jaeger as a dashing idealist, in-in as a cynical pragmatist, ORYLY as a carefree vagabond and Scrappy coco as someone who just wandered into the wrong room.)/em\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\np class=\"c4\"\r\n  span

But take a look at the number of decisions that have to be made when you go vote in an election (let's say it's also a presidential election so that we have a complete view):\r\n\r\n  You need to choose a president out of maybe 6-8 candidates\r\n  You need to choose a vice president out of maybe 6-8 candidates\r\n  You need to choose 12 senators from a pool of 20-30 or more candidates\r\n  You need to choose a congressman from maybe 4-6 candidates\r\n  You need to choose a governor (I'm from Metro Manila, we don't have a guvnor so I'm just guessing here) from maybe 3-5 candidates\r\n  You need to choose a mayor from maybe 3-5 candidates\r\n  You need to choose a vice mayor from maybe 3-5 candidates\r\n  You need to choose god knows how many councilors (I seriously have no idea, is it 6?) from who knows how many candidates\r\n  You need to choose a party-list from over a hundred choices\r\n\r\nIn order to \"vote wisely\", for each of those choices, you'd need to have some idea of who they are, what their background is, what their advocacies are, what their stand is on the issues, what bills they have pushed/sponsored/passed (if they had previous legislative experience), etc. For all of those candidates! I live a comfortable life and have a reasonable amount of free time and even I don't want to do that! Not to mention that unlike me, a very, very large percentage of the voting population don't have easily available internet access so that they can do their own research on candidates' backgrounds. They're not on Facebook all the time reading about Nancy's shenanigans or how Jack Enrile doesn't want you to look closely at a murder rap in his history. They're too busy with more mundane everyday concerns like how to earn money, where they're going to get food to feed their large families, etc. They just don't have the time, inclination or opportunity to soak up all the relevant information that would let them make an informed choice.\r\n\r\nSo what do they do, they do what any regular, sane person does when faced with an overwhelming amount of information, they use filters. But their filters are silly things like survey results (\"Other people think this candidate is okay, so I guess I can vote for him\"), celebrity endorsements (it's sad that former Sen. Jun Magsaysay only got a bump in survey results when he got Sir Chief to endorse him) or worse things like bribery, vote buying through giveaways, etc.\r\n\r\nWhat am I saying, what am I talking about? All this time I've been harping about how voter education is important, but how it's delivered needs to be thought about. We can't just flood people with information, they're just going to be overwhelmed and the silly yet simpler things like inane political ads are going to win out. We need to, I dunno, find a way to provide better, easier filters for people. I don't know how, I'm not that smart. Not yet.\r\n\r\n\"But Roy,\" I can hear you objecting already, \"elections are serious business deciding the future of our country! It's important, and they should take it seriously and think very hard about their choices!\" You're absolutely right that it's important, but the problem is that for a vast majority of poor people, they have a lot of other more important, more urgent things to worry about. Elections affect what happens to our country three, five, ten years down the road, but a lot of people have trouble figuring out how they're going to get through the next day. The feedback loop for getting results from elections is just too long for people to take it seriously. Now, we can suggest that maybe, just maybe, we can just ask those people not to vote if they're not going to take it seriously? Maybe, but that's hardly enforceable in any reasonable way. And you're going to get accused of being anti-democracy or whatever.\r\n\r\n\"It has been said that democracy is the worst form of government except all the others that have been tried.\" -- William Churchill.\r\n\r\nI don't have a solution, I'm just rambling. Maybe this is really how it's supposed to work, democracy? We live with what the people choose, even if they're bad choices. Democracy is very effective at a small scale (\"Guys let's vote on where we should have dinner!\") but I feel like the logistics of it all gets way way more difficult as we scale up to the level of an entire country. Maybe smarter people than me have proposed solutions, I dunno, comment and give me links if you know of them. Who are the best democracies in the world and how do they get away with it? Certainly not the United States with their two-party system and their lobbyists and what not.\r\n\r\nAlthough now that I think about it, it might help if we reduce the number of choices that would need to be made. The simplest changes are to have president/VP be voted in together, same for mayor/vice mayor, and to have regional senators instead of national so that each person only needs to choose one senator (this has the pleasant side effect of reducing the amount of money needed to win a senate seat). I have no solution for party-list, I'd rather have it be removed if no solution can be found\r\n\r\nAnd we need to start thinking about these things even outside of the electoral cycle (probably a bit hypocritical of me, I only post about election stuff during the election season). Going about ways to improve the next elections need to start as soon as the last elections end. Sometimes I feel like the Comelec has crammed a lot of stuff into the past year or so (registration, source code audits, rulings on party-lists, etc.) Why can't we ask candidates to register 3 years before the election? That way voters have a lot more time to become familiar with them and the candidates are forced to flesh out long-term plans instead of making excuses that they don't have time for debates.\r\n\r\nOkay, I complain a lot, but I'm still going to vote. I'm not one of those people who complains but won't vote. We should vote because (a) it's our responsibility and (b) it's an expression of what we as individuals desire to have in leaders of our country. And it's probably our responsibility to vote wisely too, though I'm not sure that's a rule encoded somewhere, the Comelec certainly doesn't emphasize it.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I'm still not sure of which senators I'll be voting for, most of my slots are up in the air (although there are many candidates I'm surely NOT voting for). I'll probably finalize my choices the weekend before the elections, and as has been my tradition, I will post my choices in this space. I'm registered in a different district than where I'm currently residing so I don't vote for congressman and councilors, so my only choices this time around are the 12 senators and mayor/vice mayor of QC.",

If you want to do your own research (I highly recommend it), here are some links to get you started:\r\n\r\n  span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"Movement for Good Governance briefers on Senatorial candidates/span\r\n  Rappler Senatorial profiles\r\n  I would also Google \"rappler [candidate name] interview\" for the interview article for each candidate (too many to list here)\r\n\r\nHere's a link to a Google doc of my own notes on each candidate, which I used as basis for recommendations below. (I didn't want to clutter up the blog post with details)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nRecommendations\r\n\r\nA number of people have asked me to recommend who they should vote; while I prefer that they do their own research I don't mind giving suggestions. Here are my recommendations:\r\n\r\n*Strongly recommended: *Jun Magsaysay, Risa Hontiveros, Teddy Casino\r\n\r\n*It's okay to vote for: *Legarda, Escudero, Pimentel, Madrigal, Zubiri, Hagedorn, Poe\r\n\r\n*It's okay to vote for the following if you don't mind them being members of or associated with political dynasties: *Cayetano, Gordon, Angara, Ejercito, Aquino\r\n\r\n*It's okay to vote for the following if you don't mind their strong association with religious groups: *Delos Reyes, Villanueva\r\n\r\n*Definitely DO NOT VOTE: *Honasan, Trillianes, Maceda, Mitos Magsaysay, Villar, Enrile, Binay, Cojuangco\r\n\r\nFor the \"it's okay to vote for\" groups, just use your own preferences, i.e. if you don't like Erap you probably won't vote for JV Ejercito.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nMy Ticket\r\n\r\nThe following will most likely be the 12 I will vote on Monday (barring something ridiculous happening):\r\n\r\n  span style=\"line-height: 13px;\"Jun Magsaysay (Team PNoy)/span\r\n  Risa Hontiveros (Team PNoy)\r\n  Teddy Casino (Independent)\r\n  Legarda (Team PNoy)\r\n  Escudero (Team PNoy)\r\n  Pimentel (Team PNoy)\r\n  Madrigal (Team PNoy)\r\n  Zubiri (UNA)\r\n  Hagedorn (Independent)\r\n 10. Gordon (UNA)\r\n 11. Angara (Team PNoy)\r\n 12. Aquino (Team PNoy)\r\n\r\nI understand that the choices aren't perfect (I'm not too fond of some of them... ), but we have a limited selection of viable candidates and I'd rather fill up all 12 slots to at least have an infinitesimally small chance that the candidates I don't want don't get in.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nWhat about the Party List?span style=\"line-height: 13px;\" There are really too many Party Lists to evaluate. Just don't vote for some ridiculous group; look for a group with a strong advocacy and track record. My personal preference is for strong#95 AGHAM Party List/strong, because SCIENCE! Here's a href=\"http://agham.org.ph/category/legislation/\"a list of legislation they've supported/a if you're interested./span\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nThat's the last post from me before the elections on Monday (I'll probably be ranting more on Twitter). If you have a chance to vote go out and do so, but be sure to do so wisely; it's your privilege and an expression of what you want for this country. Let's hope that the surveys are wrong and the voting public miraculously smartens up.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\nEdit: The original recommendations list missed out Grace Poe. Also added a short note on imperfect choices.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://mggphilippines.com/category/candidate-info/\r\n [2]: http://www.rappler.com/nation/politics/elections-2013/data/candidates/senator?limitstart=0\r\n [3]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Nlyo6P6MoOvdrrBCj533U-CZ3rzQWNaHtweq8_EyASU/edit\r\n [4]: https://twitter.com/roytang\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by edebelenmd on 2013-05-11 21:37:39 +0000\r\nThanks for the summary, Roy.

My eyes hurt a bit after a while of using the 3DS (even with 3D off). The Vita games also look a lot better compared to 3DS ones. The visuals are more crisp and colorful, especially for games like Persona 4 Golden or Disgaea 3.\r\n  I'm a Playstation Plus subscriber (and I have a PS3), which means my available Vita library gets bigger every month without me spending additional money. And with the PS4 support coming, it's even better.\r\n  No online account for the 3DS means I'm not going to make digital purchases off the eShop, which limits my available library. I'm not interested in making eShop purchases that are tied to the machine; I'm worried about losing or breaking the system and losing access to all my purchases. This is a severe limitation of the 3DS in this age of digital downloads.\r\n  I just find that I like more games on the Vita. I like Mario and Zelda on the 3DS (I've finished NSMB, Mario 3D Land and Ocarina of Time; the new Legend of Zelda will probably be the next game I play on 3DS), but aside from that most of the library is meh for me. I played Tales of the Abyss and Paper Mario Sticker Star on the 3ds but both got boring for me after a while (I'm probably at around 80% of ToA and gave up on Sticker Star at the first boss). I might try out Fire Emblem, and if there's a new Advance Wars I'd jump on that. Etrian Odyssey looks interesting but there are dungeon crawlers on the Vita too. On the Vita so far I've been playing P4G, Disgaea 3 and Gravity Rush, with some Street Fighter x Tekken thrown in every so often. As soon as I get a bigger memory card, I'm going to get into Blazblue Continuum Shift;  then there's Uncharted and Final Fantasy Tactics and I heard Zero Escape was good, and I want to try Guacamelee, and one of these days I'm going to give in to impulse buying urges and get Xenogears off the store, oh and if LBP Vita went on sale I'd get that, etc. People who say the Vita doesn't have games might just be uninformed; in terms of the number of games I'm interested the Vita is slightly ahead, and that whole PS1 classic back library puts it leagues ahead.\r\n  Achievements/Trophies. I realize a lot of people don't care for them and don't \"get\" people who like them and that's fine, more power to you. But I do like them, though I'm not like a platinum hunter or anything like that.\r\n\r\nThe only real downside of the Vita as far as I can tell is that the memory cards are helluva expensive; but maybe that will change this week.\r\n\r\nAnd... that's it. Just thought I'd write some gaming stuff since E3 is happening in a few hours. 😀",

I wouldn't claim to be a fan either, though I follow the history because of being generally a comic book guy (I got less than 50% of the answers in a recent Superman round in one of the local quiz nights =/) That being said, I did re-watch the first 2 Donner Superman movies and re-read All-Star Superman and Superman: For Tomorrow ahead of watching the movie. So, I look at the movie from the point of view of someone familiar with the lore, but not all the history of the character.\r\n\r\nFirst the hype: before the release, there were people claiming that Man of Steel was the best superhero movie, with one reviewer even claiming it to be better than The Dark Knight. Now that I've seen it, I'm going to have to disagree; The Dark Knight _was a clever movie with a terrific villain built upon a solid universe established by _Batman Begins; Man of Steel is by no means a bad movie, but it's pretty much just a straightforward action flick.\r\n\r\nSecond, the action scenes: probably the most entertaining part of the movie for me would be the fight scenes between Kal and the other Kryptonians. It probably helped that I had just watched _Superman 2 _the week before which featured laughable (by modern standards) fight scenes between Superman and Zod and his two henchmen. Compared to the older movie, the battles here are much more grand in scale and effect, with the final showdown between Kal and Zod taking down a whole lot of buildings in Metropolis (more on that later), giving the battle a Dragonball-like feel (I like Dragonball, so that's fine). The opening sequence on Krypton was okay too, with kind of a Star Wars vibe going for it. (I noted that first Superman movie took 20 minutes before Kal was shot off Krypton, I think Man of Steel takes even longer.)\r\n\r\nNow, the story. Like I said, very straightforward. Bad guy comes threatening people, Superman punches them around until we figure out a magical way to get rid of them. Then some more punching. Okay. Specific points:\r\n\r\nChanges to Krypton's back story and Superman's origin? Ok, I'm fine with that, although it's never really explained why the Kryptonians abandoned space travel or why the colonies couldn't survive alone. I'm not even sure they have a canon explanation in the comics as to why there weren't a bunch of other Kryptonians who jumped into rockets to escape. No Kryptonite? Okay, that's fine -- the simulated Kryptonian atmosphere probably has trace elements from Krypton that could be hand-waved into some sort of Kryptonite later if needed.\r\n\r\nPa Kent dying to a tornado and Clark doing nothing to save him? Ugh, I remember whispering \"that's terrible\" to my brother who was watching with me. In most continuities where Pa Kent dies, it's almost always due to a heart attack -- where the idea is that Clark learns how his powers won't let him save everyone no matter how hard he tries. In this movie, Pa Kent's death was entirely preventable even if you assume that his protectiveness of Clark's powers was so strong as to override his own survival instinct and Clark's instinct not to save his adoptive father. It's not like the townsfolk didn't know about Clark's powers either, at least two kids and one parent knew, and that pretty much meant he grew up with rumors of his powers all around town. And the most ridiculous part is that he died trying to rescue a dog. A dog. A dog! Order of priorities: Save dog  Don't let Clark use powers  Stay alive.\r\n\r\nApparently it only takes Clark two tries to learn how to fly. And he instinctively knows how to fight while flying too! In Donner's Superman, Clark took a long hiatus from the world to learn the history of Krypton and how to use his powers, here it only took him overnight on an ancient Kryptonian scouting ship. Okay, this isn't really a problem, for all we know there was some magic Kryptonian mind meld device in the ship to explain this away.\r\n\r\nOkay, here's the big one: heroism and killing Zod, this is where we see a major departure from the Superman mythos. Before the Kryptonian invasion, we see Kal doing heroic things exactly twice: on the ocean platform at the start of the movie and saving his classmates in the school bus. And in the school bus incident he says to Pa Kent \"what was I supposed to do, let them die?\" and Pa Kent answers, \"maybe\". That conversation was in one of the trailers too and at the time I knew it was off. One of the big things about the Superman mythos is that he grows up to become a hero because of how the Kents raised him, that they instilled in him a way of thinking that prioritized doing the right thing regardless of the sacrifices you had to make. The idea being that being raised by the Kents contributes to his being Superman as much as his alien heritage does. Comparing Superman to Batman, the comparison is often made that for Batman, Bruce Wayne is his disguise and Batman is who he really sees himself to be, while for Clark it's the opposite: Superman is his disguise and Clark Kent, the person raised by the Kents, is who he really is. Man of Steel has none of that, Man of Steel is all about the alien heritage. Not to say that he's selfish or not heroic, after all he does decide to turn himself in during the Invasion, but I feel like the comic-book Superman wouldn't have needed to talk to a priest first. (I feel like that scene randomly wanted to reference For Tomorrow)\r\n\r\nIn the final scene when Kal is forced to kill Zod to save civilians, why does he have such anguish afterwards? The movie had made no earlier indication that this Superman had a distaste for killing; heck millions of lives were probably lost due to Kal and Zod tearing each other apart across Metropolis (I feel like comic-book Superman would have at least tried to bring the battle to a less-populated area). Because I'm a comic-book fan I know that he made that scream of anguish because he didn't want to have to kill since that's a standard part of the Superman mythos (heavily emphasized in the What's So Funny About Truth, Justice & the American Way? _story arc and later in _Superman vs the Elite), but for the normal moviegoers I feel like they might have gone \"huh\"?\r\n\r\nThere's almost no characterization for the side characters here -- Lana is barely relevant (though of course she had to appear for lore reasons), and they could have dropped Steve Lombard without consequence and that whole scene with the Daily Planet girl stuck under rubble wasn't even needed. I'm really annoyed about Perry White not wanting to run the alien story because people might not take it well. He's a journalist -- his first concern should be the truth! I'm not sure why they needed Emil Hamilton here either. Bah, they'll probably get more play time in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThose are the major nitpicks I have with the movie, the rest are just minor details (although there are a lot of them.) Many of the problems are due to expectations of Superman based on what I know from the comics. I guess we can forgive some of them, since movie Superman doesn't need to be the same as comic book Superman, in the same way that Nolan's Batman wasn't exactly comic book Batman either.\r\n\r\nAll of that being said, I still enjoyed the movie, it was entertaining enough for a first movie in the franchise (and it's way better than Superman Returns). I'd rank it close to or below Amazing Spider-Man I think. A sequel is already being planned and hopefully we get a better, more clever movie the second time around. If it were up to me, the second movie villian(s) would be Luthor and Metallo (With Nolan and Snyder, I think we can look forward to a more interesting take on Lex Luthor compared to Hackman's self-declared \"greatest criminal mind in history\" at least.), with a third movie either for Braniac or Doomsday (Braniac would probably be better). It probably depends on their plans for a shared universe and a Justice League movie though. Let's see how it all pans out; in any case, it's a good time to be a comic book fan!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

(I guess comics count as reading too, but I'm talking about full-length novels.\r\n\r\nFor 2013 as far as I can tell I only finished reading the following novels:\r\n\r\n  Slaughterhouse Five (Kurt Vonnegut)\r\n  Foundation Trilogy (Isaac Asimov) -- I only read up to Second Foundation, I'll get around to the later books sometime I guess\r\n  A Memory of Light (Sanderson/Jordan) -- been reading the Wheel of Time for years and I'm glad Sanderson was able to bring it to a decent end\r\n  Shadows in Flight (Orson Scott Card)\r\n\r\nI suppose I should make it a new years resolution to read more books. I have a reading list that I have stored on Dropbox that I'm trying to work through. I think getting more paper books helps -- most of my reading the past few years has been mostly e-books but having at least one paper book around that I can pick up without worrying about a charger or something is also good. I'm around halfway through a copy of Dune I picked up at a used bookstore.\r\n\r\nAs for games, this is the hobby that takes up most of my free time, however my backlog is horrendously large. Inspired by a NeoGAF thread, I've started tracking purchases and finishes/completes.\r\n\r\nHere are the game purchases I made in 2013:\r\n\r\n  Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm (PC retail)\r\n  span style=\"line-height: 1.5em;\"FTL (humble bundle)/span\r\n  Humble Weekly Sale: Telltale Games (8 games)\r\n  Humble Bundle 8 (9 games)\r\n  WB Humble Bundle (9 games)\r\n  Borderlands 2 + season pass + mech/psycho dlc (GMG + Steam)\r\n  Civilization 5: Brave New World (GMG)\r\n  Morrowind GOTY (Steam)\r\n  Oblivion GOTY (Steam)\r\n  Legend of Grimrock (steam)\r\n  Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014 (steam)\r\n  Tales of Graces F (PS3 retail)\r\n  Injustice (PS3 retail)\r\n  The Last of Us (PS3 retail)\r\n  Kingdom Hearts 1.5 HD Remix (PS3 retail)\r\n  Final Fantasy 13-2 (PS3 retail)\r\n  Tales of Xillia (PS3 retail)\r\n  Capcom vs SNK 2 (PS3 via PSN)\r\n  Ni no Kuni (PS3 via PSN)\r\n  Speklunky (Vita via PSN)\r\n  Guacamelee (PS3/Vita via PSN)\r\n  Marvel vs Capcom 2 (PS3 via PSN)\r\n  Shin Megami Tensei 4 (3ds retail)\r\n  The Legend of Zelda: A Link between Worlds (3ds retail)\r\n  Persona 4 Golden (Vita retail)\r\n  Disgaea 3 (Vita retail)\r\n  Street Fighter x Tekken (Vita retail)\r\n  FF9 (PSN)\r\n  Persona 3 Portable (PSN)\r\n\r\nAnd the games I finished in 2013:\r\n\r\n  Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm campaign\r\n  Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014\r\n  Borderlands 2\r\n  Injustice story mode\r\n  Mass Effect 3\r\n  The Last of Us\r\n  Tales of Graces F\r\n  Tales of Xillia (Milla side only)\r\n  The Legend of Zelda: A Link between Worlds\r\n  Persona 4 Golden\r\n  Disgaea 3 main story\r\n  Civ5 BNW (I'm going to go ahead and count this since I'm sure I got more than a full game's worth of it already)\r\n\r\nSo the count is at -41 or such. It's pretty bad, but also around what I expected lol. I'm fairly close to finishing a number of those games (I'm at the SMT4 final dungeon and the last chapter of FF 13-2 right now). A lot of the backlog is due to me randomly picking up Humble Bundles which increase the count significantly. Hopefully I'll be able to have a much smaller backlog in 2014 -- but there are already a number of release I'm looking forward to, not to mention the possibility of picking up a PS4 early next year.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/8859374/reading_list.txt\r",

Spoilers abound!\r\n\r\nAction-packed! The web-swinging is fun and looks and feels just like Spidey from the comic books. Spider-man moves and fights and banters pretty faithfully to the comic book version of our favorite wall-crawler, so that's a definite plus. Peter's Spider-sense is portrayed as a slow-motion bullet-time kind of deal which allows him to react quickly and save all the people while dodging everything. It doesn't really translate exactly to the comic-book Spider-sense, but I suppose it's better than having squiggly lines around his head.\r\n\r\n*Peter Parker, haunted by... the ghost of Dennis Leary? *We get it, you're breaking the promise you made at the end of the first movie and you're putting Gwen in danger. What, did he become the physical embodiment of the Spider-sense? If I was Captain Stacy I'd haunt you too for stalking my daughter from the rooftops! Not even Uncle Ben haunted Peter like this!\r\n\r\nAnd the deep dark secret of Peter's parents is... what, is that it? Seriously, that was a lame reveal after all the drama at the start of the movie; it didn't seem entirely too relevant and more like a subplot that didn't go anywhere. The mysterious party who would've benefited from Oscorp experiments and was willing to hire an assassin to kill the parents on a plane was never elaborated on. Maybe it's something they'll explore in a future film, but for now it feels like they were just forced to create a link because of the mysterious disappearance of the parents from the first movie.\r\n\r\nNorman Osborn, Spider-man's greatest enemy! No? Decrepit old man on his deathbed? Dying of some weird goblinitis disease? Okay, at least Harry's here, right?\r\n\r\nHarry Osborn, Spider-man's best friend turned worst enemy! Or at least we're told they're good friends, we just have to take their word for it. There they are joking like old pals for two minutes, surely we must be convinced they are best buds! BTW Pete, old-friend-of-mine-who-I-havent-had-contact-with-for-10-years-even-though-social-media-should-already-exist-at-this-time, can you get me some Spider-man blood? I'm dying brah\r\n\r\nMax Dillon! Electro! Mild-mannered electrical engineer with low self-esteem who ignores safety procedures and gets bitten by radioactive electric eels! Seriously? I'm looking forward to the Sinister Six movie where Adrian Toomes gets bitten by a radioactive vulture. We get a high-power-level version of Electro here, he's able to teleport around as electrical charges or something and he's even able to magically generate underwear and later a bodysuit! But he's no match for Peter Parker's questionable movie science!\r\n\r\n*Not enough villains? Let's add the Rhino! *Well, just for a quick scene at the end to lead into the Sinister Six movie, maybe? A scene that we've already seen in the trailers too! I suppose it's a blessing that they didn't try to shoehorn a Rhino subplot, there's already too much going on as it is.\r\n\r\n*Oh no, two airplanes might collide because there's no electricity! *How was this even relevant to Spider-man's battle? It's not like he knew what was going on at the airport!\r\n\r\n\"You need me, I know the specs to the grid thingy!\" Uh, it turns out all you needed to do was know how to pick up a key from a dead guy's hand and unlock a panel. And I thought her field was in biochemistry or something, not electrical engineering?\r\n\r\n*I have to admit, the death at the end caught me off guard. *I knew it had to happen sooner or later, but given that they cut MJ out of this movie and had a subplot of Gwen flying off to England (which she did in the comics and she managed to come back to New York before the big deal at the bridge), I assumed it would be happening in the next film. Though by the time they had her falling from the tower, I would've been annoyed if they didn't go through with it after the build-up. But now I'm worried that they're going to rush the Peter-MJ relationship in the next movie the same way they rushed the Peter-Harry friendship in this one, since they didn't get the chance to introduce MJ while Peter and Gwen were still a thing.\r\n\r\nWhere's the scene where the New Yorkers come together to help Spider-Man? Isn't this a franchise staple by now?\r\n\r\n*End credits sequence teases the Sinister Six lineup. *Well, that was fine.\r\n\r\n*Overall *plotting and pacing felt weird, with some scene transitions feeling like they could be better handled. The whole thing at the end with how Peter deals with Gwen's fate felt weirdly out of place. They could've ended the second movie on a down note, and have Peter coming back strong in TASM3 (an Empire Strikes Back sort of thing), but no, they wanted to get the grieving out of the way quickly. Well, the movie was fun and enjoyable to watch, and had quite a few recognizable names for comic books fans (I'm sure all the comic readers noted the name of Harry's assistant and Max's boss), but all the nitpicky problems above pull the movie down especially when we just came back from the awesomeness that was Captain America: Winter Soldier.\r\n\r\nNext: Days of Future Past!",

        "content": "---\r\nauthor: roy\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2014-11-09 00:22:11\r\ntitle: Text spam, mobile number privacy and arguing over the internet\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2014/11/text-spam-mobile-number-privacy-and-arguing-over-the-internet/\r\n---\r\n\r\nGlobe's Spam Reports Policy\r\n\r\nA few days ago I got dragged into a debate over Twitter regarding Globe's policy on handling reports sent in via Twitter about spam/scam text messages. When you send in reports of text spams via Twitter, one of Globe's representatives will ask you to agree that in case the spammer disputes the allegation, they would have to disclose your mobile number to them. For me, the policy seems completely reasonable: if you accuse someone of a crime, they should have a right to know what exactly they are accused of and who exactly the victim was. Apparently some people aren't okay with this; they complain that Globe disclosing your mobile number would be an additional violation of privacy and opens you up to possible harassment by the spammer. Now, I can understand the concerns, but you have to look at things from the POV of Globe and consider why such a policy exists.\r\n\r\nAllowing people to anonymously accuse someone of being a spammer could lead to abuse. What if you had a vengeful ex who sent in one of your texts or someone faked a screenshot to accuse you of being a spammer? I'm not sure what other ways there are to abuse this, but I know that not disclosing your number is like reporting a rape attempt and then refusing to identify yourself. How can the accused defend himself? Sure there is some possibility of harassment, but that's true whenever anyone comes forward to report a crime. And note that Globe will only reveal your number if the spammer comes forward to dispute, which exposes the spammer himself. I've been reporting on average maybe 3-5 spam texts to Globe per week for the past few months (although I have serious doubts on the effectiveness of this -- more on that later) and no one has ever come forward to dispute. And I don't believe any real spammers ever will; the whole reason they use disposable mobile numbers in the first place is to so that they're hard to catch. Coming forward to dispute charges only exposes them.\r\n\r\nArguing over the Internet\r\n\r\nAs an aside, Twitter is literally the worst sort of format for this sort of discourse. I got dragged into the discussion by a friend who knew I often reported to Globe, and for a while I was responding via my mobile and working with less than 80 characters per post since there were a number of people (that I didn't know) involved. Sure enough I got a barrage of replies from some people, one of whom apparently wasn't even aware that even screenshots can be edited (welcome to the internet!). I really shouldn't have let myself get dragged into it, but now that I was there, as XKCD so famously put it:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/duty_calls.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"330\" /\r\n\r\nThe problem with debating on the internet in general of course (aside from all the trolls) is that a lot of people easily get aggravated and just lash out without even considering other POVs or the reason why certain policies are in place, which makes their arguments not very constructive at all. Instead of trying to understand the situation so that they could suggest possible workarounds or solutions, they just act indignant and insist on their view. Eventually, I finally quit replying via mobile and just waited til I got home so that I could post a longer response via twitlonger. I gave my opinions (stated above) and just said thanks for the lively debate and let myself out of the discussion.\r\n\r\nOn the effectiveness of reporting spam\r\n\r\nAs I said, I don't actually think reporting spam texts to Globe is very effective; these spammers use disposable mobile numbers that they discard as soon as possible and there are literally billions of possible numbers, so disabling their numbers one at a time wouldn't be very useful. Spam is an age-old problem (in internet years at least) that hasn't even been solved in the email world, even by big companies like Google. A more reasonable answer would be spam filtering, the same type Google uses for gmail (not Yahoo mail's filtering, that seems to be much less effective). However, this filtering can't be done on Globe's side, since that introduces the possibility of false positives. It has to be done on the client-side, that means on your mobile phone itself. A quick search tells me there are some android apps that claim to provide sms spam filtering, but I've never tried any of them so I cannot speak for their effectiveness. And where does that leave people without smartphones?\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that the default SMS applications for smartphones aren't as sophisticated as email clients are: no support for folders or automated filters, etc. that would make inbox management a lot easier. On the email side, spam hasn't really been solved yet but has been brought to manageable levels by filtering. On the SMS side, we'll have to wait for phone software to catch up.\r\n\r\nOn mobile numbers and privacy\r\n\r\nA better question would be, how do these spammers get our numbers in the first place? There are many different types of spam, and I'm sure many of them just take advantage of unlimited text promos to spam numbers randomly by brute force. One type of text spam that's fairly common (at least for me) is offers of some sort of loans from different banks. Aside from text spam, it's actually happened that I received a call from someone offering cash loans from a certain bank. When I asked him how they got my number he just said it was \"in their database\" and wouldn't tell me how it got there. I told him off angrily and hung up (I regret that now, I really should have tried to get more details like who his manager was and what branch he was working at so that I could complain to the bank later). What this incident tells me is that the sort of people who blindly push cash loans to people have a database of numbers they use. Some of the calls/spam text I got were from banks that I've never transacted with, so I suspect that these numbers are leaked/stolen by unscrupulous bank employees, since most bank account forms ask for your mobile number.  Or maybe these loan spamming operations are sanctioned by the banks themselves? It's not out of the realm of possibility. If these banks had modern feedback channels like via Twitter or Facebook I'd definitely be asking them about it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion?\r\n\r\nIf I don't think Globe's spam reporting policy isn't effective, why do I still report spam on a regular basis? I don't know, maybe it's just a small token of fighting back against spammers, of fighting a war that can't be won. Maybe every report I make reduces their address space by a teensy-tiny bit and there's always hope we'll get there someday. Maybe it's just cathartic for me, I don't know. I'll keep doing it for the foreseeable future, and I'll be suggesting any possible improvements to the policies where I can. I don't want to be one of those people who rant on the internet without doing something constructive.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

I've been meaning to post about it, but it got lost in my backlog. So here we are.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-963\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Day-2-Opening0.jpg\" alt=\"Day-2-Opening0\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1120\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Day-2-Opening0.jpg 1920w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Day-2-Opening0-300x175.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Day-2-Opening_0-1024x597.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\r\n\r\nYes indeed, I still play Magic, \"on and off\", as it happens with most Magic players with busy lives and/or multiple other hobbies. I wouldn't miss a chance to play a local Grand Prix of course, so I started getting back into standard as soon as Khans of Tarkir rotated in. I couldn't stand the grindy midrange Abzan mirrors, so I've been playing Jeskai pretty much since the format started; Mantis Riders at first, then transitioned to tokens in December after I did poorly at a couple of GPTs.\r\n\r\nThe list I ran, largely based off Yuuya Watanabe's Player's Championship deck (sideboard might not be accurate... I may have taken too long to write this up :p):\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist title=\"Jeskai Tokens\" }}\r\n  \r\n[Creatures]\r\n  \r\n4 Seeker of the Way\r\n  \r\n4 Goblin Rabblemaster\r\n  \r\n[/Creatures]\r\n  \r\n[Spells]\r\n  \r\n4 Raise the Alarm\r\n  \r\n4 Hordeling Outburst\r\n  \r\n4 Lightning Strike\r\n  \r\n4 Stoke the Flames\r\n  \r\n4 Treasure Cruise\r\n  \r\n4 Jeskai Ascendancy\r\n  \r\n2 Jeskai Charm\r\n  \r\n2 Chandra, Pyromancer\r\n  \r\n[/Spells]\r\n  \r\n[Lands]\r\n  \r\n4 Mystic Monastery\r\n  \r\n4 Temple of Triumph\r\n  \r\n2 Temple of Epiphany\r\n  \r\n3 Shivan Reef\r\n  \r\n3 Battlefield Forge\r\n  \r\n3 Flooded Strand\r\n  \r\n2 Mountain\r\n  \r\n1 Island\r\n  \r\n2 Plains\r\n  \r\n[/Lands]\r\n  \r\n[Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n2 Glare of Heresy\r\n  \r\n2 Suspension Field\r\n  \r\n3 Disdainful Stroke\r\n  \r\n1 Negate\r\n  \r\n2 Erase\r\n  \r\n1 Elspeth, Sun's Champion\r\n  \r\n2 Hushwing Gryff\r\n  \r\n2 Magma Spray\r\n  \r\n[/Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\nThis was probably the GP where I was most prepared in terms of deckbuilding -- I didn't scrimp on card availability this time although my team pool hasn't been as large as it used to be. Playtesting wasn't much, mostly against Abzan variants and the aforementioned GPTs where I crashed and burned.\r\n\r\nI did pretty well on day one:\r\n\r\nR01 2-0 WIN vs ub control\r\nR02 2-0 WIN vs ub control\r\nR03 2-0 WIN vs temur\r\nR04 2-0 WIN vs temur\r\nR05 2-0 WIN vs temur\r\nR06 0-2 LOSS vs abzan whip\r\nR07 2-0 WIN vs monored\r\nR08 2-1 WIN vs jeskai tokens\r\nR09 2-0 WIN vs abzan midrange (terry soh)\r\n\r\nThat's 8 and 1, my best Day One performance ever. My deck was running well, I was in the zone, I had some good matchups and luck was in favor a lot; I won at least 3 games against different opponents due to their mulligans to 5 or worse. I performed well enough to warrant a mention in the coverage even:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately Day Two didn't go quite as well; apparently the luck I had during Day One had to be paid back with interest. I lost at least three games off mulligans to five, and my lack of playtesting against some archetypes such as UW Heroic cost me some suboptimal plays.\r\n\r\nR10 0-2 LOSS vs uw heroic\r\nR11 2-1 WIN vs abzan aggro\r\nR12 2-0 WIN vs jeskai tempo\r\nR13 0-2 LOSS vs mardu\r\nR14 0-2 LOSS vs monored\r\nR15 2-1 WIN vs abzan aggro\r\n\r\nGoing 3-3 on Day Two means I finished the GP at 11-4, which was the same record I had a href=\"http://roytang.net/2012/06/grand-prix-manila-2012/\"back in 2012/a. That's good enough this year for a 37th place finish and some cash:\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nNot a bad performance at all, and it was a great weekend altogether: got to see some old friends again and it feels to do well at a high-level event. What next; should I go to GP Singapore this year too?\r\n\r",

It was my first trip outside of Southeast Asia and the first time I took a long haul flight. Other than my concerns regarding the possibility of my luggage getting lost, the trip was relatively smooth and the Singapore Airlines plane had relatively decent food, service and in-flight entertainment.\r\n\r\nThe first leg of our trip was to Barcelona, Spain (aside from the layover in Singapore). My first impression of Barcelona (and hence my first impression of Europe) was that it was a very...  brown city. Most of the buildings were shades of red or brown. Barcelona felt quiet, maybe even rustic. There were a lot of wide-open spaces making it very friendly for walking, with most of the city center structured in well-organised square blocks that made it easy to navigate. The first few days of the trip were very relaxed, we walked around a lot looking at ornately-decorated buildings and hitting the occasional tourist spot like Sagrada Familia and Park Guell. We even managed to do poorly at a pub quiz somewhere in between.\r\n\r\nThe second leg of the trip took us to Rome, Italy. As opposed to Barcelona, Rome felt busy, crowded and very much a tourist city, easily evidenced by the numerous souvenir stands and sellers of selfie sticks that littered the seemingly unpredictable maze of cobblestone streets interspersed with ruins and fountains and plazas and museums and churches and ornate sculptures and Egyptian obelisks. The city is pretty much an open museum -- there's always something to see around the nearest corner. Unfortunately, the famous Trevi Fountain was undergoing renovation during our visit, but we also managed to visit the Colloseum and the Palatino / Roman Forum (that place is huge).\r\n\r\nWe allocated one day of the stay in Rome to visit Vatican City. For the first and last time we hired a tour guide (and maybe overpaid) to take us through the Vatican Museum and so we could use the secret tour guide entrance to St. Peter's Basilica. There was a lot of stuff in the museum, but the Sistine Chapel ceiling and the Basilica itself were the highlights of tour. Or maybe that's just because I'm a Catholic.\r\n\r\nThe next leg took us to Paris, France. Paris was cold, very cold, with biting winds. Easily the coldest city I've been to. It felt more like a city than either Rome or Barcelona did, with long avenues and high-end shops. Not particularly tourist-friendly, given that there's less English speakers around. Also the most expensive among the cities we've visited -- with food costing maybe 1.5 or 2 times as much as it did in the prior two cities. The Louvre and the Eiffel Tower (especially the view from the top) were magnificent though, well worth the cost of entry.\r\n\r\nAfter Paris we spent the last few days of the trip back in Barcelona, relaxing and decompressing. We walked around a bit, visited the beach and I even managed to hit a Magic prerelease the day before our flight home. I managed to get back into work immediately after almost an entire day of travelling, with minimal jet lag even.\r\n\r\nThere's more to talk about that I won't write about at the moment -- the on-the-fly planning, the food, the hostels, the budget airline flights, etc. I signed up for the trip on a bit of a whim, but it turned out to be a pretty good trip for me. I've never been a culturally inclined guy, but I still found myself immersed in all the ancient sites and museums we visited. The company was good, it was nice to experience an entirely new continent, and it was a welcome break from the usual routine.",

So here we are.\r\n\r\nSaturday March 7th\r\n\r\nMy first impression of Barcelona (and hence my first impression of Europe) was that it was a very… brown city. Most of the buildings were shades of red or brown.\r\n\r\nThe three of us arrived at the Barcelona airport around ten in the morning and from there took a metro train to the Barcelona Sants station. One of the first things I noticed (aside from the brownness of the buildings as the train rode into the city proper) was the vast amount of colorfully-lettered graffiti that can be seen on many walls as the train passed by. This sort of graffiti would turn out to be common not only here but in Paris and Rome as well (though not as much)\r\n\r\nFrom the station our hostel would be a short walk, but first we hunted around the Sants station for a place to eat. We looked at some signs for the McDonald's inside the station before deciding we wouldn't be having any American fast food for the duration of our trip. We ate at the adjacent restaurant instead, taking in an assortment of breakfast foods on some sort of combo plates. We didn't have too much language trouble even though the staff spoke no English. Although the local language is Catalan, most of the locals will speak or understand Spanish, and we spoke and understood a bit of Spanish ourselves.\r\n\r\nWe stepped out of the station to a crisp windy afternoon, with the temperature a bit under 10 degrees. I was worried that my hoodie might not be able to handle the expected cold Europe weather but I held up fine so far. We walked around a bit a midst crowds of skateboarding, rollerblading and scooter-riding youths before figuring out where we were supposed to go for the fifteen minute walk to our hostel. We walked through what a quaint area with a wide open space in the middle of the road for pedestrians -- such a thing seemed impossible back in crowded Metro Manila. Many of the storefronts were closed, probably for the weekend, with their metal security grills lined with the same style of colorfully-lettered graffiti I saw from the train.\r\n\r\nFor this leg we would be staying at Free Hostels Barcelona. The lady at the reception was very friendly and her English was quite good. She answered most of our questions and handed us a few tourist friendly maps that highlighted many of the places we could visit in the city before showing us our rooms. It was a dormitory-type room with four beds and storage units, a bathroom and not much else. One of the beds was already occupied, she said, so the three of us would be sharing a room with a stranger that night. (Spoiler: we did not get murdered in our sleep)\r\n\r\nAfter resting up for a bit, we went out to spend the afternoon taking in a bit more of the city. We made our way towards the nearby Plaza España; the friendly hostel reception lady told us the mall there would give us a good view of the city from the top floor. On the way we passed by what one of my companions called out as a \"giant penis\":figure id=\"attachment_991\" style=\"width: 539px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"wp-image-991 size-full\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/day1penis.jpg\" alt=\"Photo credit: Ryan Liwanag\" width=\"539\" height=\"551\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/day1penis.jpg 539w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/day1_penis-293x300.jpg 293w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 539px) 100vw, 539px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"&#8216;Dona i Ocell' Sculpture at Parc Joan de Miro -- Photo credit: Ryan Liwanag/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nWe climbed to the top of the Centro Comercial de las Arenas, which I found comparable to a small mall back home with mostly high-end shops. The circular rooftop was an open-air area that gave a good view of the nearby city and some fancy restaurants that we thought of eating at but never managed to get back to.figure id=\"attachment_994\" style=\"width: 2048px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-994\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/centrodelasarenas.jpg\" alt=\"The view from atop the Centro Comercial de las Arenas - Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/centrodelasarenas.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/centrodelasarenas-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/centrodelasarenas-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/centrodelas_arenas-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"The view from atop the Centro Comercial de las Arenas -- Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nWe decided to head towards that large building in the distance (I believe it was some sort of museum) since friendly hostel lady told us there was a nice fountain show there we could see. On the way we got distracted by this street performer doing bubbles.figure id=\"attachment_996\" style=\"width: 2048px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-996\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bubbleguy.jpg\" alt=\"Bubble Guy - Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bubbleguy.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bubbleguy-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bubbleguy-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bubbleguy-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Bubble Guy -- Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nSince we were a bit too early for the fountain show, we sat there for a while to take a break from all the walking and let ourselves be entertained by the large bubbles and the little kids enjoying them. He was using two short sticks with some rope entwined to catch some of his soap solution and he would let the brisk wind create the large bubbles. \"I should try this back home, the niece would enjoy it.\" (Spoiler: I haven't tried it)\r\n\r\nShortly before 7 pm we went to the fountain area where there was already a large number of people gathered around the nearby steps and other seating areas in anticipation of the show. There were street performers entertaining some sections of the crowd with some sort of dance-off, but the fountain show began before they could come over to our side.figure id=\"attachment_998\" style=\"width: 2048px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-998\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fountain.jpg\" alt=\"Fountain Show - Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fountain.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fountain-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fountain-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fountain-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Fountain Show -- Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nThe fountain show was some sort of preprogrammed series of lights and changes in the fountain heights and angles against a backdrop of someone who sounds like Freddie Mercury singing something that starts with \"Barcelonaaaaaaa~\" The show was very good, I don't believe I've seen anything like it locally (but then again I don't see fountain shows too often). Imagine, I said to myself, somewhere out there are people who design these shows for a living.\r\n\r\nWe enjoyed the show a bit longer before deciding to head back to the hostel to get an early rest after the long travels.\r\n\r\nSunday March 8th\r\n\r\nI woke up earlier than my travelling companions and headed out to the hostel's common area to check out the free breakfast. Breakfast was cold cuts of ham and sausage, slices of cheese, bread and croissants with various spreads and some juice. Nothing too fancy (i.e. no bacon), but there was lots of food for us to enjoy. The spread would be the same every morning, and it meant we could load up on breakfast so that we don't have to spend too much on lunch and dinner.\r\n\r\nIt was Sunday and as a Catholic I was planning to hear English mass. As far as I could tell from the internet, the only place to do that was the Parish of Mary the Queen at 10am. One of my companions wanted to hear mass in Spanish and the other one was planning to attend a football match around noon, so we separated for the first half of the day.\r\n\r\nThe church I wanted to go to was around 3.5 kilometers away, a 40 minute walk according to Google Maps. I allocated an hour and a half to walk there at a more leisurely pace. It turned out to be a good call, as Google Maps didn't tell me I'd be walking up a bunch of inclined roads (these wouldn't be the only inclines I'd have trouble with in Barcelona... ). I passed by mostly residential areas, with small parks every few blocks letting me take a few minutes break when I needed it.figure id=\"attachment_1002\" style=\"width: 1459px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1002\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/church.jpg\" alt=\"Maria Reina Church in Barcelona\" width=\"1459\" height=\"821\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/church.jpg 1459w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/church-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/church-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/church-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1459px) 100vw, 1459px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Maria Reina Church in Barcelona/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nI was greeted at the church entrance by some white folks who were waiting for the mass to start. The church itself wasn't too large, it was maybe a third the size of where I usually hear mass back home. There weren't too many attendees, maybe around 50 people at best, which is less than I would have thought given the large Catholic population in Spain, though I guess most of them hear mass in the local languages. Most of the attendees seemed to be locals instead of expats; for some reason I was expecting a larger Asian/Filipino presence, maybe based on when I heard mass in Hong Kong or Singapore. The priest was very friendly and would greet each mass-goer as they left after the service. He even gave me a \"good job!\" with thumbs up as I went out, not sure why 😀\r\n\r\nFriends know I enjoy a good quiz night, and my travelling companions were no different. So for Sunday night, we planned to attend an English pub quiz at the Black Horse Pub, roughly an hour's walk from our hostel. We met up again late into the afternoon and headed out on foot (we liked walking, apparently). Along the way we enjoyed the fancy-looking buildings that lined the major roads. There are apparently no skyscrapers in Barcelona, most of the buildings we saw were maybe five or six stories high at most, with most of them being old-timey buildings lined with fancy ornate facades and some with random minarets or towers at the top. Any time we passed by an obviously modern-style building it looked hilariously out of place.\r\n\r\nWe decided to walk along the Via Laietana, a thoroughfare famous for buildings with different kinds of fancy architecture (I am too ignorant to name them). Aside from the buildings and their architecture which I am surely unqualified to describe, the street itself had a wide middle island for pedestrians, the island lined with trees that looked like they were groomed to look similar in branch structure, recovering from winter. The middle island held a number of outdoor seating areas for the nearby restaurants, a common thing in Barcelona. We debated having some paella right there, since that's the famous dish in the region, but the menus here were a bit pricy so I suggested in Tagalog that we look for some cheaper alternatives later near our hostel. As chance would have it, one of the restaurant staff we passed by overheard us and I heard him say behind us we walked away \"Mura dito!\", leading me to comment about the innate ability of Pinoys to find one another when in a foreign land.\r\n\r\nIt was night time by the time we found the pub among a maze of side streets, and the friendly British proprietor welcomed us for their quiz night. The questions were recited out loud in both Spanish and English (leading to one of my companions translating the Spanish instead of paying attention to the English one!). We took an early lead since we used our joker early, but fell behind when it came to the music-related categories (not an uncommon result for our quiz nights!)figure id=\"attachment_1004\" style=\"width: 3264px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1004\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/quiz-night.jpg\" alt=\"Our quiz night results - who  knows what place we finished\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/quiz-night.jpg 3264w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/quiz-night-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/quiz-night-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/quiz-night-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Our quiz night results -- who knows what place we finished/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nAfter the pub quiz, we decided to take a cab home since it was late. The cost wasn't too prohibitive since there were three of us to split the bill. I think it came out to just 2-3 euros each.\r\n\r\nAs I expected, this post already feels way too long. I was hoping I could cover each leg of the trip in one post, but this feels like a good stopping point. In Barcelona part 2, we visit Park Guell and the Sagrada Familia.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/\r\n [2]: http://www.freehostelsbarcelona.com/\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/day1_penis.jpg\r\n [4]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/centrodelas_arenas.jpg\r\n [5]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/bubbleguy.jpg\r\n [6]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/fountain.jpg\r\n [7]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/church.jpg\r\n [8]: http://roytang.net/2013/03/scenes-from-a-quiz-night/\r",

I say \"well-known\" but I'll be the first to admit that my culturally-ignorant self had not heard of him before, but he's kind of a big deal in Barcelona with many souvenir shops sporting some thing reminiscent of his works. My travelling companions seemed to know what they were doing, so I generally deferred to them when we planned out the day during breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe park was some 4 to 5 kilometers north of our hostel by foot, though as usual we took a more leisurely pace. One of the interesting things we saw along the way was a park-like area near a major thoroughfare where we found a number of old men (and one young man apparently playing hooky on what should be a school day) playing some sort of game which involved tossing metal balls around in a sand-covered lot.figure id=\"attachment_1016\" style=\"width: 2048px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1016\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/petanque.jpg\" alt=\"Googling &quot;barcelona street game where old men throw metal balls&quot; tells us this is called Petanque.

As far as we could tell, first they toss a smaller ball that then acts as a target, and they have to lob the larger metal balls as close as possible to the target.\r\n\r\nAfter watching the games for a while, we decided to continue our trek. From this point on the path we were following (provided by Google Maps) started to tread uphill and I started to get a bit tired. Eventually while my two companions were taking a break and looking at something I vanished for a while as soon as I saw a supermercats so that I could buy a bottle of water and recharge a bit. Supermercats are something like a combination of a small grocery store and a convenience store (they're everywhere, and they don't have 7-11s), and they seem to be often run by people of South Asian or Arabic descent. Whenever I see a supermercat, the name makes me visualize some combination of a cat superman who is also half-fish.\r\n\r\nWe continued along the uphill route, through winding paths and eventually up three flights of stone steps at a 45 degree incline, by which time I was pretty tired and was complaining a lot. I was told we were close, so we trucked on and eventually we turned a corner and found a series of outdoor escalators that would have saved us a lot of effort with those stone steps. I glared at the person guiding our route before we all laughed out loud. The entrance to the park area lay just ahead.\r\n\r\nWe climbed up a hilly area that afforded a good view of the city of Barcelona before eventually coming upon a tourist area overlooking a sealed-off area that was actually the roof of the columned area of the park. The park was the first tourist attraction we would pay for, and though my stingy self balked a bit at paying 8 euro for the entrance, it would turn out to be one of the cheapest tourist spots we would enter anyway.\r\n\r\nI have not much to say about the Park itself, given my lack of architectural and artistic vocabulary. There's a large columned area where the roof is lined with what I could describe as shattered plates, an impression which would turn out to be typical of Gaudi's work.figure id=\"attachment_1022\" style=\"width: 2048px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1022\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/park-guell-roof.jpg\" alt=\"The roof of the columned area looks like shattered silverware - Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1367\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/park-guell-roof.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/park-guell-roof-300x200.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/park-guell-roof-1024x684.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/park-guell-roof-449x300.jpg 449w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"The roof of the columned area looks like shattered plates -- Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nThe columned area is surrounded by a gardens area on one side and on the other side an overhang held up by a series of earthy stone columns one of which is carved in the shape of a washer-woman (which took us a few minutes to find). There's also an actual school inside the park (I'm not sure how that works with the entrance fees) so we get to see a playground full of children enjoying themselves as we walk around the side area to get to the actual front of the park.\r\n\r\nThe front gate of the park features two guardhouses that give me the impression of gingerbread houses (though one of them was undergoing renovation). The gate opens to an intricately decorated walkway leading up back to the columned area. By intricately decorated, I mean there's more of the shattered plates designs everywhere.figure id=\"attachment_1023\" style=\"width: 2048px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1023\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/park-guell.jpg\" alt=\"This lizard is kind of a big deal, souvenir shops often have keychains featuring it.

So we decided to take a taxi back to the hostel and rest a bit before heading out to search for some paella.\r\n\r\nWhen we were ready to head out, the person at the hostel reception desk recommended to us a nearby fancy restaurant a couple of corners down that had some good paella so we headed over there. However as our first lesson of how European restaurants actually work, we found out that we were too early as the place would only open at 7:30 pm. This would turn out to be typical in Europe -- most restaurant type places would only be open a few hours during lunch time and again a few hours during dinner time, which was bad news for us since we tended to skip some meals and eat at irregular hours.\r\n\r\nUndaunted, we walked around a bit for an alternative before settling on a small bar that advertised paella at less than 10 euros each. The proprietor turned out to be a Chinese person affording us the opportunity to miscommunicate with him in two languages as he did not speak English. Paella is a Valencian dish although it's also common in Catalonia, so I went with Paella Valenciana (okay, it's also because I eat meat and not seafood)figure id=\"attachment_1025\" style=\"width: 3264px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1025\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paella.jpg\" alt=\"Paella!\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paella.jpg 3264w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paella-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paella-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paella-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Yummy paella!/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nAfter partaking heartily of the delicious paella which took a while to cook, we also ordered some churros with chocolate dip before heading back to the hostel and crashing for the day.\r\n\r\nTuesday March 10th\r\n\r\nWe would be having our fourth breakfast at the hostel by now, so we've kind of gotten to know some of the other guests. One of them is a Japanese woman who speaks clear English; she often brings in fruits from the nearby supermercats during breakfast time. She's apparently a frequent traveler who would be visiting a few other European countries before heading back to Japan. Another person we got to know was Marco, the owner of the hostel. He's a talkative Italian man and upon finding out where we're from and our travel plans he talks to us about how he plans to visit Boracay soon and gives us some tips for visiting Rome.\r\n\r\nWe headed out Tuesday with the intent of visiting the Sagrada Familia and not much else planned. This meant a leisurely walk along the Diagonal road, one of the major thoroughfares running across Barcelona. It's called the Diagonal because it cuts diagonally across what is otherwise Barcelona's orderly-structured regular square street blocks.\r\n\r\nThe Sagrada Familia itself is a church designed by Gaudi, a large somewhat out-of-place structure occupying one of these city blocks. One of the hostel people had told us its' history, about how it was started back in the 1800s and that construction was still ongoing up to now. There's a fee for going inside the church, with the funds contributing to the construction.figure id=\"attachment_1029\" style=\"width: 1538px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1029\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sagrada1.jpg\" alt=\"Sagrada Familia - Under Construction\" width=\"1538\" height=\"865\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sagrada1.jpg 1538w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sagrada1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sagrada1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sagrada1-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1538px) 100vw, 1538px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Sagrada Familia -- Under Construction/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nWe opt not to go inside, as the facade of the church already offers a lot to see. There seemed to be three different facades and numerous spires, each lined with decorations and statues of a different theme.figure id=\"attachment_1030\" style=\"width: 1836px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1030\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sagrada2.jpg\" alt=\"South facade of the Sagrada Familia  - it looks like some sort of Nativity scene\" width=\"1836\" height=\"3264\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sagrada2.jpg 1836w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sagrada2-169x300.jpg 169w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sagrada2-576x1024.jpg 576w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1836px) 100vw, 1836px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"South facade of the Sagrada Familia -- it looks like some sort of Nativity scene/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nWe spent some time admiring the structure, and even a few minutes in an FC Barcelona exhibit right across the street. Afterwards, we headed up a slightly-inclined street towards one of the tourist spots highlighted on our map before deciding to have a late lunch in one of the open air restaurant areas in the middle of the street.\r\n\r\nWe managed to arrive at the Sant Pau hospital knowing nothing about what it is other than it was a nearby spot on our tourist map. The sign outside tells us it's a UNESCO world heritage site, but it doesn't look too impressive from the outside. Nonetheless we paid to go inside and we were surprised to find that it's actually a rather large complex with a number of elaborately-designed buildings inside.figure id=\"attachment_1034\" style=\"width: 2048px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1034\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hospitalsantpau.jpg\" alt=\"Hospital Sant Pau - Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1143\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hospitalsantpau.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hospitalsantpau-300x167.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hospitalsantpau-1024x572.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hospitalsantpau-500x279.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Hospital Sant Pau -- Photo Credit: Ryan Liwanag/figcaption/figure figure id=\"attachment_1035\" style=\"width: 3264px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"img class=\"wp-image-1035 size-full\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-03-10-15.06.41.jpg\" alt=\"2015-03-10 15.06.41\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-03-10-15.06.41.jpg 3264w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-03-10-15.06.41-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-03-10-15.06.41-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/2015-03-10-15.06.41-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Another view of the hospital/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nThis place was a hospital during wartime. It's no longer a hospital though, the hospital was moved to a modern site. It's currently a museum and cultural center and some of the buildings are being used as UNESCO offices. There are almost a dozen buildings lining a central plaza dotted with orange trees. Each building has a different facade, though all in the same style, designed by the Catalan architect Lluís Domènech i Montaner. There was some sort of media event going on though, and we were only able to visit a few of the buildings. The thing about visiting these types of architectural displays is that we're always walking around with our heads tilted upwards.\r\n\r\nWe roamed the grounds for a while before deciding to head back and prep for our flight early the next morning to Rome. Our visit to Barcelona was very relaxed, we weren't too worried about hitting too many tourist spots because we planned to be back here for a few days before flying back to the Southeast Asian side of the world.\r\n\r\nNext: We travel to Rome! Or do we?!?\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/2015/04/europe-2015-barcelona-part-1/\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/petanque.jpg\r\n [4]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/park-guell-roof.jpg\r\n [5]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/park-guell.jpg\r\n [6]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/paella.jpg\r\n [7]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sagrada1.jpg\r\n [8]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/sagrada2.jpg\r\n [9]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/hospitalsantpau.jpg\r",

When we first planned the trip a few months back, only Spain and France were on the itinerary. But due to a last-minute change in circumstances, we decided to add Italy to the trip. We had also acquired a railpass and were planning to travel by train between Spain and France, but given the change of plans we decided to refund the railpass (up to 85% of the cost can be refunded) and we literally booked inter-Europe flights during our layover in Singapore at the start of the trip.\r\n\r\nWe had booked all of our inter-Europe flights on Vueling, a Spain-based budget airline. I was a bit apprehensive about it since internet searches led to some stories of people having trouble with lost baggage, but luckily they were able to get us and our luggage to Rome safely and without incident.\r\n\r\nUpon arrival at the Rome airport, we went to a tourist information kiosk to get some maps and whatnot. While we were there, this Italian man kept wanting to talk to us, offering free information about a shuttle service from the airport. We already had instructions on how to get to the hotel by train, so we ignored him at first and tried to figure out ourselves where to go. Eventually we gave up and just took the shuttle service with a few other travelers. We were the last to get off the shuttle, so we got something of a preview of the different places in Rome as the other passengers were dropped off at their hotels.\r\n\r\nWe were dropped off on a cobblestone sidewalk in front of a four-or-five-story building with a 12-foot tall metal gate in front. We walked in cautiously and found ourselves in a short hallway with a doorway at the end. The old lady who popped up from behind the doorway told us we needed to go up one floor when we told her we were looking for our hotel called Migdal Palace. Another large door on the right side of the hallway led to a stairwell. At the bottom of the stairwell was an old-timey open-air elevator made up of rusty metal bars. We only needed to go up one floor, but what the hell. We rode the small elevator up.\r\n\r\nAt the reception desk, we were greeted by a pretty Italian lady named Alina who spoke with accented yet clear and understandable English. She was very friendly and told us there was a room ready but we would have to wait a bit for the beds to be set up. We had not yet had breakfast at this point, so we asked her the most relevant question: was there a nearby place where we could eat some good pasta?\r\n\r\nShe directed us to a small restaurant at a corner a few blocks from the hotel, the Montecarlo, saying that she ate there all the time. We were a bit early for the lunch hour so we had to wait a few minutes for them to be ready. We were seated at an outdoors table; I ordered some carbonara, since Marco from Freehostels had recommended it, while my two companions ordered cacio e pepe, recommended by Alina at Migdal Palace.\r\n\r\nWhile waiting for the meals to be served we pored over the maps to plan out our Rome trip. We only had 3 days in Rome, so we allocated today for walking around a bit and seeing nearby things, then the next day we would visit the Vatican, and on the third day the Colosseum.figure id=\"attachment_1048\" style=\"width: 3264px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1048\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/carbonara.jpg\" alt=\"Carbonara!\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/carbonara.jpg 3264w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/carbonara-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/carbonara-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/carbonara-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Carbonara!/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nThe carbonara was very good and very cheesy; the sauce was egg-based without cream (as opposed to the cream-based ones I'm used to) and luckily no mushrooms (I dislike mushrooms). I also had a few bites of my friends' cacio e pepe and it was a strange combination of tastes but also very good.\r\n\r\nAfter eating we headed back to the hotel where the beds had already been set up. We rested up for a bit before heading out to explore the city a bit.\r\n\r\nWe made our way through the city, passing by a couple of plazas with small fountains surrounded by a maze of irregularly-arranged cobblestone streets. Rome was easily way more crowded than Barcelona and was very much a tourist city, made obvious by the abundance of shops and street stalls peddling magnets, keychains, miniature roman helmets and other random souvenirs.\r\n\r\nWe visited the Pantheon (an ancient Roman circular domed structure adorned with various exhibits including the remains of the ninja turtle Raphael), the church of Saint Ignatius de Loyola (which would turn out to be the first of many well-decorated churches we would visit) among other places. We made our way to the well-known Trevi Fountain, but unfortunately for us, it was undergoing renovation at this time and was drained of water. We walked around a bit more and late at night we ended up eating at this kinda fancy Italian restaurant which charged us an extra 5 euros for the tablecloth (or at least that what the chef's gestures looked like when we asked him to explain the bill)\r\n\r\nNot too much detail to talk about here, but here are some pictures I shared via Google Plus: Wednesday afternoon in Rome.  (You might need to be logged in to Google to access, I have no idea how this works)\r\n\r\nThursday March 12th\r\n\r\nNext day we availed of the free breakfast served by Migdal Palace, which consisted of bread, croissants, eggs, goat cheese and no meat, which ranks it below the breakfast from Free Hostels. Nonetheless we had our fill before heading out for the day's walking around.\r\n\r\nWe made our way west towards the Tiber river, then followed it north until we crossed the river at the Angel Bridge towards the Castel Sant'Angelo. From there we walked westward along the Via de Conciliazone which would bring us right in front of Vatican City.\r\n\r\nAs we approached the Vatican, a blonde lady started walking with us and offering us details about a tour package she was offering. I wanted to ignore her, but my companions started listening to her so we stopped to hear her spiel. The way she told it, the tour involved us paying 46 euro each and included a 26 euro entrance fee for the Vatican Museum and the tour groups would also have access to a special passage from the Sistine Chapel to the Basilica of St. Peter. While there was no entrance fee for the Basilica, going with a tour group would allow us to skip the ridiculously long line of the tourists waiting to enter the Basilica. However, the fee the lady was offering seemed too rich for our blood so we passed on it and carried on.\r\n\r\nWe reached the border to Vatican City and stood there for a while contemplating how to proceed, and we were approached by another person selling tour packages. This time it was a man of South Asian descent who reminded me of Community's Abed. He got our attention by calling out in Tagalog \"pinakamura dito!\"\r\n\r\nThe tour package he offered us was similar to what the blonde lady had, except he was was offering us a price of 36 euros each, or 10 euros less. While we were contemplating it, we also met with a couple of Filipino expats who were referring people to a nearby souvenir store they were involved with, and they told us the price Abed was offering was already pretty good. After some discussion, we decided to go with it.\r\n\r\nWe were introduced to our tour guide Angelica and handed phone-sized receivers with earphones that we could use to listen to her while she talked about stuff on the tour. We started in front of the Basilica, joined by some white people, and Angelica described to us the history of Rome and Italty and Vatican City and Pope Francis and all that jazz. Pretty informative stuff, but nothing I need to repeat here. After a bunch of these introductions, we would go over to their tour office to pay the fee before heading off to the Vatican Museum.\r\n\r\nAs we were walking towards their tour office, I saw Abed calling me over away from the group, and I walked over to him and he told me that the white people that were part of our tour group had been given a higher price so that we should avoid mentioning how much we are paying. Felt a bit shady, but I guess we were getting a better deal so we ran with it.\r\n\r\nAfter paying at the tour office, we headed over to the Vatican Museum. At that point we found out that the Vatican Museum entrance fee was actually only 16 euro, so I'm not sure why both the blonde lady and Abed said it was 26 euro. Whatever.\r\n\r\nThe Vatican Museum was filled with exhibits featuring statues depicting Roman emperors and other events from Roman history, including statues of Roman gods (which I didn't expect from a Catholic institution). There was also a section filled with Catholic-focused murals and ceiling paintings. Angelica would stop at various exhibits to give us a brief background and history. We stopped at a corner of the pinecone courtyard so that Angelica could give us a briefing on the history of the Sistine Chapel -- apparently they were not allowed to give briefings inside the Sistine Chapel itself. Naturally she had to give us the joke about the missing first fifteen chapels.\r\n\r\nAfterwards we went into the Sistine Chapel itself. No photography was allowed inside so we spent most of the time staring upwards at Michaelangelo's masterpieces on the ceiling (being a tourist in Rome apparently meant looking up a lot).\r\n\r\nAfter the Sistine Chapel, Angelica took our group through the secret passage reserved for tour groups. It brought us to the front entrance of St. Peter's Basilica where the tour ended. Angelica gave us some last words and left us to take a look at the Basilica at our own leisure.\r\n\r\nI'm finding it difficult to find the words to describe the Basilica itself, I guess the most appropriate word to use is grand. We spent one hour walking separately around the Basilica just looking at things (although I did spend some time sitting down since we had been walking through the Vatican Museum for around 3 hours before this). There's just a lot of history and statues and paintings and chandeliers and tombs and relics. As a Catholic it was well worth the visit. On our way out we took some pictures with some Swiss Guard standing by one of the side entrances.\r\n\r\nWe left the Basilica at around 3pm and had a late lunch at a restaurant along the Via de Conciliazone. After that it was still early so we spent a couple more hours walking around checking a few more sites and running into some weird yet entertaining street art. We wanted to visit the Villa Medici, but it was closed on this day. Eventually we got tired and decided to take a taxi back to the hotel and rest.\r\n\r\nSome pictures from this day on Google Plus again: Thursday in Rome.\r\n\r\nTo be continued\r\n\r\nI was hoping to cover all of the Rome leg in one post, but this post is already long enough as it is. It may take at least three more posts to cover everything else, I hope the audience doesn't get tired.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/2015/04/europe-2015-barcelona-part-1/\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/2015/04/europe-2015-barcelona-part-2/\r\n [4]: http://www.agoda.com/migdal-palace/hotel/rome-it.html\r\n [5]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/carbonara.jpg\r\n [6]: https://plus.google.com/101676225200042912359/stories/7bbd6197-2015-3c75-b7a2-a5669d16e00214c0b7dff15?authkey=CJjY1sLljsq35QE\r",

This will be the final entry!\r\n\r\nSunday March 15th\r\n\r\nThis Sunday we took a long walk to visit the famous Louvre museum (why go to Paris and not see the Louvre). The French person behind the ticket booth greeted us in Tagalog when we told him we were from the Philippines. I was pleasantly surprised to find out the audioguide offered for the museum used a Nintendo 3DS XL and a custom cartridge.\r\n\r\nThe museum had a lot of Greek and Roman pieces and of course French artwork. Some of the things I found most interesting follow.figure id=\"attachment_1096\" style=\"width: 640px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"wp-image-1096 size-full\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/wingedvictory.jpg\" alt=\"The Winged Victory of Samothrace.

We walked around a bit more, passing by one of the Paris bridges with love locks all over it. We ended our walk at the famous Notre Dame church; still tired, we passed on the long queue to get into the cathedral and took a taxi back to our hotel to rest up.\r\n\r\nMonday March 16th\r\n\r\nAfter a late breakfast of omelettes at a nearby French cafe, we spent the first half of the day travelling to the Eiffel Tower and hanging out at the base of the tower for a while, near a grassy area where there were a lot of other people just lounging around. We held off on going up the tower, saving it for our last day. Nothing of import happened for the rest of the day.\r\n\r\nTuesday March 17th\r\n\r\nWe had set aside this day to travel to Versailles, which required us to take a longer train ride out of Paris. We took a short walk from the train station to the Chateau, bought our tickets and got audio guides (from which we learned a lot). Some highlights follow.figure id=\"attachment_1104\" style=\"width: 3264px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1104\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/versailles-apollo.jpg\" alt=\"There's a series of rooms with detailed paintings of Greek myths which left me looking up all the time.

We visited the Grand Trianon and Petit Trianon, smaller complexes which were the residence of Marie Antoinette, and spent some time being lost on our way back to the Chateau.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon by the time we finished our tour of the Chateau and the Gardens, well worth the trip. We took the train back to Paris and decided to have an expensive dinner at a fancy French restaurant (one of the few times we decided to splurge on food). I had a French onion soup and a rather large pork chop.\r\n\r\nWednesday March 18th\r\n\r\nAfter eating our last breakfast at the old lady's pattiserie near our hotel, we took the Metro to the Montmarte hill overlooking Paris and famous for the white-domed Basilica of the Sacré Cœur (\"Sacred Heart\"), though we didn't bother going inside the church. We spent some time here listening to a street performer and taking pictures of pigeons (omitted here for brevity, available upon request)figure id=\"attachment_1109\" style=\"width: 10032px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1109\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/montmarte.jpg\" alt=\"Panorama of the view from the Montmarte hill\" width=\"10032\" height=\"3024\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/montmarte.jpg 10032w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/montmarte-300x90.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/montmarte-1024x309.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/montmarte-500x151.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 10032px) 100vw, 10032px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Panorama of the view from the Montmarte hill.

We decided to rest and split up for the remainder of the day and just meet up later in the afternoon for our climb up the Eiffel Tower.\r\n\r\nI took a leisurely afternoon walk to the Eiffel and waited for my companions at the same grassy spot we hung out at before. As the afternoon grew late, the wind grew bitingly cold and I was thankful when they finally arrived so that we could go up the tower.figure id=\"attachment_1110\" style=\"width: 2048px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1110\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/eiffel-281m.jpg\" alt=\"We took the train ride to the top of the Eiffel, almost 300m above sea level.

We had booked a different hotel for our last leg, the Charm Suites along Parallel Ave. It turns out the staff were mostly Filipinos so they were very welcoming to us. The 3-person hotel room was easily the best we had booked for the trip. The room was large and came with a large TV, a fridge, a kitchen area with plates, utensils and a stove for cooking and thankfully free wi-fi.\r\n\r\nWe spent the last leg of the trip in decompression mode, mostly relaxing at the hotel room. I was planning to attend a Dragons of Tarkir (MTG) Prerelease that weekend so I took a 30-minute walk Thursday to find the place I would be playing at, which turned out to be in an area filled with shops relevant to my interests: toy stores, book stores, comic stores, etc. I decided to register for the prerelease at Gigamesh, a large sci-fi/fantasy/comic book store with a back room for the tournament.\r\n\r\nBefore the weekend we took a leisurely afternoon/evening walk to the Barcelona coast so that we could make contact with the Mediterranean sea and having seaside paella for dinner.\r\n\r\nI spent Saturday at Gigamesh having a good time playing with Spanish cards at the DTK prerelease. I had spent some time during the past few days studying up on the card lists in Spanish, worried that I would have a tough time with the local players. Most of them understood English well enough though.\r\n\r\nFinally, Sunday was our flight back to Manila through Singapore, and the end of our trip. And the end of this series of posts, I hope you enjoyed it -- I'm not sure I'd be willing to go into such detail again haha. Well, I have a couple more trips planned this year, so let's see what happens there.

Rome is chock-full of cobblestone roads and plazas lined with souvenir shops and pizzerias and buildings fronted by 12-foot-high steel doors with large lion-head knockers and churches liberally sprinkled every other block. One of the churches we passed through was the Santa Maria in Cosmedin church which featured the Bocca del Verita/Mouth of Truth, made famous by the 1953 film Roman Holiday. There's a short queue outside the church for tourists wanting to take a picture at the Mouth of Truth.figure id=\"attachment_1072\" style=\"width: 638px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1072\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/mouthoftruth.jpg\" alt=\"Supposedly if you lie with your hand inside the mouth, you will lose your hand.

It used to be the site of ancient Roman chariot races. For some reason, I decided to pick up a rock from the field and take it back home as a souvenir (hopefully not illegal LOL)figure id=\"attachment_1074\" style=\"width: 3264px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"wp-image-1074 size-full\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/circusmaximus.jpg\" alt=\"circusmaximus\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/circusmaximus.jpg 3264w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/circusmaximus-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/circusmaximus-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/circusmaximus-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"The Circus Maximus reminds me of the UP Sunken Garden, although it is significantly longer/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nAfter that we arrived at the Colosseum itself. Outside the Colosseum were the usual merchants selling various souvenirs including replica Roman soldier helmets and swords. I asked the merchant how much one of them was an he jokingly told me it was one million euro. There were some people offering guided tours, but we decided to go our own this time. The ticket price was 16 euro for a combination ticket that gave us access to the Colosseum and the nearby Palatino Hill and Roman forum.figure id=\"attachment_1078\" style=\"width: 3264px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1078\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colo-outside.jpg\" alt=\"The outside of the Colosseum - the pillars are riddled with holes\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colo-outside.jpg 3264w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colo-outside-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colo-outside-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colo-outside-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"The outside of the Colosseum -- the pillars are riddled with holes/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nThe Colosseum had a few exhibits inside showing artifacts recovered from the site that gave insights as to how the ancient Romans enjoyed the games, including graffiti from the stone seats depicting Roman gladiators and pots and pans indicating the audience cooked meals while watching.figure id=\"attachment_1077\" style=\"width: 3264px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1077\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colo-inside.jpg\" alt=\"There's a mess of tunnels underneath what used to be the Colosseum floor - they raised up animals using trapdoor platforms from this level\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colo-inside.jpg 3264w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colo-inside-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colo-inside-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colo-inside-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"There's a mess of tunnels underneath what used to be the Colosseum floor -- they raised up animals using trapdoor platforms from this level/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nThe Colosseum has three levels and a basement level, although our ticket did not allow us access to the basement. It was thankfully a rather warm day although still a bit windy, as we spent some time going around the first and second levels. I had to resist the urge to shout \"ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?!?\"\r\n\r\nJust across the street from the Colosseum and up an inclined road was the entrance to the Palatine Hill and Roman Forum. We head up the elevated area first to go around the gardens and building ruins of the former palace. We were already a bit tired by this point and climbing up the hill was exhausting but it did afford us a good elevated view of the Colosseum and the nearby sights.figure id=\"attachment_1080\" style=\"width: 3264px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1080\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/palatino.jpg\" alt=\"The view overlooking the Roman forum and nearby ruins\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/palatino.jpg 3264w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/palatino-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/palatino-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/palatino-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"The view overlooking the Roman forum and nearby ruins/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nWe wasted some time trying to figure out the correct path to climb down the hill (we totally weren't lost!) At the base of the hill we visited the ruins of the Roman Forum (disappointingly, it was just a bunch of stones) and we also visited a couple of temples before deciding that we were too tired to look at everything. Tapped out, we tried to figure out where the exit was.\r\n\r\nWe walked back to our hotel, stopping for a late lunch of sandwiches at a small corner shop and later on at a gelato place along the way where the young woman behind the register somehow managed to figure out we were fellow Filipinos while we perused the menu.\r\n\r\nIt was still early, but since we had a late lunch that day so my companions didn't want to go have dinner any more. But I felt like while I was in Rome I should eat more pasta so I headed out into the chilly night and decided to return to the Montecarlo and I had some gnocchi despite not being too hungry (it was still pretty good!) After dinner, I headed back to hotel and we rested up for the trip to Paris the next morning.\r\n\r\nSaturday March 14th\r\n\r\nAfter a slight scare with a delay in finding our check-in luggage, we took a taxi from the ORLY airport in Paris to our hotel. The taxi turned out more expensive than we had expected, but I think by that time we were at a point in the trip that we were more willing to spend than be tired.\r\n\r\nOur hotel was the Hotel Camelia International on Rue Darcet. We were greeted at the lobby by a grumpy-looking one-legged Frenchman who reminded me of Ray's father from Everybody Loves Raymond. He confirmed our reservation and gave us keys for our room on the sixth floor, instructing us to use the lift. The lift turned out to be able to carry only two people at the time, so we had to take two trips. The room itself was mostly just the three beds crammed into a tight space. The bathroom/toilet had no lock and if you were sitting on the bidet, the door would slam right into you when it opened. The room had no wi-fi -- you would need to go sit at the common area in front of the reception to use the wifi. We did not take the breakfast option at this hotel, which turned out to be a good idea, as it turned out later to be only a croissant and coffee. While pleasant enough, the place was easily the worst among the places we stayed at during the trip.\r\n\r\nAfter a bit of rest we headed out to find something to eat and ended up ending at a restaurant serving South-Asian style food where I had some sort of shawarma type of thing. As usual while eating we planned out our day: we decided today to visit at least the Arc de Triomphe and the Champs-Elysees.\r\n\r\nParis wasn't like Rome with all the crowds and tourist spots so close together, it was closer to Barcelona with wide streets and lots of open spaces. Like Rome, there seemed to be no skyscrapers in Paris; we passed by what seemed to be residential neighborhoods lined with trees coming back from winter cut in identical patterns. We arrived at the rotunda surrounding the Arc de Triomphe and we took the tunnel to cross the road to the island where it was. We decided not to pay the fee to climb the Arc since we were planning to climb the Eiffel later on and we would get a better view from there.\r\n\r\nFrom there we made our way to the Champs-Elysees. I wasn't sure what I expected, but it was full of fancy, high-end shops. Lots of tourists too. We only went into a couple of shops (I'm not really into shopping). The wind was brisk and cold as we made our way down the avenue; eventually we moved past the area full of shops and arrived at a couple of museums adorned with gilded fences and statues of angelic hosts, I believe one of them was the Grand Palais.\r\n\r\nFrom there we walked a bit south until we were at the Seine near the Pont Alexandre, a well-decorated bridge which gave us a good view of the Eiffel Tower in the distance. The bridge was surrounded by pillars on each end with ornate gold statues atop them. Apparently this bridge is a popular location for prenup pics; we counted no less than 6 couples in tuxedos and wedding gowns having their pictures taken on or near the bridge.figure id=\"attachment_1087\" style=\"width: 3264px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1087\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pontalexander.jpg\" alt=\"The bridge gives us a good view of the Eiffel Tower in the distance\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pontalexander.jpg 3264w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pontalexander-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pontalexander-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pontalexander-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"The bridge gives us a good view of the Eiffel Tower in the distance/figcaption/figure figure id=\"attachment1086\" style=\"width: 3264px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"img class=\"size-full wp-image-1086\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/goldenstatue.jpg\" alt=\"One of the golden statues watching over the Pont Alexander\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/goldenstatue.jpg 3264w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/goldenstatue-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/goldenstatue-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/golden_statue-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"One of the golden statues watching over the Pont Alexander/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nIt was almost dusk by then so we started to make our way back to the hotel. We make our way through a maze of streets named after different capital cities, passing near the La Madeleine church. By this time night had rolled around and the buildings and restaurants are illuminated in various shades of neon. We arrive at the hotel late at night, and we turn in early in preparation for more walking around the next day.\r\n\r\nNext: The Louvre and The Versailles\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2015/03/europe-trip-2015/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/2015/04/europe-2015-barcelona-part-1/\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/2015/04/europe-2015-barcelona-part-2/\r\n [4]: http://roytang.net/2015/04/europe-2015-rome-and-vatican-city/\r\n [5]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/mouthoftruth.jpg\r\n [6]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/circus_maximus.jpg\r\n [7]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colo-outside.jpg\r\n [8]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/colo-inside.jpg\r\n [9]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/palatino.jpg\r\n [10]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/pont_alexander.jpg\r",

Modern is a difficult format to prepare for; there are many decks to prepare for and it's almost impossible to master all the matchups. For this reason, I felt much less prepared for this event than for GP Manila back in January. I put together Grixis Twin for this event. It's a bit difficult to pilot, but I felt it had a reasonable matchup across the board and there's always a chance of comboing out when you're falling behind. Here's the list I played:\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist title=\"Grixis Twin\" }}\r\n  \r\n[Creatures]\r\n  \r\n4 Deceiver Exarch\r\n  \r\n1 Pestermite\r\n  \r\n2 Tasigur, Golden Fang\r\n  \r\n3 Snapcaster Mage\r\n  \r\n[/Creatures]\r\n  \r\n[Spells]\r\n  \r\n4 Splinter Twin\r\n  \r\n4 Serum Visions\r\n  \r\n2 Inquisition of Kozilek\r\n  \r\n4 Remand\r\n  \r\n1 Electrolyze\r\n  \r\n4 Lightning Bolt\r\n  \r\n1 Dispel\r\n  \r\n2 Terminate\r\n  \r\n2 Spell Snare\r\n  \r\n1 Kolaghan's Command\r\n  \r\n2 Cryptic Command\r\n  \r\n[/Spells]\r\n  \r\n[Lands]\r\n  \r\n4 Island\r\n  \r\n1 Mountain\r\n  \r\n1 Swamp\r\n  \r\n2 Sulfur Falls\r\n  \r\n1 Cascade Bluffs\r\n  \r\n3 Steam Vents\r\n  \r\n1 Blood Crypt\r\n  \r\n1 Watery Grave\r\n  \r\n4 Scalding Tarn\r\n  \r\n3 Polluted Delta\r\n  \r\n1 Bloodstained Mire\r\n  \r\n1 Desolate Lighthouse\r\n  \r\n[/Lands]\r\n  \r\n[Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n1 Izzet Staticaster\r\n  \r\n1 Keranos, God of Storms\r\n  \r\n1 Olivia Voldaren\r\n  \r\n1 Blood Moon\r\n  \r\n2 Anger of the Gods\r\n  \r\n1 Shatterstorm\r\n  \r\n1 Dispel\r\n  \r\n1 Negate\r\n  \r\n1 Jace Architect of Thought\r\n  \r\n1 Murderous Cut\r\n  \r\n2 Spellskite\r\n  \r\n1 Kolaghan's Command\r\n  \r\n1 Sower of Temptation\r\n  \r\n[/Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\nHere's how my day 1 shook out:\r\n\r\nR1 2-0 WIN vs grixis twin\r\nR2 2-1 WIN vs coco elves\r\nR3 1-1 DRAW vs abzan\r\nR4 2-0 WIN vs gw coco\r\nR5 2-0 WIN vs grixis twin\r\nR6 2-1 WIN vs red burn\r\nR7 2-0 WIN vs affinity\r\nR8 1-2 LOSS vs rg tron\r\nR9 1-2 LOSS vs merfolk\r\n\r\nOf course 6-2-1 doesn't qualify for day 2. Getting eliminated in the last 2 rounds makes me feel a bit salty. The draw vs abzan was because I lost game 1 and boarded into grindy control. I'm not sure if I should have tried to quickly win game 2 first. The loss to RG tron was close; if I had won the die roll I think I would have taken the match, although I did make some sloppy plays in game 3 as well. Merfolk was an uphill battle -- this was one of the matchups I had not prepared for and it seems horribly bad for my side. Game 1 he had the first turn Aether Vial, which seemed to be unbeatable. I managed to eke out a win game 2 after a timely Anger of the Gods and finally running out his Vapor Snags so I could combo off. Cursecatcher + Spell Pierce kept me off Anger of the Gods in game 3 long enough for a 2nd and 3rd lord to push through lethal damage.\r\n\r\nThe problem of course with not making day 2 is that one doesn't really plan on it, so you're never sure what to do on Sunday. I skipped out on the Sunday Super Series and instead decided to play some Chaos Sealed on Sunday afternoon.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1123\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-06-28-14.41.46.jpg\" alt=\"2015-06-28 14.41.46\" width=\"3264\" height=\"1836\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-06-28-14.41.46.jpg 3264w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-06-28-14.41.46-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-06-28-14.41.46-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/2015-06-28-14.41.46-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 3264px) 100vw, 3264px\" /\r\n\r\nGiven the Champions of Kamigawa, Worldwake and Rise of Eldrazi packs of course one would hope for some significant value like Jace the Mindsculptor or maybe even just a Sensei's Divining Top or some such.

At least I got a Jace Architect of Thought and an Ojutai Soul of Winter which were good enough to get me 4 wins in 5 rounds of swiss.

This will be the most GP events I've played in a one year period. I didn't have time to practice, so I went with an updated version of the Jeskai tempo deck I was playing at the start of Khans rotation.\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist title=\"Jeskai Tempo\" }}\r\n  \r\n[Creatures]\r\n  \r\n4 Jace, Vryn's Prodigy\r\n  \r\n3 Soulfire Grand Master\r\n  \r\n2 Harbinger of the Tides\r\n  \r\n4 Mantis Rider\r\n  \r\n2 Stormbreath Dragon\r\n  \r\n[/Creatures]\r\n  \r\n[Spells]\r\n  \r\n2 Wild Slash\r\n  \r\n4 Lightning Strike\r\n  \r\n3 Stoke the Flames\r\n  \r\n2 Jeskai Charm\r\n  \r\n2 Valorous Stance\r\n  \r\n2 Dig Through Time\r\n  \r\n3 Ojutai's Command\r\n  \r\n1 Negate\r\n  \r\n1 Sarkhan Dragonspeaker\r\n  \r\n[/Spells]\r\n  \r\n[Lands]\r\n  \r\n3 Flooded Strand\r\n  \r\n3 Temple of Triumph\r\n  \r\n3 Temple of Epiphany\r\n  \r\n4 Shivan Reef\r\n  \r\n3 Battlefield Forge\r\n  \r\n4 Mystic Monastery\r\n  \r\n2 Island\r\n  \r\n1 Plains\r\n  \r\n2 Mountain\r\n  \r\n[/Lands]\r\n  \r\n[Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n1 End Hostilities\r\n  \r\n1 Tragic Arrogance\r\n  \r\n3 Anger of the Gods\r\n  \r\n3 Disdainful Stroke\r\n  \r\n1 Negate\r\n  \r\n2 Revoke Existence\r\n  \r\n1 Keranos\r\n  \r\n3 Arashin Cleric\r\n  \r\n[/Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\nI was really hoping to run into a lot of monored or UR Artifacts -- basically the PT Origins metagame. Unfortunately the metagame had already reacted the week before. Here's how my day 1 shook out:\r\n\r\nR1 0-2 LOSS vs Abzan Control (mull to 6 and mull to 5)\r\nR2 2-0 WIN vs RG Monsters (mull to 6 in game 1)\r\nR3 2-1 WIN vs Abzan Control\r\nR4 2-1 WIN vs Abzan Megamorph (mull to 6 in game 2)\r\nR5 0-2 LOSS vs Abzan Megamorph\r\nR6 0-2 LOSS vs Temur Dragons\r\nDROP\r\n\r\nI was expecting to be slightly ahead on Abzan decks in general, but my lack of practice turned that into a 50-50 proposition instead. I made a lot of sequencing errors and play mistakes (and felt like I had too many mulligans). I lost the Temur match due to being too aggressive (and not understanding how Thunderbreak Regent worked lol).\r\n\r\nThe thing about competitive Magic is that both proper deck selection and practice both matter. For all three of the GPs I played in, my deck was a good choice -- unlike previous years where I basically slapped together whatever I could based on card availability. My best performance this year was in Manila back in January since I had a lot of practice for that. I played in a number of trials beforehand and had regular playtest sessions with a small group. For Singapore in June, I had a bit less preparation; I only played two trials and a shorter playtest period, and I almost made day 2, dropping the last 2 rounds. For London, it was week 2 of the season and I was in a foreign land so I didn't have any chance for any sort of preparation.\r\n\r\nLosing at competitive Magic is a downer. Well, competitive anything really. It's a problem with being a spike haha. It makes me question whether I'm going to keep doing it -- you get a high from competing and winning and eking out close victories, but losing makes you question whether all the prep effort is worth it. I guess it's a matter of finding the fun in it again, and the drive to keep playing. We'll see.\r\n\r\nI played a sealed after dropping out of the main event, but only managed to win 4 boosters. I also played the SSS on Sunday, but scrubbed out again. I quit the weekend after that, since it felt like I was on tilt and was dead tired. So the GP was a bust, but at least there was swag!\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1136\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/11889502101540220992239126484358864581399871n.jpg\" alt=\"11889502101540220992239126484358864581399871n\" width=\"960\" height=\"717\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/11889502101540220992239126484358864581399871n.jpg 960w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/11889502101540220992239126484358864581399871n-300x224.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/11889502101540220992239126484358864581399871_n-402x300.jpg 402w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2015/02/grand-prix-manila-2015/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/2015/06/gp-singapore-2015/\r",

And to believe the best of people, or at least try to. It's not always easy. Sometimes people disappoint you. Sometimes you feel lost. Or stressed. Or stuck in a rut.

And to be able to appreciate the good things in your life.\r\n\r\nDespite some bad spots, I've still had a pretty good twelve months though. I've traveled a lot, and plan to travel more before the year ends. I'm still learning new things. I'm still blessed with good family and friends and a means to sustain myself and my wants.\r\n\r\nMy birthday always feels like a good opportunity to step back and take a breather and find some perspective. And to re-affirm the choice to keep moving forward -- one step at a time... \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r",

As per usual, I am more than an hour early before the check-in time for my flight. It's a thing I do, no matter where I'm travelling, that I put in lots of buffer time so I will more often than not arrive way too early and need to wait. It's not just for flights either -- I have a tendency to arrive early for any sort of time sensitive appointment. (Except work of course, where I often take what I call \"tactical lates\", but that's a story for another time)\r\n  \r\nThe buffer time and arriving early is a form of risk management I suppose. Since flights are costly to miss, you have to manage the risks involved. It's also a form of anxiety I guess, something I've been prone to lately -- worrying about all the things that could go wrong. I'm especially familiar with travel anxiety given how much I've travelled this year -- this is now my fourth time flying out of the country for a while. I plan to go easy on the air travel next year, I'm kind of burned out a bit by it. Not that I don't like visiting new places, but as I mentioned above there's a lot of anxiety around it. Some sources of anxiety are:\r\n  \r\nTraffic. Metro Manila right now is one of the worst (if not outright the worst) city in the world with regards to traffic. On a normal day, you're pretty much rolling the dice on any estimate of travel time as the traffic will randomly grind to a halt unexpectedly. And I just happened to be travelling during the week that we are hosting the APEC summit, which means random road closures and traffic congestion in the southern part of the metro where the city lies. Granted, I'm targetting to arrive at the airport a bit after midnight so the risk of a traffic jam is very low, but I'd prefer not to roll the dice\r\n  \r\nFlight cancellations; this is pretty much a unique risk during APEC week as a number of flights have been cancelled due to visiting dignitaries and security and whot not. There is supposedly a no-fly zone on the airport until the last day of the conference, and I'm flying out on the last day. My flight wasn't on the cancellation list, but I couldn't get a straight answer from any of the official channels whether the no fly zone would affect me. The airline's helpline just kept me on hold for a while, not enough to hold my patience when I just wanted to confirm my flight eill push throu. Given it's an early morning flight, the risk is again low, but still someing to think about.\r\n  \r\nScams. Before APEC and the Paris terrorist attacks took over the local news cycle, one of the big causes of worry for travellers was the so-called \"laglag bala\" scam where unscrupulous airport staff would plant bullets in your luggage and proceed to extort you when they are detected at the xray machine. I don't seem to be the target audience, but I plan to check in my luggage to minimize the odds of such problems occuring. It's a shameful issue but the good news is that it has brought to light the sheer incompetence of officials in the transport department.\r\n  \r\nForgetfulness. There's always a risk that you arrive at the airport and realise you forgot something important and have to go back. My mom likes to tell the story of hpw she once almost left for the airport to travel to Vietnam and had to go back home because she forgot her passport of all things. Or even worse, what if you travel to a foreign country and realise you forgot to pack any socks? Or underwear? (Not a true story). Nowadays I always prepare a checklist ahead of time of what I plan to bring, to minimise the risk of forgetting things. Of course, you need to remember to check the list again on the way back home -- during my last trip home I left my phone charger at the flat we were staying at and had to double back for it\r\n  \r\nAccommodations/getting lost. This is more of a problem when you've already arrived at your destination and there's some problem with the accommodations you've planned out. Maybe there was a problem with the booking or you got lost on the way there. For the first night on this particular trip, I'm staying alone at an airbnb in a country that isn't primarily English-speaking. It's also my first time using airbnb. So I have a number of things to worry about: will I be able to find the place? Will I be able to communicate well with the owner? Will he murder me in my sleep? (Ok I guess the risk of that last one is probably pretty low)\r\n  \r\nFlight problems. Well, I don't have a fear of flying per se, but I can imagine some people might, especially given how there's a lot more incidents of flight problems, crashes or even disappearances happening latly. I would guess it's pretty much a product of the information age\r\n  \r\nWell, worrying too much about all of these things isn't helpful of course. It's a habit I have to rid myself of -- I need to learn the right amount of worrying that's appropriate enough to manage the risks, but not enough to drive myself crazy. After all, one of the reasons for travelling is a sense of adventure and to anxiety so I should learn to let go of my worries and enjoy being out of my comfort zone for a while",

But then I thought to myself: if Singapore has such low taxes, where does the government get their operating budget from? Are they simply 20 times more efficient in using their money? I had time, so I thought I'd do a bit of research. (I'm just pulling figures off the internet and using what limited understanding I have of economics so feel free to correct me where I am probably embarassingly wrong)\r\n\r\na href=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12043087101535364210453255066434483020033369n.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1145\"img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1145\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12043087101535364210453255066434483020033369n.jpg\" alt=\"12043087101535364210453255066434483020033369n\" width=\"450\" height=\"491\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12043087101535364210453255066434483020033369n.jpg 450w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12043087101535364210453255066434483020033369_n-275x300.jpg 275w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 450px) 100vw, 450px\" //a\r\n\r\nFirst off, 1M pesos annual salary = around 30,000 sgd (more or less, let's just make the math easy). According to the table from the original article (https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/highest-income-tax-rates-world-160000035.html), that's the second lowest tax bracket (200sgd + 3.5% of the excess over 30k sgd). While the 240,000php annual salary is in the third highest bracket for the Philippines, taxed at 20%. Obviously Singapore has a lower tax rate than we do, but it seems a bit disingenuous to be comparing one of the lowest brackets with one of the highest. The highest tax brackets are 20% for Singapore and 32% for the Philippines\r\n\r\nThe comparison was a bit exaggerated, but that's fine. Singapore tax rates are lower. How much money do they collect? According to http://www.singaporebudget.gov.sg/budget_2015/RevenueandExpenditure.aspx, it was some 61B SGD (around 2T PHP) in 2014. For a population of 5.67M, it comes out to roughly 11K SGD (362k PHP) per capita. Roughly 36% of that was corporate and personal income tax (which I assume are the ones levied as a portion of income)\r\n\r\nFor the Philippines, revenue was at 1332B PHP in 2014 (source: http://www.bir.gov.ph/images/bir\\files/annual\\reports/annual\\report\\2014/cmtt.html) for a population of 100M, roughly 13k PHP per capita. Roughly 58% of that was for taxes on net income (which I assume includes both corporate and personal income tax)\r\n\r\nSo: Singapore has lower tax rates, but they manage to collect almost 3x as much money per citizen somehow, and less of it is from income taxes. As far as I can tell, complaining about the poor quality of service vis-a-vis the tax rate is ridiculous given the PH government has almost 20x as many people to serve and is earning only around 2/3rds the revenue). The Singapore government can afford to provide better services because their citizens earn more money and hence the government earns more money, despite the lower tax rates. Even if we were able to utilize all the govt revenue 100% (with nothing lost to corruption/inefficiency), we'd still have only 4% as much to spend on services per capita as compared to the SG government. As pointed out by a friend, SG also has a much smaller area to govern and hence much lower expected expenditures.a href=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/12043087101535364210453255066434483020033369_n.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1145\"br / /a\r\n\r\nSo it's not a straightforward \"we should be getting better services because we have a higher tax rate!\". We still need to build up our economy so that we can support lower tax rates without giving up too much in social services. At the very least, comparing ourselves with Singapore is an apples and oranges type of deal",

One of them has been sketching. I've been drawing things for as long as I remember -- I have elementary and high school notebooks with more doodles and x-men drawings than there are notes. And even at work, I often find other meeting participants checking out the random sketches I had been absently doing while other people were speaking.\r\n\r\nI started following this subreddit SketchDaily. What they do is they have a bot post a daily theme (submitted by other users) and users post their sketches for others' comments. \"Sketches\" is a wide-ranging term here, submissions can be anything -- redditors will typically post sketches with a wide range of skillsets (some are beginners and some quite advanced) and mediums (some do real-life paper sketches or inked and colored drawings, others do digital stuff drawn on tablets or with photoshop).\r\n\r\nIf you follow me on Instagram (@roytang0400, it's funny how I got that account, but that's a story for another day), you know I've been posting my sketches for a bit more than a month now. I haven't written a blog post in a while, so I thought I'd post about this and maybe show a bit of how I do my sketches. I'm not super talented or anything, although I like to think I'm not a beginner.\r\n\r\nFor March 15th, the theme posted on r/SketchDaily was \"Lots of Dinosaurs\". I usually try to relate the theme to a pop culture thing I'm familiar with -- something from movies, TV or video games. Since I'm a big Transformers fan, my first instinct was to do a drawing of the Dinobots. I'm not good enough yet to do one from scratch, so I usually search online for an image to use as reference. (I find that my sketches get a bit worse when I don't use a reference)\r\n\r\nI found the following image via Google Images, originally hosted on http://kaiju-kingdom-hearts.wikia.com/wiki/Dinobots:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/kaiju-kingdom-hearts/images/3/3d/Dinobotsroarby_kevinraganit-d5fx2sa.png/revision/latest?cb=20130130175814\" alt=\"\" width=\"841\" height=\"640\" /\r\n\r\nThe five Dinobots (if you are ignorant) are Grimlock (center, T-Rex), Snarl (bottom left, Stegosaurus), Slag/Slug (bottom right, triceratops, he was renamed to Slug in later versions because apparently Slag had negative connotations somewhere), Sludge (top right, apatosaurus), and Swoop (top left, pteranodon)\r\n\r\nI usually start by doing a light-pencil sketch of a rough outline and layout:\r\n\r\na href=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315204514-e1458055295385.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1151\"img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1151 size-large\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315204514-e1458055295385-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"20160315204514\" width=\"840\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315204514-e1458055295385-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315204514-e1458055295385-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315204514-e1458055295385-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315_204514-e1458055295385-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" //a\r\n\r\nI'm drawing on a cheap sketchpad I bought for like 50 pesos using a 2B pencil. I usually just take pictures of my submissions using my cellphone camera, which explains the shadow near the bottom. I started out placing Grimlock's head then placing the other Dinobots around him. It turned out that I had made Grimlock's head a bit too big which meant I didn't have room to place the other Dinobots exactly as they were in the reference image, I had to bunch them up closer (Sludge is mostly just a neck and head now), but that's fine. Too lazy to start over.\r\n\r\nOnce I have the initial light-pencil sketch, I draw in some heavier lines. I start with Grimlock in the center:\r\n\r\na href=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315210755-e1458055775333.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1153\"img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1153 size-large\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315210755-e1458055775333-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"20160315210755\" width=\"840\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315210755-e1458055775333-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315210755-e1458055775333-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315210755-e1458055775333-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315_210755-e1458055775333-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" //a\r\n\r\nThen Snarl and Slag on either side:\r\n\r\na href=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315213816-e1458055871892.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1154\"img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1154 size-large\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315213816-e1458055871892-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"20160315213816\" width=\"840\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315213816-e1458055871892-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315213816-e1458055871892-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315213816-e1458055871892-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315_213816-e1458055871892-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" //a\r\n\r\nThen the last two, Swoop and Sludge:\r\n\r\na href=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315215206-e1458055960116.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1155\"img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1155 size-large\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315215206-e1458055960116-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"20160315215206\" width=\"840\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315215206-e1458055960116-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315215206-e1458055960116-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315215206-e1458055960116-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315_215206-e1458055960116-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" //a\r\n\r\nNow, usually I'd stop at this stage and maybe polish a bit more (Grimlock probably needs an Autobot symbol on the chest) and just submit it to reddit already. But the problem with this sketch when I look at it, it's hard to tell the Dinobots apart -- like in the image above, it's hard to tell where Grimlock ends and Snarl begins.\r\n\r\nSo just this once, I thought I'd try adding some colors to the sketch. I'd never done it before, but my mom was into the whole adult coloring book fad so she had some colored pencils lying around for me to use.\r\n\r\nAgain I started with Grimlock:\r\n\r\na href=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315221453-e1458056205201.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1156\"img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1156 size-large\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315221453-e1458056205201-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"20160315221453\" width=\"840\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315221453-e1458056205201-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315221453-e1458056205201-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315221453-e1458056205201-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315_221453-e1458056205201-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" //a\r\n\r\nAnd then the rest:\r\n\r\na href=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315224636-e1458056290857.jpg\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1157\"img class=\"aligncenter wp-image-1157 size-large\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315224636-e1458056290857-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"20160315224636\" width=\"840\" height=\"473\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315224636-e1458056290857-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315224636-e1458056290857-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315224636-e1458056290857-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/20160315_224636-e1458056290857-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 840px) 100vw, 840px\" //a\r\n\r\nOkay, it didn't really improve telling the Dinobots apart by that much. Maybe only a little bit. At this point I've already spent way more time than I normally do on this (I was already on one and a half hours, most days it takes me less than half an hour), so the I went ahead and submitted the above image to reddit.\r\n\r\nThe above isn't representative of what I do with all of the sketches. For one, this output is way more detailed than my usual ones. And the process varies slightly depending on what I'm drawing. I will usually always have the preliminary light-pencil sketch. Sometimes for drawing real-life people, I'll want to do an outline trace, which means overlaying the paper over an image I want to draw (usually on the iPad) and lightly tracing the outline with pencil. It feels a bit like cheating, but real-life faces are hard enough without it. Maybe someday I won't have to do them anymore (although I've only traced like 3 sketches I think). And as mentioned, I don't usually do the coloring -- and I probably won't do it again, takes too much time.\r\n\r\nI'm still not sure how far I'm taking this hobby. I have no ambitions of becoming a professional or anything (a friend once commented he was scrolling through his instagram feed with famous artists like Leinel Yu and one of my drawings was interspersed and surprised him LOL), but like life, I'll just see how it goes I guess.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/sketchdaily\r",

With recent events I've found myself getting into more discussions, debates and otherwise friendly arguments online. The quality of these interactions hasn't always been the best, and many times I feel like I should have stopped engaging sooner or maybe not participated at all. I've considered some points to help me decide in the future whether to bother engaging other people online.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I've always been both used to and biased in favor of vibrant and open debate and discussion. And I'm happy to say many of my closest friends are of the same temperament. But one thing I've learned is that many people don't like their views being criticized. For some people, posting on the internet is putting themselves out there and risking being criticized (as if receiving criticism were a bad thing in and of itself!). I do think that more people voicing their opinions can only be a good thing, so maybe we can try not to be so aggressive when we know the person doesn't like criticism or isn't used to an open debate. \" I understand that you believe that, although have you considered the studies that say ... \"figure id=\"attachment_1222\" style=\"width: 836px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1222\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/discussion.jpg\" alt=\"(Image cribbed from a friend)\" width=\"836\" height=\"836\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/discussion.jpg 836w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/discussion-150x150.jpg 150w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/discussion-300x300.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/discussion-768x768.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 836px) 100vw, 836px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"(Image cribbed from a friend)/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nAccept that you are not going to \"win\" any debate. From experience, it is very rare to win a debate on the internet. At best you are going to agree to disagree, or maybe find common ground to agree on and move forward.\r\n\r\nTry to phrase your replies in the form of questions, they are softer and will seem less like an attack. \"Isn't there evidence of claim X?\", \"What credentials does expert Y have?\", \"Don't you think this violate the principles of Z?\"\r\n\r\nTry to see what the other person is looking for. Many people online aren't looking for debate or discussion, they simply want to air their view for others to consider or maybe look for some validation. It can be difficult, sometimes people can pretend to be open to discussion but really just want to reinforce their own views. It's easiest if you already know the person. For example, if the person has a history of not believing easily-verifiable facts, maybe it's better not to engage at all.\r\n\r\n*Know what you are looking for. *Typically, there's one of three things I want out of a discussion: (a) I want to gather more information to help in my own decision-making; or (b) I want to point out misinformation or logical problems; or (c) I want to present my own point of view for others to consider. If you've already met your goals, you can safely consider tapping out \"I just wanted to say that I think X is a better choice. Take that as you will\". Of course sometimes there's a fourth thing I want: just to engage in a lively discussion 😀\r\n\r\nAvoid attacking the other person, even when he/she is obviously being a bloody idiot. Bloody idiots can have opinions too after all. It should be possible to point out logical flaws or misinformation without taking things personally.\r\n\r\n*If you are aiming to convince others to change their position, you should be willing to change yours as well. *Not only is it more sincere, it's also fair. It will make your own arguments more compelling if you can show a willingness to question your own assumptions as well. That being said, you probably only need to employ this if the other people are willing to change their positions too.\r\n\r\n*Don't take things personally, and don't respond to criticism in anger. *If someone says something like your work is cringeworthy, instead of taking offense maybe you can ask the person to elaborate \"Which parts did you find problematic and why?\" If the person is not willing to discuss in detail, maybe it's no longer productive to continue.\r\n\r\nKnow when to tap out of a discussion. You have to learn to recognize when other people are (a) not willing to consider other points of view; or (b) not looking for a debate or discussion or pros and cons. It will usually become obvious once they reply one or two times (sometimes it will be bloody obvious when they say something like \"I believe in X no matter what\"). Unless you are really enjoying the debate (which I am sometimes wont to do!), it's probably not productive anymore to continue discussion. In that case, it's probably better to just agree to disagree and move on.\r\n\r\nI'm probably still going to occasionally dive into a debate just to be a devil's advocate or even just for fun though, but hopefully these guidelines help me (and maybe even you!) recognize when it's unproductive to engage and just to move on.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://xkcd.com/386/\r",

There's a strong use of social media this time around, and it's led to the internet being a hotbed of opinions and propaganda and memes and lies and half-truths and threats of violence. I was hoping greater citizen involvement via social media and the debates would mean citizens have more information and thus would get to be more discerning, but it seems that things have only gotten worse. Hopefully we'll get there someday, but it doesn't look like that day is soon.\r\n\r\nThe presidential race has been particularly difficult, I would generally say this is the worst crop of candidates we've had since I started voting. I cannot find any clearly acceptable candidate, all of them have their own trade-offs. For the discerning voter, it's a matter of which trade-offs you are willing to accept and live with. In fact, at this time, I am still unable to finalize my choice. I will probably decide who I will vote for president when I wake up in the morning on the morning of election day itself. That being said, for sure I will not vote for Binay (should be self-explanatory) or Duterte (risk of instability, too many things I disagree with, including character, foreign policy, diplomacy, etc). For both of the above choices, I feel that the worst-case scenario is significantly worse than the other three.\r\n\r\nGrace Poe, I do not like mainly due to her inexperience, she has the most variance among the remaining candidates. Difficult to predict what happens with a presidency under her, although one can assume it will be reasonably similar to Roxas. I am not actually too concerned with her having been an American citizen (I am not very nationalistic in that regard), and if the SC says she can run, fine (with reservations). I will probably vote for her if I wake up feeling like I want to try to prevent my two negative choices from winning.\r\n\r\nMar Roxas, for all his faults, actually has a reasonable track record (I did vote for him as VP in 2010 on the strength of that record after all). He however suffers the misfortune of working under an administration that despite it's accomplishments, has exhibited poor judgment and poor leadership at certain points over the past six years. As a regular commuter, I am also personally very annoyed at how the administration has handled the traffic situation in Metro Manila (although as one of the other candidates has pointed out, it is a difficult problem that may not be resolved in six years). A vote for Roxas is kind of a safe bet, we can easily assume that his administration will perform similarly to how the previous administration did: some bad spots in leadership, with some accomplishments along the way. It also means living with the traditional politics of the Liberal Party. I will probably vote for Roxas if I wake up feeling neutral or positive (if I wake up with any hate or anger or annoyance, I will vote one of the other two haha)\r\n\r\nMiriam Defensor Santiago, my main issue is her endorsement of Marcos, which for me is a non-starter. That I'm even still considering her for this slot is a testament to how shallow the pool is. She's brilliant and has an excellent track record, and her administration would probably be the most unconventional among the three. She is however, very much a political animal, with her own history of poor political choices here and there. I will probably vote for her if I wake up feeling hipster or contrarian.\r\n\r\nIf I wake up feeling like I cannot stomach any of the above choices, I will shade in Roy Seneres on the ballot (virtual abstain)\r\n\r\nOkay, that was the tough part. The rest of the choices are relatively easy.\r\n\r\nFor Vice President, there is no other choice but Leni Robredo. Full disclosure: My uncle is married to the sister of the late Jesse Robredo, so my family is strongly in favor of Leni anyway (last weekend one of my visiting relatives told me I should be campaigning for her more :p). That being said, I've never met her myself, although my parents have. My choice is based on what I see and hear about her compared to the other choices. Her track record is not as extensive as the others, but her character is unquestionable, and she has been involved in grassroots community work even before she entered public service, and she has had a productive term as congresswoman.\r\n\r\nFor the Senate, just a quick run through:\r\n\r\n  Risa Hontiveros -- I voted for in 2010, still voting for her now.\r\n  Lorna Kapunan -- a newbie, but given one of the likely winners of the presidential race, we will need more Human Rights advocates in the senate\r\n  *Ina Ambolodto *-- some representation for our Mindanao/Muslim brethren. She was recommended by Jesse Robredo to be part of his team in the DILG, a big plus for me\r\n  *Leila de Lima *-- for Justice! Not afraid to go up against influential groups\r\n  Francis Pangilinan -- reasonably good track record, focus on agriculture\r\n  *Joel Villanueva *-- on the strength of his TESDA track record\r\n  *Sherwin Gatchalian *-- I still associate him with some text spam ads during the previous elections, but multiple people have vouched for how he has improved things in Valenzuela, so I'll give him a chance\r\n  Rafael Alunan -- reasonably good track record during the Ramos administration. As a Duterte supporter, he is also my concession to their camp; as an intelligent man I hope he can help keep the mayor's baser instincts in check should he become president\r\n  Dick Gordon -- he's not perfect, and I disagree with his stand on a number of issues, but if I was willing to vote for him as president in 2010, there's no reason not to vote for him now as a Senator where he would have less power\r\n 10. Roman Romulo -- focus on education. He's only here because I'm a sucker for his political ad haha. He also has a reasonable legislative record focused on education\r\n 11. *TG Guingona *-- filling out the slots with a couple of re-electionists. #11 and #12 are soft slots, they are more likely to change depending on my mood during election day. Both of these guys seem to have reasonable track records and I don't mind re-electing them.\r\n 12. Ralph Recto -- see above.\r\n\r\nFor party-list, once again I'm voting for AGHAM. I always heavily favor science and education, because playing Civilization taught me that it's difficult to keep up with other civs if our science % is too low haha.\r\n\r\nFor mayor and vice-mayor, I will grudgingly vote for Bautista **and **Belmonte, who are running virtually unopposed anyway. I'm not too happy with HB and some of his shenanigans, but Quezon City is doing fine anyway.\r\n\r\nFor congressman, I will abstain. Kit Belmonte is running unopposed, but I have no idea of his track record, might as well abstain. I do not know the candidates for councilor either, so I will not vote for any councilors either.\r\n\r\nThings can still change between now and election day, but more or less this will probably be the slate I'm voting for. Despite the fact that I enjoy seeing the shenanigans unfold, I'm tired of this election season and looking forward to it being over just under a week's time. I'm sure that won't be the end of our political circus (far from it), but I expect the toxic atmosphere online to at least maybe lighten up even just a little bit. Hopefully?\r\n\r\nEdit: I was told that I take my votes too seriously. Cannot deny haha. Here's my 2010 post for reference: http://roytang.net/2010/05/elections-2010-my-ballot/",

Over the past year or so I've also been playing Blizzard's digital CCG Hearthstone (limiting myself to free to play since who has money to spend on two CCGs?) and I've been thinking about the design parallels and differences between the two. If you're a Hearthstone player, you've probably read a lot of these things before, since many well-known pros play both MTG and HS. This is written more towards the Magic player in mind to get to know Hearthstone.\r\n\r\nMana system and Mulligans\r\n\r\nLike most modern successors to MTG, HS does away with the concept of \"mana screw\" by automatically providing one generic mana to each player per turn. It's really MTG's big weakness and what turns off many players. MTG Head Designer MaRo tries to justify the existence of mana screw here. HS's mana system is much simpler, and has no concept of colors or mana screw or color screw. One disadvantage of this is that all costs are the same, and they have to restrict deck access to cards via another method -- class-specific cards. This makes it impossible to have the equivalent of a \"multicolor deck\" like in Magic, which means there are theoretically fewer possible deck archetypes in HS for a comparable set of cards.\r\n\r\nI'm a fan of Hearthstone's mulligan system -- selectively sending back particular cards from your opening hand -- as opposed to Magic's sending back the entire hand. Unfortunately, Magic is already balanced around the current mulligan system, and it will probably have issues if you only have one chance to mulligan and still draw no lands.\r\n\r\nHearthstone Limitations\r\n\r\nHearthstone is definitely a more limited game than Magic because it follows one important rule: you can't interact during your opponent's turn. This has the benefit of streamlining matches and making them go faster (no need for concepts like the stack and priority from MTG) , which is important for a game played online. The disadvantage is a greatly reduced design space which HS has to compensate with in other areas.\r\n\r\nThere are some other limitations to streamline/simplify gameplay:\r\n\r\n  No graveyard (well, HS has a concept of \"minions that died this turn\" or \"minions that died this game\", but there is no visible graveyard zone). This means Magic's graveyard-based mechanics such as Flashback or Unearth can't be translated to Hearthstone\r\n  No manual searching through the deck. When an effect pulls something out of the deck, it's always random\r\n  At most 7 minions (creatures) on the board on each side\r\n\r\nStrengths of the Digital Format\r\n\r\nDespite the above limitation, HS does earn some additional design space since it takes advantage of the exclusively digital format in a number of ways not available to Magic, such as:\r\n\r\n  Damage to minions not healed at EOT -- in Magic, this would not have been practical since it's a lot of effort for players to track the damage to individual creatures. For a digital game it's easy since it can be done automatically. This also provides some mechanics that can't usefully translate to MTG: the Enrage mechanic and effects like \"Draw a card for each damanged minion\"\r\n  Effects can generate new cards -- both spells and minions. Magic can do this too, through the use of \"tokens\" (but only for permanents, not spells). Magic's tokens however are \"second-class\" permanents since they are not real cards. In HS, the generated cards are real cards that can be returned to hand, shuffled into your deck, etc. Furthermore, the generated cards can be either existing cards (whether you have them in your deck or not -- Discover mechanic or effects like Piloted Shredder) or cards that are not even available for deckbuilding such as the Spare Parts generated by some mechs\r\n  More randomly generated elements -- Magic has some RNG too, but not nearly as much as HS. I believe that in both games, serious competitive players don't like too much RNG.\r\n  Effects can permanently boost cards not in play -- this includes effects like \"all cards in your deck get +1/+1\" or \"reduce the cost of this card for each turn it is in your hand\". This is possible since we can trust the game engine to correctly process and track hidden information\r\n  *Board position matters *-- minions can grant bonuses to adjacent minions, or effects can target the leftmost minion, etc. Actually, Magic can do this too, but given that they've moved away from \"graveyard order matters\" because it places too much effort on the player, I suspect they are not likely to do this for similar reasons\r\n  *Easily balance existing cards *-- Blizzard hasn't done it too often, but they do issue nerfs to cards that are too powerful. Before the introduction of the Standard format they even nerfed some core cards to free up future design space. In Magic they try to avoid functional errata because they have no way of ensuring the ifnromation is propagated to all owners of previous printings of the same card\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nHearthstone Mechanics\r\n\r\nHero Power -- **each hero has a power that costs 2 mana. The great thing about this it reduces the effect of \"cost screw\", i.e. drawing high cost cards early, since your hero will always have a low-cost play available no matter what. There's also some design space there they started using in earnest with The Grand Tournament expansion, such as the **Inspire mechanic or effects that modify hero powers.\r\n\r\nSecrets -- to compensate for not being able to interact during the opponent's turn, some classes have access to secrets -- these are spells that generate effects during your opponent's turn, based on particular triggers. The opposing player wouldn't know\r\n\r\n*Taunt *-- the equivalent of Taunt in MTG is \"Blocking\". Since you cannot do anything on your opponent's turns, blocking the same way as MTG is impossible, so they have this mechanic to replace it. Currently, HS has no way for minions to bypass Taunt without removing the Taunt minion itself -- there are no evasion mechanics.\r\n\r\nCharge **-- the equivalent of MTG's **Haste. However, it is stronger here in HS since your opponent cannot interact during your turn. This means Charge creatures essentially get a free attack unopposed and can throw off your opponent's combat math. This makes effects that grant Charge particularly strong. An example was the infamous nerf to Warsong Commander because granting Charge to other creatures enabled one-turn kills.\r\n\r\nDivine Shield -- no equivalent in MTG, but I think something can be worked out if needed. Something like:\r\n\r\n Divine Shield (This creature enters the battlefield with a divinity counter on it. Whenever it takes damage and has a divinity counter instead remove a divinity counter.)\r\n\r\nI'm actually a big fan of Divine Shield as a mechanic, it's more interesting and a lot simpler than Magic's defensive mechanics Protection or Regeneration\r\n\r\nWindfury **-- this is basically the same as Magic's **Double Strike, except Magic is limited by the rules to two strikes, while HS has one card that has Mega-Windfury, allowing four strikes\r\n\r\nOverload **-- this is HS putting its' simpler mana system to good use. Overload allows you to \"borrow\" mana from the future to reduce the costs of your cards. The downside is you have less mana available next turn. The closest equivalent is probably Magic's **Echo mechanic or the \"Pact\" mechanic from the Pact of Negation cycle, although neither are exactly the same\r\n\r\n*Combo *-- this is the Rogue mechanic in HS, it grants an additional effect if at least one other card has been played in the same turn. This is easily implementable in Magic:\r\n\r\n Eviscerate 1R Sorcery Eviscerate deals 2 damage to target creature or player. Combo -- Eviscerate deals 4 damage instead\r\n\r\nIt's no different than Magic's other \"enhancing\" ability words like Morbid or Kicker which grant additional effects depending on certain conditions\r\n\r\nStealth -- this is the same as Magic's Hexproof, except Stealth wears off once the minion attacks, and stealthed minions can't be attacked. The usage is generally the same -- to protect your minion until it can actually gain you some value.\r\n\r\n*Battlecry and Deathrattle *-- in Magic, these are simply triggered abilities \"when the creature enters the battlefield\" and \"when the creature dies\". If these were named keywords in MTG, it would open up some additional design space that HS already uses. MTG does use this design space sometimes, but the templating is difficult, see Torpor Orb. More complicated abilities like \"Battlecry: Trigger another minion's Deathrattle effect\" would not be worth the effort to implement in MTG unless similar keywords are defined to make templating easier.\r\n\r\nSpell Damage -- this mechanic increases the damage dealt by burn spells. In Magic, such spells are almost exclusively red spells, so I'm not sure how likely it would be to keyworded in Magic. This design space has been used in MTG on occasion, but it's mostly damage doubling instead of incrementing.\r\n\r\n*Choose One *-- I actually wasn't aware this was a named mechanic until they took advantage of it with Fandral Staghelm. Magic's modal mechanic has never been used in such a way, but imagine an effect like \"Whenever you make a choice for a modal ability, you may choose one additional mode\" -- makes your Cryptic Commands way more awesome!\r\n\r\nSilence -- this is basically \"remove all abilities\" in Magic. To be truly equivalent, it should also remove power/toughness boosts and auras attached to the creature. Seems perfectly doable in Magic, although it might have memory issues, unless it's as an aura.\r\n\r\nFreeze -- frozen minions can't attack the next turn. It's mechanically and thematically similar to tapping effects often found in blue and white cards. Freeze effects in HS can easily be replicated in Magic. The main difference is that frozen Taunts in HS can still \"block\" so Freeze can't be used offensively to get rid of the \"blockers\"\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nHearthstone is a pretty young game compared to Magic, but as far as I can tell it's doing pretty well. It provides a fun, streamlined experience and takes advantage of the strengths of the digital format to overcome the weaknesses brought about by the streamlining. The monetization model is friendly enough that even cheap f2p players like me can appreciate it. So far Magic hasn't had a real competitor in the paper space, but HS is a serious competitor in the digital space since it makes MTG's digital offerings look terrible by comparison. Hopefully both games can learn more from each other and grow more in the future.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/strength.png\r\n [2]: http://dailymtg.com\r\n [3]: http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/?-\r\n [4]: http://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mana-action-2011-05-23\r\n [5]: http://us.battle.net/hearthstone/en/forum/topic/19288409377\r\n [6]: http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=130701\r\n [7]: http://gatherer.wizards.com/Pages/Card/Details.aspx?multiverseid=233069\r",

That's where we are right now with all these&nbsp;Filipinos supporting Marcos. (Why yes, I did open a blog post immediately with Godwin's Law, thankyouverymuch)\r\n\r\nI have nothing personally against Bongbong Marcos, and I make no judgments on his personal track record and qualifications as a public servant. My main issue with him is that he is promoting historical revisionism of the sort that holocaust deniers are proud of. By insisting that his father was a great President and that Martial Law was actually good for the country is to demand that we unlearn the lessons of the past.&nbsp;Sure, the Aquinos and&nbsp;the succeeding administrations weren't exactly the best either and had their faults too, but that's beside the point. The&nbsp;crimes and excesses of the Marcos regime are well-documented and even international bodies have rendered verdicts against them. To deny these truths is to fool ourselves.\r\n\r\nI do believe that at some point we need to move on from this issue. But I believe that in order to move on, there is one thing needed most of all: the truth. A friend recently asked:&nbsp;if Bongbong apologizes for his father's sins and for Martial Law, would I accept that apology and move on? My answer, verbatim: \"For me it's acknowledging the sins of the father, returning the money, and telling all about the crimes of the marcos regime, including what they know about the forced disappearances and torture, the staged ambush that started martial law, the crony deals, the assassination of Ninoy, the cheating during the snap elections, etc.\"\r\n\r\nAs I write this, I believe the Vice Presidential election results are too close to call.&nbsp;But regardless of whether BBM wins or not, the very fact that at least 13 million voters chose to accept his brand of historical revisionism should be a source of national shame.",

It's not a particularly interesting story, but I still thought I'd record it here for posterity.\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Sometime when I was much younger, maybe somewhere between twelve to fourteen years old, I remember having some sort of QBasic programming learning book at home. I forget how we got it, I think my uncle brought it home for me sometime for some reason. I don’t know why he would have such a thing, we didn’t even have a personal computer at home (we had a Nintendo Entertainment System, but that wasn’t really the same thing)/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"In spite of that, I took to the book easily. In fact, I kind of devoured it with a passion. Not that it had a lot of information. It was maybe 20-30 pages long, and I remember the font being a bit too large so I guess it was really meant for a younger audience. (It was the early 90s though, what kids learned QBasic in those days? Very few families even had computers in the Philippines then) /span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"It was extremely basic (pun intended), with pages dedicated to line numbers and print statements and if statements. I remember that most of the control flow discussion centered around the use of GOTO which I would later learn was very bad. But I was fascinated with the idea of programmable machines. That you could give this machine a set of instructions and it would do what you asked. For the first time, I had a glimpse of the mechanisms behind those video games I loved to play. I read that book cover to cover again and again. It seemed like the possibilities were endless. My imagination was set afire./span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Some time later, and for some reason I don’t remember anymore, my parents signed up me and my younger brother for some sort of computer usage basics class at the nearby mall. I think it was like 2 weeks of daily classes during one summer. The guy taught us stuff like how to use the command line (Windows wasn’t really a thing yet at that time). It’s kind of silly, but I don’t really know what else we were taught. The main thing I remember from those sessions was that my brother and I figured out how to render \"art\" to the screen by printing out extended ASCII characters using batch files. Whatever it was the guy was teaching us, we quickly devoured and went through, which gave us a lot of extra time. We used that time to simulate video game screens using the extended ascii characters. I remember we made something that looked like a Nintendo game title screen, with options to choose \"1 PLAYER\" or \"2 PLAYER\". Of course, we didn’t really get anywhere./span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Fast forward a bit more. I was in fourth-year high school when I had my first computer programming class. We had a new computer lab on the top floor of the school, where we learned the basics of using Turbo Pascal. By this time, we already had a personal computer at home, a 386 (slightly dated) whose main use at that time was playing games like /spanspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Sid Meier’s Civilization, Romance of the Three Kingdoms,/spanspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\".and /spanspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Day of the Tentacle/spanspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\". I remember installing a copy of Turbo Pascal and teaching my brother how to use it. We may have had a book as reference, I’m not sure. (I assume we had a textbook for the class at school)/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Not soon after, he had already written some simple programs simulating the \"Choose Your Own Adventure\" type of stories, what we would later know to be called Text Adventures. I remember his first \"game\" being something about a kid visiting a haunted mansion. Of course, it was mostly unfinished and you would not be able to get more than a few decisions in. I remember taking a look at his code and it was a complicated mess of print statements and conditionals and hardcoded decision checks. We had no concept of how to write good code then, although I do remember telling him that it wasn’t a good idea to have variables named like \"v\", \"vv\", \"vvv\", \"vvvv\", etc./span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Jump ahead again a few years. I’m doing my thesis, soon to graduate as an Electronics and Communications Engineer. I had thought about taking up Computer Science, but in my youthful arrogance I felt like I already had a pretty good idea of programming and would find the actual course boring, based on my previous experiences. Despite that I had spent some time during the intervening years reading programming books and game development books I found in the Engineering library, and doing quite well in the data structures and algorithms class I had to take. For our thesis, we had to do a hardware part and a software part, and my thesismate easily agreed to let me do the software part; he knew how twitchy my hands were when working with hardware./span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Somehow, we managed to actually finish the thesis and graduate (quite delayed I might add), and I took a year off to \"study for the board exam.\" During that time, I sent out various job applications. I wasn’t yet sure where I would end up working, A few weeks after passing the board exams, I received a call from a software company based in Ortigas. They had received my application and asked me to come in for an exam. Um ok. I didn’t even remember sending an application in, I think it was one of many I sent out using Jobstreet. They were the only software company who contacted me. I believe at that time I was considering applying for a job at a small electronics company of the north side of the metro, closer to home (other opportunities for ECE graduates were more on the south side). I had no idea then what the local software industry looked like or whether it paid well or whatever, but I decided to try it out anyway. I ended up working at that company for more than ten years./span",

The game is created by Paradox, well-known for a number of other grand strategy games mostly with a historical basis such as Crusader Kings. I've owned Crusader Kings II for a while now but never got into it too deeply because (a) it's just a bit too overwhelming; and (b) I find the combat way too obtruse. Stellaris was supposedly a simpler and friendlier version of Paradox's other grand strategy games, which piqued my interest. Reading a few posts over on r/Stellaris was enough for me to impulse buy the game last week. Review summary: game is great and adds a lot of interesting stuff to the 4x genre, but there are some flaws that will hopefully be improved upon in succeeding patches.\r\n\r\nThe gameplay framework is basically similar to other 4x space strategy games such as Master of Orion: \"eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, and eXterminate\". You're in charge of a burgeoning galactic empire. You send out science ships to survey nearby and distant star systems. You build colonies and outposts to extend your reach. You assign scientists to research new technologies that help you improve your empire. You encounter other starfaring alien races and either build fleets of spacecraft to bludgeon them into submission or use diplomacy to make friends, form alliances and eventually a federation. You can also encounter primitive alien species who have yet to make it off-world and choose to either observe them passively or try to speed up their development or uplift them to become new allies.\r\n\r\nStory\r\n\r\nI'll start with this because it's my favorite thing about the game. It's kind of weird to be talking about story in a 4x strategy game, they're not really well-known for that, Civilization stories about Gandhi's warmongering aside. It's one of the trope inversions Stellaris has done. There are abundant special event chains to be encountered and some of them are hilarious really. These are reminiscent of Crusader Kings' own event chains, the part of that game I found the most enjoyable. Combined with 4x strategy games penchant for emergent user stories, this means there will often be a lot of stories to tell about how your empire achieved galactic domination.figure id=\"attachment_1193\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"wp-image-1193 size-medium\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/201605171552171-300x169.jpg\" alt=\"This is why you shouldn't let your officers drink on duty\" width=\"300\" height=\"169\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/201605171552171-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/201605171552171-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/201605171552171-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160517155217_1-500x281.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"This is why you shouldn't let your officers drink on duty/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\n*Victory *\r\n\r\nSadly there are at the moment only two victory conditions available in game: Domination (control 40% of all habitable planets) and Conquest (be the last independent empire standing). That being said, there are a few options to achieve both goals; they need not be achieved through warfare, but can be done through diplomacy. You can ally and eventually form federations with other empires and share victory conditions with them, which means you can achieve Conquest through alliance-building.\r\n\r\nDiplomacy\r\n\r\nSpeaking of diplomacy, you can do the usual resource trading and asking for border access and offering alliances or non-aggression pacts and such. But comparing it to their other games like Crusader Kings it's admittedly quite shallow. Even some more complicated options that are available in simpler games like Civilization V are surprisingly unavailable. There is no way to bribe other empires for alliances or border access or maybe even declaring war on common enemies. I also wish there were special event chains or technology choices that involve diplomatic relations. Hopefully they can improve upon these things as they iterate with future patches.\r\n\r\nI don't know therefore aliens\r\n\r\nThere are a variety of alien races available to play, and you can customize your species at the start of the game. There are a number of customization options: you can control what type of climates your species can easily adapt to, what ethics your race follows (which can affect your diplomacy and sometimes your research options), and add other special traits that give bonuses to happiness, resource acquisition, etc. All other empires in the galaxy will feature procedurally-generated species as well. At the start, each empire is only inhabited by one species, but as you encounter more and more alien races, your planet populations can become more a mix of your native species and foreign species and maybe even robot workers.\r\n\r\nResearch and Technology\r\n\r\nResearch and technology is split into three fields: physics, engineering and biology. These technologies will unlock new ship components (allowing you to design new ships Master of Orion style), improve your empire's capabilities and provide new building and station options. Unlike Civilization's technology trees, research options are dealt at random. You are given 3-4 alternatives to choose from every time, and sometimes you'll be lucky enough to have a rare technology as a research option. In the late game, there are even dangerous technologies that provide significant benefit but can lead to your empire facing one of a few late-game crises.\r\n\r\nMid to Late Game\r\n\r\nWhile the game is fun to play, it starts to get weak in the mid to late game when most of your exploration is already done. More often than not, other empires will hamper your mid to late game exploration, and your science ships will have precious little to do in the later stages except maybe analyze debris from your space battles. The game also needs more special event chains in the mid to late game as it descends into long stretches of building things interspersed by the occasional war. It's something they've roadmapped for the next few patches, to add more events specifically for colony-related events, so that's something to look forward to.\r\n\r\nThere's also a need for more resource sinks in the late game, as your empire has caps on how many of each resource you can store. In my most advanced game, I was at the resource cap all the time despite spending as much as I could on buildings, stations and spacecraft.\r\n\r\nBut the biggest problem is a technical one. As the number of planets and spacecraft under your control increases, the game encounters noticeable slowdown. At this point, the fastest speed is only slightly faster than the normal speed near the start of the game.\r\n\r\nI've owned the game for a bit less than a week and have managed to bring three different saves to the mid to late game but finished none of them. You are able to delegate most of your planets to AI sectors (in fact you have no choice as there is a limit to the number of core planets you can directly manage), but empire-building and expansion can still become tedious in the late game given the normal size of the generated galaxies.\r\n\r\nBugs\r\n\r\nI also encountered a few bugs as I played. Nothing game-breaking or crash to desktop stuff, but things like quests becoming impossible to complete under certain conditions, or supposedly stone-age species owning starships, that kind of thing. Steam achievements also seem a bit buggy, I think they stopped firing after a certain point in the game. They're planning a number of bug fixes within the next couple of months so hopefully most of these problems get addressed.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\nThere's a lot more to touch on as I'm pretty sure I've only scratched the surface of Stellaris, but this review is already way longer than I thought it would be. Stellaris is a fun, great game, providing a few good twists on the 4x genre, and very much like the Civilization games, there's a strong tendency to play for much longer hours than you were planning to.\r\n\r\nBut there are still some flaws especially in the mid to late game. Paradox has a good track record of improving their games incrementally with free updates (I recently reinstalled Crusader Kings II after a couple of years and was happy to find a few features that weren't there before), so hopefully many of these problems get ironed out in the next few months. I've already played way too much of this game than I expected, so I think I'm going to set it aside for a few months and come back to it later.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/20160514022357_1.jpg\r\n [2]: http://reddit.com/r/Stellaris\r",

It is not appropriate to say that a person or an entity \"is bias\". Unless you are talking to like a prejudice elemental or something (takes note of that for hypothetical hipster RPG)\r\n\r\nIn a (long-winded) discussion during the recent election period, someone told me that I \"obviously had a bias\" and my answer was \"Of course I do! Everyone does!\" People have different histories and backgrounds which means for any given topic they are likely to start from different points. These biases are perfectly okay and healthy and they're called opinions. (Cue quote about opinions being like assholes). Example: I'm not in favor of the death penalty therefore I'm biased against candidates that want to promote it\r\n\r\nAlthough we are all entitled to our own opinions, many times we are called upon to make objective judgments. Common examples are jury trials, elections, or when you're a judge in some contest. During these instances we have to be careful to weigh our own biases and opinions objectively to make sure we are giving a fair judgment\r\n\r\nWhat you do need to note is when you become subject to cognitive biases -- unconscious, automatic influences on human judgment and decision making that reliably produce reasoning errors. Be wary of your own cognitive biases and try to mitigate or compensate for them in your reasoning\r\n\r\nResearch has also shown that people have a bias blind spot. This means we think we are less biased than other people. This is why it is important to examine your own arguments from time to time to see whether you are subject to any of the known cognitive biases. When there is a need to be objective, we need to be extra critical of our own arguments\r\n\r\nOften, it is simply a matter of shifting your perspective: think about how a situation looks to people with an opposing point of view to balance out your own views. A sure sign of bias is that you are only aware of the positives of your own point of view and the negatives in others'\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"550\" data-dnt=\"true\"\r\n  p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"\r\n    Common Evidence of Bias: Your candidate is the best, and you can find absolutely nothing good to say about other candidates.\r\n  /p&mdash; Neil deGrasse Tyson (@neiltyson) \r\n  \r\n  a href=\"https://twitter.com/neiltyson/status/741361923061653504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"June 10, 2016/a\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 766531070116278272 }}\r\n\r\nAnother tip: *Do not listen only to people who have the same opinion as you do. *If you only expose yourself to people who think along the same lines, you are enabling the same set of biases until they become subconscious. This traps you in an echo chamber of people constantly reinforcing the same ideas. A friend and I recently were discussing how certain people react poorly to differing opinions and theorized that maybe that person grew up surrounded by people who enabled his biases\r\n\r\nInstead,* seek out different opinions. *Continuing from the death penalty example above, I don't shut out discussion from friends who I know to be pro-death penalty. I still read their threads and try to understand their point of view. Listening to a wide variety of different opinions will tend to cancel out your biases with time and will lead towards more objective thinking. For example, when conducting a performance assessment of a team member (something I've done often for the past decade or so!), I tend to get other people's opinions first to contrast with my own, and will often ask someone else whether I might be biased in certain situations. The risk of personal bias is mitigated by sourcing different opinions\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, we probably can't completely eliminate our own biases, but that doesn't mean we stop trying to be more objective in our thoughts and discussions and decisions\r\n\r\n [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_bias\r",

It made think of a time when we were kids and we tried running a business\r\n\r\nIt was a summer from years ago. Perhaps 1988 or 1989, or maybe a year or two earlier, I can't be sure. I was young, my brother was younger by a few years, my female cousin older by a few years. Back then our families live under the same roof, my grandfather's house\r\n\r\nWe needed something to keep us occupied during the summer. We probably already had a Nintendo around this time, but my brother and I were only allowed one hour of video games a day, so we needed something else to fill the time. I think it was my mother who suggested we run a small business over the summer, sell some food things to people\r\n\r\nOur house had a sari-sari store. Sari-sari stores are like small family-owned convenience stores in the Philippines, often run out of the house directly, with the storefront little more than holes in the wall that make up the house's facade. The one in our house had one small window and one large window, each covered by rusty metal bars half a foot apart. It sold soft drinks (cokes and sprites and whatnot), beer to the local tambays, small bags of chips (Chippy, Clover Chips, Tortillos, etc), small chocolates and packs of nuts and such. As kids we spent a lot of free time at the store, especially when the parents were away. After my grandfather died, the store was taken over by a beloved family friend who had been living with us forever. She often indulged us kids our whimsies, which often meant our parents came home to find out they now owed a bunch more pesos to the store. That summer, we had decided to sell ice candy to the people in the neighborhood through the store\r\n\r\nYou could be forgiven for not knowing what ice candy was, at least if you didn't live in the Philippines. It's a treat made out of frozen flavored water, usually in a long plastic bag that gives it an elongated shape. In the US, they might be called \"freeze pops\"\r\n\r\nMy parents gave us some \"seed money\" (and I suppose my uncle gave my cousin some as well). I think my brother and I would have a separate stock from our cousin, but we would both be selling in the same store. We went to the nearby grocery store and bought the materials we'd need: some powdered flavoring and packs of small plastic tubes. When we got home, our mother showed us how to prepare the ice candy. We would mix the flavoring (I think we used orange flavoring. I liked orange back then) in some water, then pour the flavored water into the plastic tubes and tie a knot in the end to seal them. Then we would leave the tubes in the freezer overnight, and we would sell them the next day\r\n\r\nI remember them being a hit, especially with the neighborhood kids. We sold them for I think a peso each, or maybe a peso and fifty centavos. (Things were simple and cheap back then.) I think my cousin used slightly larger plastic tubes and sold her ice candies for a bit more. In theory, we would then reinvest the day's income into more flavoring and plastic tubes for the next day, but I think it turned out that our parents just gave us more money for the next day's materials. So perhaps it was less of capitalism and more of \"here's a fun way to earn allowance during the summer\"\r\n\r\nI specifically remember my younger brother enjoying the business and dreaming of making it big as a businessman. His imagined future business was still ice candy. He imagined having an ice candy empire well-known throughout the land, with rich and famous personalities such as the president coming to his stores to buy ice candy. So maybe the exercise did manage to impart a little bit of entrepreneurial spirit to us after all\r\n\r\nI remember at the end of that summer, we were happy with the amount of money we had earned, and we talked about doing it again the next summer. But we never did",

Immortality! Take it! It's yours!\" -- Achilles, Troy\r\n\r\nEach person has a different view of what their life's purpose is, but I've found more often than not it relates to some form of immortality. Usually that means leaving something behind, some trace of yourself so that the world remembers you, something that says \"I was here, I existed.\" For many people that means offspring, for others it may mean some other legacy: children taught, people helped, ideas expounded, inventions created, companies founded, and so on\r\n\r\nFor me, I wouldn't mind actual immortality. Who knows, it may still happen in our lifetime. Medical science may yet find a way to extend our lifespans or even permanently remove aging (at which point we really need to expand beyond this planet). Or maybe we manage to survive until the singularity and live on as artificial constructs\r\n\r\nLiterature and popular culture often portray immortality as some sort of curse. Sometimes a literal curse, as in vampires or highlanders needing to cut each other's heads off. More often the implied of curse of eternal solitude -- Superman is often taunted by writers with the idea that everyone he loves will eventually grow old and die, and other immortals are often portrayed as not wanting to burden themselves with short-lived human connections\r\n\r\nWhat interests me the most about the idea of immortality is the idea that we as a species have so much to look forward to. (Assuming we manage to bypass The Great Filter and avoid screwing things up for ourselves of course.) Even just the coming decades hold a lot of promise, with advances in space exploration, artificial intelligence, autonomous vehicles, and so on that may very well expand the horizons of the human experience. And who knows, immortality may actually help George R.R. Martin finish the Song of Ice and Fire series!\r\n\r\nI want to be immortal if only to be able to see where we are going and what comes next. The future, it comes. Perhaps sooner than many of us expect\r\n\r",

The most dangerous of this data is the user's password since it may allow access not only to your own service but to other services as well. As an application developer, the below is probably the bare minimum you need to know when handling user passwords:\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nNever store passwords in plain text! This is the most important rule. It means that if your database is ever compromised, the password information will not be exposed\r\n\r\nThis is true even if your application doesn't contain sensitive data or would not otherwise cause any problems if compromised. This is because many users will tend to re-use the same password across different services (although they really shouldn't!)\r\n\r\nUse a strong one-way cryptographic hash function to store the passwords. One-way hashes can still be brute-forced, but the idea is that the computational effort to do so will be so large to make it not worth the effort. The most commonly used/recommended algorithms are bcrypt and PBKDF2. One of these should suffice, but take note to check every few years or so if better cryptographic hash algorithms emerge; as technology and hardware evolves and computational power increases, at some point in the future stronger algorithms may be needed (it might take a while though, bcrypt has been good since 1999)\r\n\r\nCryptographic hash functions are designed to be collision-resistant, meaning the result of the hash function will almost certainly be unique. When the user submits a password for authentication, you simply hash it using the same method and compare the hash against the one stored in the database\r\n\r\n*Use a unique salt per password before hashing. *Salting means that you don't hash the password by itself, you instead combine it with another string before hashing. Not only does this increase the length and complexity of the hashed string, but reduces vulnerability to so-called dictionary attacks and rainbow table attacks. The salt should be different for each user, probably some combination of personal data like the username and a key like the user id stored in your system\r\n\r\n*Never send passwords in plain text either. *You may be tempted to send out an email with the password in plain text on a password reset request. The common practice now is to just generate and send a unique user-specific link to allow the user to set his own password manually\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nForce good password practices on your users. This means requiring sufficiently strong passwords. Many modern services provide quick feedback on how strong the input password is. Optionally you can also require that the password contains a varied amount of lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, and other special characters, but this is not really necessary if the passwords are of sufficient length. Also consider requiring users to change their passwords after a set period\r\n\r\nYou should disallow the most common passwords. A list of the most commonly used passwords (such as \"password\" and \"123456\") are available from previously leaked password hacks. Microsoft has recently started to roll out this sort of check now in their services. Actually, one good idea I've heard of before is to have a uniqueness check on the password field -- disallow users from having the same password as any other user, but this may not be feasible depending on how you hash the passwords\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nIf your application has a large number of users or is especially critical (anything involving money transactions is a good candidate), you should also consider implementing some sort of two-factor authentication. Most common implementations these days use email, SMS or a mobile application as the second factor\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nThese practices won't prevent your application from being hacked. In truth, probably nothing can really prevent hacks 100% especially against determined hackers. These are simply mitigation practices you need to be aware of as the application developer to protect your users in case your application does get hacked. Other methods of securing your system may be the responsibility of other roles such as system administrators/engineers or dev ops\r\n\r\n [1]: http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/4781/do-any-security-experts-recommend-bcrypt-for-password-storage/6415#6415\r\n [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dictionary_attack\r\n [3]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_table\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by joaquin on 2016-06-16 09:49:28 +0000\r\nSome applications hash the passwords multiple times along with a unique salt to make brute-force attacks much harder. However this still won't prevent it, especially since computing power seems to always be on the bad guys' side.\r\n\r\nAnother technique would be to store the salts and/or the number of hash iterations outside the DB where the passwords are stored. This way, even if the DB is compromised, hackers will still be lacking vital info to crack the passwords.",

If even the founder of the world's largest social network can be hacked, anybody can! So it might be a good idea to review how you manage and secure your online passwords\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n*Avoid using short, simple, or commonly-used passwords! *These are subject to so-called \"brute force\" attacks where bad actors just try a whole lot of passwords until they find one that works. You don't actually have to use numbers or special characters (unless the service requires you to do so). What can really hamper password attackers is password length, the longer the better, since the length of the password increases the computational time needed for a brute-force attack. For the most important services, I would suggest a password length of at least 20 characters (although some services won't allow you to have passwords this long, which deserves a glare from me). If not required to use numbers or special characters, you can simply use a pass phrase composed of multiple English words. This has the pleasant side effect of being easy to remember. As with many things, this is best illustrated by XKCD:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignnone\" src=\"http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png\" width=\"740\" height=\"601\" /\r\n\r\nTake note that it's important to choose passwords or phrases that are not related to common personal information such as birthdays, names of relatives, or anniversaries. This is all information which any attacker might be able to acquire from other sources. This is how Michael Caine's character in Now You See Me got hacked by the Four Horsemen!\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nAvoid using the same passwords for every service! This is one of the cardinal rules that Zuck broke causing the hack. A few years back, data from LinkedIn was accessed by hackers including passwords, and the hackers were able to use Zuck's LinkedIn password to log in to his Twitter and Pinterest accounts\r\n\r\nYou probably don't have to use unique passwords for _every _service -- I have a few \"low-security\" passwords that I use whenever I don't care about the account being compromised. Most common usage for me is when I need to ask a question on some programming forum (for the rare case that StackOverflow does not suffice)\r\n\r\nYou need to identify which services are critical to you -- the ones you can't afford to have compromised. Typically (for me at least), this includes financial services (online banking websites), email and social media accounts you use on a regular basis, and probably government services (I don't have any of those at the moment). For these services you should use different passwords for each one, to protect the other accounts in case one of them gets compromised\r\n\r\nIn the past few years many major services such as LinkedIn have had their password data exposed (If the programmers were doing their job right, the hackers wouldn't have been able to decrypt the password data even if they accessed it -- but that's material for another post), so if you're using a lot of online service, the odds of some of your data getting hacked at some point is quite high\r\n\r\nThe problem is: most people have trouble remembering one password, how can they be expected to remember multiple passwords and match them to the corresponding service? There are a few of strategies:\r\n\r\n  *Use a password manager program *such as LastPass. These programs will randomly generate and store a new password for you for each service you use. A lot of commenters online swear by this, but I'm not a fan of it because (a) I need my passwords everywhere, anywhere, any time. LastPass has an option to sync passwords across the cloud, but it requires a premium account; (b) additional steps when you need to create or store or remember a password; (c) if you lose access to the password manager, you also lose everything else\r\n  Use a procedurally-generated password for each service. This is my preferred option. It means that for each service, you construct a password using a fixed set of rules, with the rules taking into account the service itself. A simple example would be using a base password + the service name: with a base password of \"horseradish\", you would use \"horseradishYahoo\" for Yahoo mail and \"horseradishFacebook\" for Facebook and so on. Of course, if your Yahoo mail account is compromised the hacker can still easily guess your Facebook password, so it needs to be more complicated than that. A better example would be: base password + your favorite Transformer whose name starts with the third letter of the service: for Yahoo it would be \"horseradishHound\" and for Facebook it would be \"horseradishCliffjumper\"\r\n  Keep a list of password hints written down. Either on paper or on a softcopy document somewhere you can access all the time. Now obviously, if you keep a list of the passwords themselves you risk someone finding that list and accessing all your services. What I like to do is maintain a list of cryptic password hints that really only make sense to me\r\n  *Memorize them! *For the most important accounts (probably the ones that allow access to other services via forgot password mechanisms), you should generate a unique password and eventually memorize them\r\n\r\nI use some combination of #2 and #3: for most social media services I use #2 but for more critical services like online banking I use some variation of the procedural rules and maintain a list of cryptic hints that describe how I varied the rules. #2 works fine for social media accounts since I can reconstruct the passwords mentally wherever I am without need to reference a list. For online banking services, I don't use them that often but they need to be more secure so it's okay for me to have to reference a list if I forget the passwords. For my primary email accounts, I have a very strong password that I have committed to memory with no hints anywhere\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nSome random other tips:\r\n\r\n  *Change your passwords on a regular basis. *Regularly changing passwords means older passwords can't be used against you in case they are hacked. It can be as simple as changing your password when you log into a service for the first time in a new year\r\n  Don't share passwords with anybody! Well okay, maybe you can share some passwords with select family members as necessary. But basically don't give your passwords to anyone you wouldn't confess murder to. There are still scammers who pretend to be authorities in order to collect passwords and other information from you. Be wary of strangers!\r\n  Don't use any browser feature that remembers the passwords for you. I suggest typing out your passwords every time. Typing them out makes it easier for your brain to remember your passwords. But more importantly, if your machine is compromised by malware, your passwords can be accessed from the browser's data store\r\n  Not really password-related but you should take note anyway: Use two-factor authentication whenever it is available. This is where whenever you login to a service, it will also send you a secret code via another channel such as SMS or email. You then need to input that secret code in the service in order to proceed. This is so that even if your password is compromised, hackers still can't access your account. This is starting to become more and more common among the widely used services: Google, Facebook, Twitter, and Steam all provide 2FA. Modern online banking services will even require you to use two-factor authentication. (Sadly not all local banks do so)\r\n\r\n* *\r\n\r\nWell, that post turned out longer than I expected! It might seem like overkill to have overly complicated passwords or password management schemes. If you use any online services which contain important data you can't afford to have compromised, it's a necessary evil and well worth the effort\r\n\r\n [1]: http://uk.businessinsider.com/mark-zuckerberg-twitter-pinterest-accounts-hacked-linkedin-hack-facebook-passwords-2016-6\r\n [2]: http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/password_strength.png\r\n [3]: http://stackoverflow.com/\r\n [4]: https://lastpass.com/\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by joaquin on 2016-06-14 11:32:45 +0000\r\nPasswdSafe is another password vault that you can use. It keeps a local db file of your passwords unlike other services that require you to store it in their server. It's free to use so that's another plus for me.\r\n\r\nWhat I do is sync the db file to my dropbox so I can access it anywhere.\r\n\r\nComment by Jaime on 2016-06-14 14:35:57 +0000\r\nThe problem with 2 comes from required password formats (which ultimately give a framework for hackers to brute-force attack).\r\n\r\nSome (ancient) websites put a character limit on passwords, which make it difficult to get fancy. Some (modern) websites require that you put a number, punctuation, etc. and that there must be capital letters integrated into your system. If your original password does not have accommodations for these rules, you're going to have to change algorithms.\r\n\r\nThere was also that time when Gawker websites had problems with passwords containing unicode characters. Better make sure that your passwords use the same standard characters.\r\n\r\n&#8212; \r\n\r\nOne way to fight against difficult-to-remember passwords (such as tr0ubadour&3) that don't use standard English words is to use Latinized words from a different language! This works especially well if you're multi-lingual. They defend better against a dictionary-biased brute-force attack than using standard word concatenation without the memorization penalty.",

Now, I'm of the opinion that for a personal blog such as this, web performance isn't really a mission-critical sort of thing, but as a software developer who has often had to work hard to optimize the web applications we delivered to our clients, it kind of became a matter of pride :pfigure id=\"attachment_1300\" style=\"width: 473px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1300\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/report.png\" alt=\"Unacceptable!\" width=\"473\" height=\"173\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/report.png 473w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/report-300x110.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Unacceptable!/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nI also ran the site through Google PageSpeed Insights. The results were mostly the same, but the Google site gave me results faster, so this was the one I referenced for subsequent testing. The most important problems to address were:\r\n\r\n  Optimizing image sizes\r\n  Removing render-blocking JS and CSS in above-the fold content\r\n  Leverage browser caching (through the use of HTTP headers)\r\n  Minify CSS and Javascript\r\n\r\nAll of these are familiar to me since they are very common performance optimizations done in web applications. However, this blog is running on WordPress, which means I should try to look for existing WordPress-based solutions instead of hacking the code myself. (I used to run a custom-built Django-based blog system here, but I got tired of maintaining it myself so I went for tried-and-true WordPress). Here are the optimizations I ended up doing:\r\n\r\n  Upgraded to the default WordPress Twenty-Sixteen Theme. Not strictly necessary for optimization, but I was previously using the Twenty-Twelve Theme, and the problem with using older themes is that they may not be using newer web development techniques to improve performance. Also, Twenty-Sixteen looked better haha. And yes, I do use the default WordPress themes. Too lazy (as of yet) to look for a nice custom theme, and I don't have the design chops myself to build it, so it will do for now.\r\n  For the image size problem, I found that the biggest offender was the Sketching Daily post where I broke down how I do my daily sketches. The problem was that I was uploading full-size images of the drawings and they were being inlined into the post -- which meant the browser was loading the full-size image even though it was shown in a smaller size on the post itself. Instead, I manually changed the settings of each image in the post to use one of the smaller-size images generated by WordPress on upload. img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1302\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wp-image-settings.png\" alt=\"wp-image-settings\" width=\"612\" height=\"388\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wp-image-settings.png 612w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wp-image-settings-300x190.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px\" /Choosing \"Large\" here meant the Large one would be inlined, while I could still set the image to link to the full-size one on click. The full size image is a whole fifteen times larger than the \"large\" image! It's something I need to remember in the future if I ever upload huge images again. I also found a link that described how to set the default image size (so that it doesn't default to full size all the time), but I don't think it's necessary for now.\r\n  To further help with image optimization, I installed the WP Smush plugin, which automatically optimizes (\"smushes\") uploaded images. I found that WP Smush reduces the uploaded image sizes by around 10-15% on average, it's not too bad.\r\n  Next was render-blocking JavaScript. If you're not familiar, any script include=\"... \" / tag in your HTML blocks the rendering of any content below the tag itself until the content of the JS has finished executing. The typical solutions are either to (a) move the script tags to below the content (\"below the fold\") or (b) add an \"async\" or \"defer\" attribute to the script tag. It turns out that there was already a plugin that did (b), Async Javascript. So I gave it a go, but for some reason it wasn't working. After a bit of debugging, I found that there was an \"aj_enabled\" option that wasn't being set. I couldn't figure out any settings page to update it, so I went ahead and edited the plugin directly to set the value: img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1303\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wp-async-js.png\" alt=\"wp-async-js\" width=\"1008\" height=\"555\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wp-async-js.png 1008w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wp-async-js-300x165.png 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wp-async-js-768x423.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1008px) 100vw, 1008px\" /It's generally a bad idea to hack the local copy of your WordPress plugins, since you have to check the impact every time the plugin has a new version, but I decided to live with it for now. After the update, sure enough the JS no longer blocked page rendering.\r\n  Lastly, I installed the W3 Total Cache plugin. I disabled the WP Super Cache plugin I was using before since they would probably have some sort of conflict. In addition to page caching, this plugin addresses a couple of other issues: it supports HTML/JS/CSS minification (reduces file sizes and HTTP requests) and it allows adding the expiry headers to static content (to leverage browser caching). If you've done any work on website performance, the settings for the plugin are straightforward to understand, but I also referenced the guide at this link. The plugin looks okay, but there's an unfortunate side effect: the minified JS created by the plugin does not respect Async Javascript, so it blocks above the fold content from rendering. It's a problem I'll have to try to resolve in the future.\r\n\r\nAfter the above changes, I retest the site:figure id=\"attachment_1305\" style=\"width: 717px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1305\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wp-report.png\" alt=\"Much improvement!\" width=\"717\" height=\"297\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wp-report.png 717w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wp-report-300x124.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 717px) 100vw, 717px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Much improvement!/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nMuch improvement indeed! There's still a few issues to iron out, but for the most part I'm happy with the results (and my pride has been satisfied :p). I may revisit this issue at a future date to see if there's anything else I can improve on.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: https://testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/report.png\r\n [3]: https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights\r\n [4]: http://roytang.net/2016/03/sketching-daily/\r\n [5]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wp-image-settings.png\r\n [6]: https://made4wp.com/changing-default-attachment-display-setting-insert-image-post/\r\n [7]: https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-smushit/\r\n [8]: https://wordpress.org/plugins/async-javascript/\r\n [9]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wp-async-js.png\r\n [10]: https://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/\r\n [11]: https://gtmetrix.com/wordpress-optimization-guide.html\r",

Evaluating someone's programming ability is hard, especially someone fresh out of college. A student's grades is in no way indicative of how well he can program after all. So most nontrivial programming jobs have some sort of complicated application process involved.\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"I remember going in and taking an exam. Most application processes will have some sort of written exam to filter out people who look good on paper, but can’t actually do anything. People graduate college all the time without being able to do anything so it’s a fairly good idea/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"I was expecting the written exam to be programming questions, but to my surprise it wasn’t. The questions were puzzle/problem solving type questions. I think there were 10 questions in all. I don’t remember all of them, but for sure one of them was the pirates puzzle described here: /spanspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"http://www.mathsisfun.com/puzzles/5-pirates-solution.html/spanspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\". I never did find out how many I got correct, although I felt pretty good about my answers for all of them/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"After passing the written exam, I also had to take a second technical exam. It consisted of a few parts, the first part was they gave me some sort of string-manipulation problem and I had to write a program emon a whiteboard/em and explain and defend it. Nowadays if you asked someone to write a program on paper or on a whiteboard during an interview, it would kind of look ridiculous since it doesn’t reflect a realistic scenario of how programmers work these days (i.e. with the internet and IDEs and autocompletes and whatnot), but that was how things were done back in the day/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"I hadn’t done much programming outside of using C, so that’s the language I used to provide my solution, but in theory I could have just used some sort of pseudocode since they don’t require you to use specific languages. As a programmer applying for a job, I would recommend prioritizing opportunities that don’t require you to know a specific language or set of languages. You’ll learn and grow a lot more as a programmer/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"After leaving me in the room for thirty minutes, the interviewer came back and I had to explain the program I had written on the whiteboard. It was a typical string-manipulation problem designed to see how well coders think through the process. I don’t remember the details too much, but I remember getting into a debate with the interviewer about the expected behavior for the C function strcpy(). I didn’t want to appear too argumentative, so even though I believed I was right (and I confirmed it afterwards!) I just let it be after insisting a couple of times/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"After the programming question, I got asked an \"impossible question\". This is another type of interview question that has mostly fallen out of favor these days. The idea of an impossible question is basically the interviewee tries to approximate an answer to a question that would generally take a lot of research to answer. The interviewee has to explain his reasoning of how he would estimate the answer, and from there the interviewer can make a judgment of how well thought out the interviewee’s processes are. I didn’t know about this style of question ahead of time of course, this interview was the first time I’ve encountered it. I actually still remember the impossible question asked of me: I was asked how many people ride the Metrorail (MRT3) in Metro Manila on a daily basis. This was in 2002, so the MRT3 had only been out for around 3 years and wasn’t quite as congested as it was now, so I could make some reasonable assumptions like each train arrives at each station every 5 minutes, each car usually houses 300 people on average, etc, and I think I gave a pretty reasonable answer/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"This style of recruitment process was popular at the time, more than ten years ago. Companies like Microsoft were well-known for it. In fact many potential programming job applicants would be advised on internet forums to google \"Microsoft interview questions\", and many of them became so well-known MS was forced to revamp its processes as well/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"With the problem solving, the code walk-through and the impossible question, the focus was finding not necessarily people who were very good at coding per se, but rather people who exhibited a strong analytical approach to problem solving/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"These days the recruitment process is very, very different. In most, if not all companies, the written exam will focus on technical, coding questions. You’ll be given sample code and need to try to identify the problems with the code. A friend even had to answer questions over the phone about details of Java syntax (pretty useless questions if you ask me)/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"And instead of a technical interview where you have to write code manually, most likely you’ll be given a workstation with an IDE and computer access and asked to implement so-and-so program. Some of the more progressive ones will do a pairing exam where you have to do pair programming with one of their existing developers; such pairing exams give insight on two fronts: your technical skill and how well you can work well with someone already on the team you’re applying for/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"I kind of prefer the old style of recruitment processes because they give a better chance for people like me who had minimal formal programming education but can learn easily and quickly/span\r\n\r",

My first task involved porting reports which were to be generated by the users then printed out. The task wasn’t too difficult: basically you took the source code of the report (it was some weird binary format recognized only by the particular reporting tool -- that was how it was done back in the day) and open it using the newer version of the tool, and the tool did some sort of migration magic to adapt it to the new format, then you just save it back again. You compile and run the report using the new format and verify that it’s getting the correct output (needs to be the same output as the old format), and that should be it. Most of the time, at least. Sometimes there were some things that the new format couldn’t handle, or maybe there were some minor compile errors after migration, but such problems were easily fixed, so it was pretty straightforward/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Or so I thought. All the reports I was porting were being tested by one of my team members, who was also a newbie like me. Coincidentally, both of the testers I had on the project were also ECE graduates same as me; I was the unusual one who took the developer role. They had their own training focused on tester concepts, so initially I had no idea what to expect. When you’re fresh out of school you don’t have any idea yet how much iteration and rework goes into software development, so there’s this attitude of, \"Hey it’s working. Looks good!\" without being too thorough/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"I soon found out that the testers were trained to be very thorough, so I would get a bunch of bug reports. One of my testers would print out the reports, both the new format and the old format, and hold both reports up against the light, overlaid on each other. And they had to match, pixel-perfect! If the new report generated in a slightly different manner, that was a bug! (Of course, this made no sense to me, since logically the users wouldn’t care or notice if some column in the report was 1 pixel over to the right compared to the old format, but those were the instructions so whatever). And then they would use like really long nonsense strings in the data, and in some cases it would make the text wrapping in the report work differently, so I had to fix those too. Then one of the testers would print out reports with a lot of data, generating like 30 to 40 pages or more (we wasted a lot of paper in those days), and the pagination had to match exactly between the old format and the new format. And if it didn’t, I had to spend some time poring over the printout to find the exact point at which the pagination changed and what caused it. Eventually I learned a set of tricks and knew what to look out for when porting the reports/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"When you’re starting out as a software developer and you’re first introduced to the idea of QA or software testers, there’s a slight tendency to be offended or defensive about bug reports and to be a bit annoyed at the testers. After all, these are people whose job is specifically to find your errors! It’s a problem especially if you have a sense of pride about your work, but once you let go of that pride and recognize that you are not your code, you get to realize that you and the testers are working as a team. The testers are the shield that make sure that stupid stuff you missed or overlooked doesn’t get sent to the users. It’s like how in a buddy cop movie you need to have a partner to watch your back or to cover the other exit so that the bad guy doesn’t get away/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"After working with the same testers for some time you get used to their individual quirks and figure out which bugs they are more likely to find, so you start focusing on those areas more. You also learn some tricks to sometimes troll around with them especially when you get annoyed with too many bug reports/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"One of my favorite things early on in the same project was when I would send one of programs over for testing. In addition to the reports, often we would also be doing forms running using the same tool. In those days, we didn’t yet have Hudson or Maven or Ant any sort of automated build system. We would commit our source to version control and generate the binary file manually and copy the binary file over into a shared network drive. And there was no versioning on the network drive, just one folder where all the binaries were. Then we can tell the tester, hey you can test so-and-so program now/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"The tester would copy the binaries from the network drive to their own machines for testing, and after a while he would come back with some bug reports. The bug reports would be logged in an Excel file (we didn’t have any bug tracking software then either), and I would do a quick skim, and if the changes were easy enough (minor UI stuff), I’d do some quick edits, rebuild the binary, and copy it to the network drive. Then I would message the tester, pretending I’d just seen the bug reports, \"Hey, these bug reports don’t seem right. I think you forgot to get the latest files from the drive.\" And sure enough, they get the latest files and check again and the bugs would already be fixed. I managed to do this a couple of times before my tester caught on/span\r\n\r\nWith the advent of dedicated test servers and modern build scripts, of course this was something I couldn't regularly do anymore -- although once or twice I did have the opportunity to do a live edit on a test server (to verify my fix works) and troll the tester a bit by telling her it worked fine!\r\n\r\nAfter a few months of working with testers, you quickly get used to working with them and get into a good rhythm. You're kind of partners in crime, except instead of crime it's quality in software programs. Even with modern developer unit-testing and automated testing practices, having a second set of eyes looking at your program and attacking it from different angles helps improve the quality of the system. A good tester is the shield to the developer's sword, they make sure the developer keeps his guard up and doesn't lose to his own mistakes",

I think my response was good enough to quote verbatim:\r\n\r\n p class=\"qtext_para\"\r\n   Remember: You are not your code. You are not the hundred or so lines of C or Java or JavaScript or whatever that you wrote today.\r\n /p\r\n \r\n p class=\"qtext_para\"\r\n   This problem arises because you are too attached to your code. Your ego is associated with the code you write and you feel that any comments or defects found reflect upon   you as a person.\r\n /p\r\n \r\n p class=\"qtext_para\"\r\n   You are not perfect. You will not write perfect software, and that's fine. It's not a flaw, it's just the way software is. It isn't written all in one go, magically perfect and elegant and satisfying all the requirements. Good software goes through multiple iterations and many eyes looking at it.\r\n /p\r\n \r\n p class=\"qtext_para\"\r\n   It is also important to treat it as a learning experience -- learn what you can from each code review comment and try to apply what you learn to future code you write. This also helps you minimize review comments in the future. Instead of treating the large number of comments as a shortcoming on your part, treat it as a metric you can improve upon.\r\n /p\r\n\r\np class=\"qtext_para\"\r\n  It's probably true of any endeavor which results in creation -- be it programming, arts, crafts or whatnot -- that you need to be able to divorce yourself from your work so that you can accept and analyze and learn from criticisms objectively and without feeling terrible about yourself.\r\n/p\r\n\r\np class=\"qtext_para\"\r\n  Fun fact: All programmers write terrible code. Yes, even the veterans, the rock stars, the elite, they have all written terrible code at some point in their careers and they will probably write more terrible code in the future. The key is to recognize those instances -- either through introspection or being open to criticism -- and learning from them and trying to minimize them in the future. Or at least correct them earlier!\r\n/p\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Eric on 2016-06-02 15:18:42 +0000\r\nThis is very true. It also gets more difficult to write \"correct\"&#8216; code as you get older and gain more experience. The definition of \"correct\" is refined with experience and it becomes easy to get locked in analysis paralysis because you are much harder on yourself when reviewing your own code.\r\n\r\nThere is something to just sitting down and making something work as a newbie. The fact that something works provides motivation to continue...  So much so that this has become my new approach to mentoring junior developers. Think about the problem, refine the high level design with input from others, and then code something that works. It's easier to refactor a working system than it is to try to design the perfect implementation up front.\r\n\r\nComment by ExMicrosoftie on 2016-06-03 04:55:45 +0000\r\nOf course this is the wise approach to this situation -- but I've been in more than one workgroup where managers penalized you based on numbers of CR comments -- without ever reading any of them, of course. Ideally we'd all improve over time and get less feedback and the system would work -- and maybe outside of Redmond that's what the culture supports -- but when everyone reviewing your code is in direct competition with you for raises, people tend to ramp up the feedback to take their competitors/coworkers down. (In my decade of experience in MS Office, Developer Division, and Windows, anyway) In that case, it's more than just ego attachment fueling the frustration, it's your career viability, your family's medical insurance, maybe your work visa status. Sometimes there's nothing wrong with your code, and a workplace is just hostile. That's not a problem you solve through detachment.\r\n\r\n Comment by roy on 2016-06-03 08:10:55 +0000\r\nOf course not all workplaces are ideal, but I think even in those situations being overly attached to your code can hinder and not help. The idea is not that you don't defend your code but rather that you treat criticism with an open mind -- that doesn't mean you accept it if it's BS though! 🙂",

I felt that they were no guarantee of knowledge or expertise, and that many people who did have knowledge or expertise wouldn’t necessarily have a certification to say so. Add to that it often seem overpriced to even apply for the certifications, so I didn’t have a high opinion of them. That being said, I have had the opportunity to take professional certification exams twice in my life (both luckily paid for by my employer at that time)./span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"The first was the JITSE -- the Japanese IT Standards Examinations. This was back in 2004 when our company was planning to undertake some projects based in Japan. Luckily, the exam did not require us to learn Japanese. The exam mostly covered programming and computer science concepts. The scope was largely academic in nature, not really related to the actual practice of software development. At first I thought it might be a problem for me since I had no formal computer science schooling, but it turns out I need not have worried. We were able to find ample review materials / sample exams that gave us a good coverage of the scope of the exams. We even had like five thick textbooks full of review material to cover, which typically I didn’t end up going through (seemed like a bother), I felt like the sample exams were more than enough. And to add even further to my disdain of certification exams, a significant percentage of the questions during the actual certification were already in the sample exams we reviewed. So yes, easily passed./span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Of course I should probably note ever since high school I have considered myself to be a fiend when taking multiple-choice exams. I am supremely confident when taking any sort of multiple choice exam, no matter the actual level of knowledge I possess. During the JITSE for example, I finished it very early. If I didn’t have any kind of shame, I would have submitted the AM exam a whole hour-and-a-half early just so I could get some sleep before the PM part. (Some people later told me they noticed me dozing off). Multiple choice exams are really easy to go through quickly, especially if there’s minimal problems solving involved. There’s no reason to linger at each question: you either know the answer or you don’t, and if you don’t you quickly decide on a candidate that looks the most likely. (If there’s some sort of problem solving or math involved then you go into that weird fuzzy logic where you try to figure out which choice is mathematically closest to the answer you got. Or yes, you could just redo your work, but don’t be afraid to assume that the exam itself can be wrong if you come up with the same answer three times)/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"The second time I took a professional certification exam was when I was asked to take a Java 6 certification exam for reasons I now cannot remember. This one I was more confident in -- by this point I had already been using Java for emthe better part of a decade/em and was pretty sure I knew it inside and out. That being said, you always find out about obscure language quirks when preparing for these exams. For example, I never had to use the keyword volatile so I really only learned what it was for while reviewing for the certification exam. /span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Being the exam-taking fiend I was, I took and easily passed the Java 6 certification exam, which of course led to jokes along the lines of \"Hey, we don’t need a compiler anymore, Roy is now a valid JVM\". I never did get to use that certification for anything though. I took the exam and passed it (finally earning my Java certification) in Oct 2012, after 8 years of being a Java programmer./span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Over the years as I’ve dealt with a wider range of people across society, my disdain for certifications has dimmed a bit. The most important bit I have learned is that it’s very hard to evaluate software developers in terms of skill (a topic itself worthy of an entire series of blog posts), so certifications allow people in hiring capabilities (or any other capability that requires an assessment of a developer’s skill) to cheat a little bit. They save a little bit of effort because a certification basically says \"this guy knows his stuff well enough to pass a certification exam\", which can be good enough depending on your specific purposes. Sure, it’s possible to pass a certification exam and have no real idea how to apply the topics covered in practice, but at least the certification gives them a bit more confidence in you, even if unjustified. It’s a bit like school diplomas and driver’s licenses: it doesn’t really guarantee that you know what you’re doing, but at least you were good enough to fool other people who evaluated you, so even if you turn out to be not so good, at least the evaluator is not alone in making that mistake. /span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"And if you’re the sort of developer who’s all about the money, having certain certifications can be very good for your bank account. I’m pretty sure getting an in-demand certification like Oracle DBA or Cisco Networking stuff can get you a significant bump in pay grade. This also means that it can cost a significant amount of money to even apply for taking those certification exams -- it might be best to try to find a way to fool -- er, I mean persuade -- your current employer into paying for it./span",

For example, over the past year or so I've been studying, dabbling, or trying out the following: game development using Unity, technical analysis of stocks, Spanish, driving a car, and even some simple cooking! I've also been regularly practicing to improve my skills in writing and sketching. I probably even forgot a few things I've tried to learn. I also have a backlog of programming languages and frameworks I've been wanting to learn and/or try out.\r\n\r\nThere can be a tendency for some people, especially those tired of formal education, to fall into the trap of thinking that once they become adults they no longer need to learn new things or improve their skills, but an attitude towards continuous learning and improvement pushes us towards more fulfilling lives.\r\n\r\nThere are even certain professions such as software development or medicine where you pretty much have to keep up with the latest trends or new technologies in order to maintain your skill set. But even outside of such professions, a lifetime of learning can be enriching.\r\n\r\nThat's literally too. Learning and exposing yourself to new things is a process of growth and discovery that can lead you to better career options and be more financially rewarding. Scott Adams (creator of Dilbert) gave some advice that you can make yourself more valuable by combining two or more skills. The more skills you learn, the more likely you are to find a combination of skills that gives you the edge towards financial success.\r\n\r\nAt work, I've always been happy to take on tasks that required me to learn new frameworks or programming languages. Without an attitude towards continuous learning, your skills will stagnate. You'll be working on the same sort of tasks again and again, leading to boredom and unhappiness.\r\n\r\nApart from the possible financial rewards, continuous learning has a few other soft benefits. It keeps you mentally sharp and healthy even as you grow older. It can help you meet new people. It can give you new conversation topics with your friends. It builds your confidence and leads to trying even more new things. It helps you look at things and situations with fresh eyes or different angles. And it means you're almost never bored!\r\n\r\nIf you have kids, it sets an example for them that learning is a good thing and definitely you should be trying to instill the same example in them. Encourage their curiosity and facilitate their learning whenever they show interest in something, especially outside of school, to reinforce the idea that learning isn't something that can only happen in the classroom.\r\n\r\nIt can be exhausting sometimes to be trying to keep up with everything and learn new things all the time, but you owe it to yourself (and perhaps even to the world!) to continuously try to be a better person.\r\n\r",

Those same classes were only available during the first semester of each year, which meant I could not retake them during the second semester or over the summer to catch up. So effectively, I had fallen one year behind everyone I knew.\r\n\r\nWhen I got the news, it was devastating. Up until that time I had always been a pretty good student and I felt like I had always made my parents proud and happy. I did not know how I would tell them about it, I felt that I had failed them utterly. I knew I only had myself to blame as I had let most of these classes go by without paying much attention to them. Sometimes when you’re used to doing well academically all the time you might get lax and feel complacent and then you’re surprised to find out there’s a lot you haven’t picked up but it’s too late to catch up.\r\n\r\nMy parents were very understanding. My friends did not make fun of me or anything like that. I decided to take the failure for what it was -- a failure -- and simply learn from my mistakes and move on. I had to toughen up. I accepted that I would not be graduating on time, and that it was my own fault. I spent a semester under academic probation, but from that point onwards I did not fail any other classes, and I successfully graduated some years later, got a good job and so on.\r\n\r\nFailure is a setback yes, but it’s a setback you can learn from and that you can recover from. Failure is not fatal (most of the time -- obviously try not to fail at skydiving). As long as you can find a way to move forward there is no reason you would not be able to surpass it. In time you will look back on your failures as struggles that you learned from and made you stronger and more resilient\r\n\r\nThis post was originally written as a Quora response\r\n\r",

You want to be accurate and at the same time fair such that all programmers on your staff are evaluated in the same matter. However, there are no good, objective, universally accepted standard metrics.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the fact that there are no good, objective, universally accepted standard metrics for program size. Typically each programmer in a team will not be doing the same task or even the same type of task, so in order to produce fair evaluations you will need some standard metric of program size to normalize any evaluation. For example, you could choose to use code quality (bugs) as a metric for programmer performance, but not every programmer is assigned to do the same complexity of programs and some modules may be more poorly designed than others resulting in more bugs.\r\n\r\nLines of code is nice, until you realize that more lines of code does not necessarily mean a larger program or system, it may just mean your programmers don’t write particularly concise code. Often, different programmers will write the same program with different lines of code equally well. There are other possible metrics, but they all have different flaws and none of them capture the complexities of program size particularly well. Function points for example are meant to determine program size based on functional complexity but does not take into account technical complexity. Agile teams will often used a fuzzy metric called story points formed by team consensus but these are notoriously inaccurate and may change in relative size from sprint to sprint and definitely change in relative size across teams.\r\n\r\nWhat complicates things even more is that even the best, most senior programmers can slip into poor program quality due to schedule pressure, unreasonable clients or requirements, and so on.\r\n\r\nThere are some pitfalls too in trying to find accurate metrics. There are unpleasant stories of companies wanting to get a more accurate picture of how programmers spend their time so they monitor them while working or interview them regularly about how they work or insist that they maintain accurate timesheets even when working on multiple problems at the same time. Such methods may backfire and have a tendency to even reduce programmer productivity.\r\n\r\nWhat I would suggest (and probably is unavoidable) is instead a more subjective approach, combining multiple heuristics to get as fair an evaluation as possible. I would suggest something like the following combination:\r\n\r\n  Have the programmer define his own goals/targets for the evaluation period. At the end of the period, go over the goals with him and discuss how closely he came to meeting them. These may be quantitative targets or qualitative (\"I feel like my code has been of reasonably good quality\"). You can compare against the other feedback in this list if there’s any disagreement\r\n  Get feedback from a technical perspective from a mentor or senior developer who has worked closely with the programmer. The feedback can answer some simple questions like \"Is his technical skill adequate?\", \"Can he be assigned more complex functions?\", \"Has he been assigned the appropriate amount of work?\", \"\"Has he created any problems that someone of his skill level should not be expected to do?\", \"How has he contributed to the overall team?\", \"Does he provide good estimates?\" etc.\r\n  Get feedback from other people he has worked with. For people who haven’t worked that closely with him, the feedback will be leaning more towards soft skills rather than technical, i.e. how well he works with other people, how manageable he is, how helpful he is, and so on.\r\n\r\nAll of the above are subjective, but in combination should give you a relatively good picture of how well the programmer is performing relative to his peers. Optionally, you can combine it with whatever corporate-sanctioned metrics you need as well.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

I'm not sure why I never published it, though it does end on a dire note and seems a bit incomplete. Perhaps I had some further thoughts percolating in my brain back then that never came forward. I am also not sure if I wrote this before reading about The Great Filter. I figured I'd just publish it now without further comment:\r\n\r\nI was thinking about all the stupid things humans do, and the fact that there are still so many stupid humans about, and because of the stupid things human do like not focusing on education, we are creating even more stupid humans. It seemed to me like some sort of failure of evolution that we have not yet got it through our thick skulls how important stuff like education and critical thinking are.\r\n\r\nBut at some level, we're experiencing a different form of evolution, one that is applied to our society as a whole.\r\n\r\nConsider that in some other part of the universe, maybe at a nearby star or somewhere so far we have no way to imagine the distance, there probably exists an earthlike-planet. Maybe it has differences in terrain or weather, but for the most part it has seas and oceans, continents and archipelagos and glacial poles and all that jazz that makes earth interesting. And maybe on this other earth, life has evolved similar to the way it has here. Maybe some species are different, maybe some survived there that did not survive here, but for the most part there are plants and animals and insects and fungi and of course, there are humans.\r\n\r\nOf course these humans won't be exactly like us. Maybe they were spawned in different weather conditions, making the dominant skin tones different. Maybe they evolved slightly better or slightly worse eyesight or sense of smell. Maybe their superstitions were slightly different. Though in most ways this other human society on this other earth is similar with our own, all the slight differences are going to add up and the fate of their society may be vastly different with our own.\r\n\r\nMaybe because of their different superstitions, they are unable to survive massive plagues and disease in their middle ages. Maybe because of their differences they are unable to resist the temptation to devolve into thermonuclear war. Maybe they lack focus on technological advances and are unable to bridge the gap to the stars before their ever-growing population outgrows the resources their earth provides for them.\r\n\r\nIf the nature of humans on this other earth is close to what we have here -- selfish, bickering, superstitious, xenophobic then the odds of these humans able to evolve past their world and into the stars is pretty low.\r\n\r",

One of those was the concept of a relational database, and hence SQL. The company I worked at gave all new hires a training regimen that started with about a week of SQL. Despite not knowing anything about it beforehand, I took to it like a mouse takes to cheese. At the end of the week, they give you an exam to see how well you understood the material, and my batchmate who I took the course with likes to tell people that halfway through the allocated time for the exam, I was already taking a nap./span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"The fact that in my first project I had to port a lot of reports meant I was able to apply what I learned and learn even more easily. I would find as time went on that these bespoke projects typically included hundreds of different reports. The users would always want to see so-and-so data over time or compared with other sets of data, or summary reports of data over weeks, months, years, and so on. And when these systems are being developed, the reports are typically among the last to be finalized, which means that the database structure is almost always optimized towards the needs of the functions needed to maintain the data, and not towards reporting on that data. This typically led to reports that had really long and complicated SQL statements that would look intimidating to newbies. I didn’t mind, I treated each large SQL as a puzzle to be solved and understood./span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"About a year and a half later, I got tapped to be a trainer in the company for the first time, and I would be training people on SQL. Training other people gave me a better appreciation of how hard SQL was for other people. When I was in college, I understood that certain subjects could be considered as \"filters\" that many people will not pass and should take as a sign that the course of study was not for them. An example was the Introduction to Computer Science class that most engineering students have to take. Programming is hard and needs a certain mindset, so many people would fail or do poorly in that course, and if you were a Computer Science major it was a clear sign as to whether you should continue that course or not. SQL had that same property -- I found out that it was a pretty good indicator of whether certain developers would do well in the company or not. /span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"As I mentioned, the company’s SQL training course was a week long. You could typically tell which trainees would be having trouble by the third day -- that was the day that joins would start to be discussed. Joins where were the men got separated from the boys as it were. SQL joins could not be treated the same way as other programming problems, they were not best solved in an iterative or procedural matter, but rather should be approached by an understanding of set theory. You had to figure out the particular set of results you wanted to retrieve and what set operations needed to be done on the data in order to get those results. Most of the trainees having trouble with SQL would find it difficult to wrap their heads around this concept./span\r\n\r\nOur SQL training was decidedly Oracle-specific, instead of adhering strictly to the ANSI syntax. We preferred teaching Oracle-specific syntax: DECODE instead of CASE, joining by saying \"from TABLE1, TABLE2\" instead of the more modern \"from TABLE1 join TABLE2 on ... \". I am not even sure if at that time Oracle already supported the more modern/standardized syntax.\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Another thing about the SQL course was that we had to teach SQL performance tuning. It was a subject matter that was hard to teach because providing examples was so difficult. SQL that has a performance problem is typically long, complicated, and involves a number of tables that would require a certain level of domain knowledge. So we would end up providing simple examples and a list of tips for writing SQL (avoid sorts, full scans, distincts, etc) and we had to hope that the trainees would remember these tips when they start writing their own SQL for their projects. Even after a decade later, I would find myself glaring at developers who never learned to avoid using UNION instead of UNION ALL where possible. /span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"For projects with a lot of reports, SQL performance was a big deal, especially when reports were expected to be generated interactively by the user online (as opposed to in the background by batch)/span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"SQL performance tuning involved a relatively straightforward procedure: review the execution plan for the SQL (can be extracted from the database), and try to minimize the number of full table scans and unnecessary sorts. Oracle execution plans typically will even give you a cost for each operation, making it easy to identify which operations are more important to optimize. You also needed some idea of the volume of data on each table. It was more important to minimize full scans and sorts for larger data sets./span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"To remove full table scans, you typically had to introduce new indexes. You had to identify which WHERE conditions could benefit the most from an index. Some WHERE conditions could not use an index, and you would need to figure out if there was a way to rewrite the conditions that would allow an index to be used. Minimizing sorts means removing unnecessary set operations that require sorting (typically UNION, INTERSECT, MINUS, DISTINCT, that kind of thing). Sometimes the order in which tables in the SQL were evaluated would also matter, so you had to rewrite the SQL such that the faster operations would be done first in order to reduce the data volume before the more expensive operations come in./span\r\n\r\nspan style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Sometimes all of these tips and tricks wouldn’t work and you would spend hours on end trying to figure out how to get an SQL performing better. I once spent more than a day in my first project trying to figure out how to tune a report that was taking more than one day to execute. The usual tricks weren’t working, but I eventually figured out that it would be faster to separate the data into two subsets and perform different filtering conditions on each set, then combine using a UNION ALL. (In Oracle a UNION ALL performed no sorting, so it was relatively safe). It was the first real SQL tuning I was proud of, my team leader was amazed when the succeeding runs of the report took a matter of seconds./span",

Where previously there were gatekeepers in traditional media channels who controlled whose opinions could be published or broadcast, the internet meant that anyone with an internet connection could publish and voice out their thoughts and people would be all smart and there would be lots of intelligent discussion and it would be great.\r\n\r\nAnd that did kind of happen -- there was now a wealth of information and opinions and discussions online -- but people being people there was a lot of silly, frivolous stuff too. Memes, jokes, 4chan, and all that. And that was all fine and great.\r\n\r\nBut there was some dark stuff too. Spammers and scammers and whatnot trying to take advantage of people. And more recently with all the political activity it seemed like it had come to a head. Lies, damn lies and propaganda. It had always been happening before, but now the scales were larger and the stakes were higher.\r\n\r\nInstead of discussing opposing points of view, people joined social media groups  supporting one side or another, discussions giving way to echo chambers and crowds castigating people who didn't share their views. Online trolls were paid to harass opposing personalities and reinforce their benefactor's propaganda. Outright false information was spread using social media.\r\n\r\nAnd it was our fault too. We seek out those opinions that feed our biases and don't bother questioning their veracity. Many times we don't even bother reading past the clickbait headlines and make judgments without all the information because who has time for all that context right? Many acted like fanatics where their side could do no wrong and the other side were demons who could do no right.\r\n\r\nA friend of mine, disgusted with the outright lies and propaganda of the opposing camps, has started censoring comments he disagrees with on his posts. I felt that stifling discussion was counterproductive, but he insisted that in this new era, a wide variety of approaches was necessary, with both moderates maintaining balanced views and encouraging discussion; and fanatics pushing aggressively to counter the opposing propaganda. Perhaps it was true, but it lessened my hopes that we would be able to raise the standard of online discussion to a higher level.\r\n\r\nWhen I started writing this post the original title was \"The Unfulfilled Promise of Social Media\", but I realized the adjective there wasn't appropriate. If anything, the promise of democratized discussion has been completely fulfilled -- I had just forgotten that democracy did not necessarily mean people would be smarter or more enlightened. Just like in real-life we are vulnerable to charlatans and demagogues and lies and propaganda.\r\n\r\nAll the more reason we need to be vigilant with what we read, share, comment and post online. We need to give adequate consideration to opposing points of view, to weigh the facts against speculation. We need to learn and apply critical thinking, and to teach other people to do so. We should strive to elevate discussions to higher levels (although it can often be tiring to do so!). It is an ongoing struggle for me to improve and be critical of my own thinking, but I believe it to be a worthy cause.",

Obviously it was difficult for me to judge given that I didn't know all the details, but for me it was most likely a vulnerability introduced in the application code itself.\r\n\r\nIf you're not familiar with file upload vulnerability, the simplest type of attack goes something like this: the user (or attacker in this case) uploads a file using a file upload function on the system (a common functionality), and the system allows the user to execute that file as if it were code. This can happen if the application saves the uploaded file directly into the web application path, such that it can be executed directly from the client. This is a common vulnerability listed on the OWASP page.\r\n\r\nFor example, your application provides a function to upload an image to use as the user's profile picture, then the applications stores the uploaded image in the file system directly in the application path such that it is served to the user as something like /images/uploadedfile.png. However, if the user uploads instead a file that can be executed directly by the web server, such as a .PHP file for PHP webservers or a .JSP file for Java containers, the user can now execute any code that was in his uploaded file simply by invoking /images/uploadedfile.php! And this access would be absolute, everything your system has access to will be fair game: file system, network, database, etc., and provides the attacker with more information for succeeding attacks.\r\n\r\nThe key to protecting yourself from file upload vulnerabilities is one of the basic tenets of web application security: Never trust user submitted data. This means that you should validate uploaded files -- maybe you only allow image files for example -- and your validation should be thorough. You shouldn't validate only be checking the file extension or the content type in the HTTP header, as these can be faked. Use a server-side API call to verify the file type.\r\n\r\nIn addition, do not store or serve the uploaded files in a way that they will be executed by the web application. For Java webapps I've worked on, often we will store uploaded files in the Oracle database, and when they need to be served they are dumped directly into the response OutputStream. If you must store the uploads in the file system, do it in a location that is not accessible from the web server directly. For J2EE containers that can be inside /WEB-INF/ or outside the application path itself. For PHP, it should be outside the HTTP doc folder of the Apache server.\r\n\r\nFor the PHP example above, you should also avoid serving the image files using a PHP include. If the URL to access the image is something like uploadedimage?image\\id=1 and your code maps that image\\id to a file on the file system and serves it using a PHP include, it will still be executed by the system as code. Instead the file should be dumped directly into the response. One way to do it is as follows:\r\n\r\n pre&lt;?php\r\nheader('Content-Type: [whatever your content type is]');\r\nheader(\"Content-Disposition: inline; filename=\\\"$file_name\\\"\");\r\necho $file;\r\n?&gt;/pre\r\n\r\nThis is only the most basic attack. File upload functions can be exploited in a number of other ways. For example, the attacker could upload a number of large files to attempt to take down your server due to insufficient disk space (prevention: restrict file upload size, prevent user uploading too many files). So developers need to be carefully in how they allow file uploads in their system and be aware of possible vulnerabilities and exploits, the OWASP page linked above lists some more prevention measures.",

It took a few years for the Philippines to catch on, the first internet connection in the country was only set up in 1994.\r\n\r\nMy personal experience with the internet came a bit later, during our freshman year in University, sometime in the schoolyear 1995-1996. Around that time a couple of friends and I would walk out to this computer shop along Katipunan avenue that had internet access. Computer shops weren't prolific back then, and most of them offered only document editing and printing services. They didn't even have LAN gaming back then, as DOOM had only come out the year before and Starcraft was just a gleam in Blizzard's eye. This particular computer shop we trekked to had 2-3 terminals with internet access, which at that time we mostly used to browse anime-related websites and fanfiction (RIP Anime Web Turnpike)\r\n\r\nInternet usage grew quickly in the succeeding years. A couple of friends got internet connections first. One of them lived near the University so a bunch of us happened to hang out there often, not just for internet access but also to read manga and watch anime. We jokingly referred to his house as \"the Entertainment Capital of UP Village\"\r\n\r\nI forget when we got our own internet connection at home. I don't even remember the provider we used. We stuck with one of the monthly plans for a while, but also went through a period of trying out prepaid internet access plans (RIP ISP Bonanza) and sometimes even hacking a free email service to also give me internet access (RIP Edsamail). It was the days of dial-up modems and beeping sounds, when piracy consisted of arcane commands issued in dark IRC channels. (The first time I got pirated music wasn't off the internet however -- for some reason I had gotten an MP3 of Oasis' Wonder Wall on floppy disks. Yes, multiple disks).\r\n\r\nAside from the piracy and the fanfiction, the internet was a treasure trove of information. I quickly learned the usual web development skills -- HTML and CSS were relatively easy, and I had a geocities website set up back in the day, a strange green-text-on-black-background kind of thing (I was never particularly good at web design). My email address for most of the university years was a Yahoo one (RIP Yahoo 2016), which I often used to join discussion groups on various geeky topics like video games and anime and what not -- these days we have reddit for that.\r\n\r\nToday, internet in the Philippines has come a long way and is a big part of daily life for most people. There's still a lot of improvement to go -- broadband here is still very expensive and very slow compared to other countries and there is no real competition yet, something hopefully to be solved soon.\r\n\r\nWhat was your first encounter with the internet?\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2016/08/06/the-worlds-first-website-went-online-25-years-ago-today/\r\n [2]: http://www.interaksyon.com/infotech/philippine-internet-connection-turns-20-years-old-this-month\r",

There are different kinds of standards to consider, but generally I break them down into design standards and coding standards. Standards are important not only to ensure consistency among the development team, but to ease transitions both for new team members coming into the project late, or team members moving laterally to other positions or sub-teams within the same project\r\n\r\nDesign standards are generally UI and functionality related. UI standards can refer to what kind of controls are preferred to be used, where screen elements are expected to be placed, how error messages are presented, that sort of thing.\r\n\r\nFunctionality standards are more to establish similar user expectations as to how the program works. When I click Save, can I continue editing the same record or does it send me back to a listing screen? When I delete a record, is it reversible or will the system warn me that the deletion is permanent? When I enter a search criteria, is it case-sensitive? Having similar behavior throughout the system makes it more intuitive for users to navigate large, complex systems.\r\n\r\nCoding standards refer to standards that developers follow, and will typically encompass:\r\n\r\n  Naming conventions. Applicable to variables, files, database tables and fields, and so on. This can be difficult to enforce, as some part of it is subjective. But it's important that the same things are always named the same way in different parts of the code. It can be more difficult in larger development teams that are split among different domains. A simple example is one sub-team might name their reference number database field REF\\NO while another sub-team sues REF\\NUM. At the very least having consistent naming will make it more intuitive for developers reaching across different domains to link fields to each other\r\n  Speaking of database fields, another thing to consider is data types and field length. It can be unpleasant to find out later on in the development process that one sub-team has used VARCHAR(35) for all their email fields while another one has used VARCHAR(70). Or maybe some tables have a reference number field as an integer while others have it as a string. Such inconsistencies can lead to integration problems later on\r\n  Code formatting. Generally covers indentation, bracket placement, spacing, etc. This is generally only an aesthetic choice, but may cause religious wars with some developer groups (\"tabs vs spaces!!!\"), but generally someone should just choose a standard and the developers follow it. Luckily, modern IDEs support autoformatting options that can be exported and distributed for all the developers to use, eliminating most such issues. If not enforced in this manner, it may create some issues though if different developers have different autoformat settings. For example, in one project I was on a certain developer had an autoformat setting to automatically declare as final any function parameters in Java files. This was an ok practice on its own, but he was the only one with that setting, so when he would make a change to a Java file written by someone else, those \"final\" keywords would be added automatically. It wasn't an issue most of the time, but when I had to check changes in source control, it would often be troublesome trying to isolate what change he had made in large files since there were all these other irrelevant changes found by the diff. Enforcing a standard formatting eliminates such issues\r\n  File organisation -- a software project will typically have hundreds if not thousands of different files of varying types. Some sort of scheme is necessary for developers to follow to ensure order. For example in a web development project, HTML templates should be placed in a specific folder, CSS files in a different folder, JavaScript files in a different folder, and so on. Often there will also be subfolders either by domain or functionality\r\n  Implementation standards -- typically in my projects I've found a need to standardize the approach for similar types of functions. For example, all search screens should be implemented a certain way, etc. Can be enforced by either language constructs or code templates\r\n  Best practices -- many organisations will have their own set of coding best practices designed to help avoid common problems\r\n  Other, program-specific standards. For example, your Java project may require that all classes of a certain type use a particular form of constructor. If you're lucky, such standards can be enforced using language constructs such as interfaces, but that is not always the case\r\n\r\nIdeally, all of the above standards are codified in some sort of standards document that the development team can reference on a regular basis. But due to the constantly evolving nature of software projects, most teams will find that the typical documentation problems arise for standards documentation:\r\n\r\n  You often won't know ahead of time all the kinds of standards you need. Often later in the project new situations will arise that need standards but either the team may not recognize it or will not have time to document\r\n  Standards will often become out of date or irrelevant. Updating these documents will often not be a priority as schedule pressure mounts\r\n  As the problems from 1 and 2 mount up, more and more knowledge that should be codified as standards instead become unwritten tribal wisdom that can only be learned by experience or consultation with the experts\r\n  After a certain point, adding new things to the standards document becomes counter-productive. When there are too many standards to follow, it becomes a challenge to even be aware of them all much less enforce them\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult problem to solve, and probably impossible to solve completely. I believe we will have to live with all of the problems above to some degree. There are a few ways to mitigate the effects:\r\n\r\n  Automate whenever possible. There are now many modern tools to automate checking for code formatting issues and so on\r\n  Prepare standards documents/bibles for the most common cases\r\n  Prepare step-by-step implementation guides and code templates for commonly-done tasks/functions. (Examples: \"How to implement search screens\", \"How to integrate our workflow library\", etc) -- guides and templates don't guarantee adherence, but they should help reduce incidents of standards not being followed\r\n  Mentoring for new team members or those transitioning to new roles\r\n  Recognize and accept that as project teams get larger, there will be a greater overhead spent on ensuring standards are followed and that the team is aware of them\r\n\r\nAll of the above are my own thoughts arising from my own project experience. I haven't read much outside literature on this subject or other approaches within the industry at large, so I'd be happy to get more information on this matter",

It comes and it goes. It's easily distracted. It can vanish in a blink of an eye. When it's there, it's great, but when it's not you don't get anything done and you don't feel terrible. Motivation is based on the principle that you need a certain emotion or state of mind to get things done. Motivation is burst damage, you can get a lot done but you don't know when it's gonna come out.\r\n\r\nDiscipline is a harsh mistress. Discipline means doing things no matter what. It means you do what you need to do even if you're uninspired, or tired, or exhausted. It means you gather all the mental blocks and the excuses and the urge to go do something else, and you power through all of these and do what you needed to do in spite of all of these. Discipline means that your goals are independent of emotional whims, that they need to get done no matter how you're feeling. Discipline is DPS, it's constant work that can get boring, but it will surely get the job done.\r\n\r\n... I need more discipline.",

Examples of small enough technical problems include list sorting, comparison, arithmetic operations, path traversal, string concatenation, returning a string as an HTTP response, rendering text to the screen, retrieving submitted parameters from an HTTP request, and so on. Any given non-trivial software project will be broken down into thousands, possibly hundreds of thousands of such small tasks, some occurring more often under different contexts.\r\n\r\nThe job of the software developer designed to implement such a program or some part of a program is to identify all those tiny tasks and the order in which they need to be done, then actually do it and put it all together in a way that satisfies the software's requirements. Finding out the proper arrangement of tasks is a form of design in and of itself, separate from the design of the software requirements. This is why many programmers will tell you that coding itself is both design and implementation -- the coder still has to make numerous small decisions, rearranging code and tasks until he finds the correct arrangement that works to satisfy your needs.\r\n\r\nInvariably, practically all of these tiny tasks are either trivial to implement (based on knowledge the programmer already has), or have already been implemented somewhere else by some other programmer. This is why Q&A sites such as Stack Overflow are very useful for the modern programmer -- you simply dip your pool into the communal knowledge of the programming community and most of the time the programmers who have solved the same problem before will tell you how they did it.\r\n\r\n\"Practically all\" means in the rare instance, you will still encounter problems that as far as you can tell have yet to be solved by anyone else in the world. I am unsure if there is anything quite as depressing to the programmer as finally finding a single Google hit about that one problem he was unable to solve only to find that it was a link to his own unanswered Stack Overflow question from months before.\r\n\r\nOften this happens when you are doing something or some combination of things so obscure no one else has tried it before, or when you are legitimately blazing new ground. It largely depends on the field you are working in -- if you are using proven frameworks to build your 10th web application, most likely 999 out of every 1,000 problems you have are already solved. On the other hand, if you were maybe writing drivers for a new piece of hardware, or maybe writing a new framework to be used at the same time as the first application using it, that number shoots up considerably.\r\n\r\nWhat to do when faced with such a situation where all the sources you consult -- mentors, experts, textbooks, the internet, and so on -- are unable to help you solve the problem and it stops you from moving forward? Well, if you can sense that trying to solve the problem on your own or brute forcing it in some manner may waste a lot of time that you can't afford, you should remember what I said above: *Writing software is about breaking down large problems into a series of very small technical problems for which we already have solutions. *This means your first choice should be to check first if there is an alternative arrangement of tasks for which that particular problem could be avoided (that is, \"re-design your code to work around the problem\"). You shouldn't box yourself into a particular sequence of steps, be willing to \"think outside the box\" to look for other solutions that while not immediately obvious, may be more feasible (i.e. \"already solved\")\r\n\r\nThis method of iterating the arrangements of parts until the software works might seem a bit clunky, but I've found it useful to think in this manner -- it makes even the impossible problems seem feasible. Now, if only problems with humans could be solved just be rearranging things... \r\n\r",

Software development often ranks in the top 10 highest-earning careers in most countries\r\n  There is a lot of scope -- you could be developing web applications, mobile applications, embedded applications, client-side, server-side, data analysis, artificial intelligence, games, etc\r\n  It is very difficult to be bored. You can always automate away the boring stuff. Different projects always present different challenges. The field is evolving rapidly so there are always new things to learn.\r\n  It is both a creative endeavor and a technical endeavor\r\n  Lots of opportunities for remote work/working from home, if that is your thing\r\n  You get to work with a lot of smart people\r\n  Access to a worldwide community of people who think in a similar manner. Most beginner and intermediate problems easily solved through the internet\r\n  Generally, working in a programming company is more likely to be a meritocracy -- people with better technical skill are more likely to be valued\r\n  There are a lot of opportunities -- if you are unhappy where you are, you can easily look for another opportunity\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\n  It is not for everybody. It requires a certain type of thinking that you may or may not be used to. Typically the field needs the ability to think logically and incrementally (step-by-step through how things happen) and to understand how multiple components work and interact together. More advanced challenges will also require significant out of the box thinking\r\n  After some time, you will tend to interpret things more literally. This is a side effect of working with computer programs that may affect your social interactions\r\n  Many people outside of the field will often find it difficult to understand the amount of work that goes into a computer program. This can lead to difficult conversations, especially with clients\r\n  Your nonprogrammer friends and relatives will often ask you for technical help, even though you know nothing about their printer and will most likely just google the information\r\n  Typically, the industry is very bad at estimation and scheduling, leading to a lot of overtime and the corresponding stress\r\n  The field is evolving rapidly, so there is often a need for a career programmer to self-educate to remain up-to-date with current trends\r\n  Encountering a highly difficult problem that no one else has been able to solve may drive you insane\r\n\r\n(Previously published as an answer on Quora)",

I thought it might be overhyped, but it's not. And I can see why people find it hard to explain without spoiling things.\r\n\r\nIt's about strange things happening in a small town. Creepy things. It's a mystery. It's suspense. It's not a jump-scare sort of thing if you're not into that. Well, there's maybe a little bit of jump scares. The best description I'd say it's about as scary as an X-Files or Doctor Who episode. So if that's not too scary for you, you'll be fine\r\n\r\nIt's about a child who goes missing in a small town (not a spoiler) and the succeeding events. It's about the mother searching for her son. It's about a group of kids trying to solve a mystery. It's about a small-town police chief in over his head. It's about the 80s. It's about kids in the 80s, music in the 80s, school in the 80s, small American towns in the 80s. It's about outcasts and bullies and first times and trying to fit in and how they all deal with these stranger things\r\n\r\nIt's like Stephen King wrote an episode of X-Files and it was directed by Stephen Spielberg starring the cast of Stand By Me. The acting is great too, especially the kids\r\n\r\nMaybe minor spoilers follow\r\n\r\nIt's kind of told in that weird True Detective way, with perspectives jumping around a lot among the ensemble cast. Past and present scenes are interspersed with only context to rely on\r\n\r\nIt keeps you hooked. I wanted to watch only a couple of episodes at first but ended up awake past three AM at episode six. I finished it the net morning\r\n\r\nI love how the mystery unfolds to different parties and separately they uncover parts of it and they all come together in the end to force a resolution. I love how the characters overcome their horror-movie tropes. I love all the 80s references and the geeky references\r\n\r\nI was satisfied with how it ended and all came together. I'm not sure what to expect for a second season though",

Estimation has long been the bane of many software developers and software development projects. But there are two secret ways to be able to produce perfect estimates for software development work all the time! One is dependent on talent, and the other is dependent on technology\r\n\r\n  Psychic precognition, i.e. be able to predict the future\r\n  Have a time machine, so you can go back in time and tell yourself how long the work would have taken\r\n\r\nSuch precognition is necessary to have perfect estimates because of all the unknowns present at the start of a software project. Unknowns include imperfect requirements or design, unknown user needs, future changes that may happen during the course of the project, unforeseen technical challenges, and so on\r\n\r\nIn the absence of the ability to break the laws of causality however, the only time we can have perfect estimates is at the end of the project! Before that, we are sadly restricted to imperfect estimates. In reality, the best estimates will still always be an educated guess\r\n\r\nOkay, for real now: there are two ways to handle the risks associated with poor estimates, and for most projects both will be necessary.\r\n\r\nThe first is *to plan around inaccurate estimates. *This means that your planning acknowledges that estimates will often be inaccurate and building a sufficient amount of loose or buffer time in your scheduling to accommodate any variance. Less enlightened managers and executives will hate this, especially anyone who comes from a world like manufacturing where the rate of production is extremely well-known and predictable. They will view any kind of schedule buffer as some sort of justification for slacking off. As a software developer, you will have to deal with these sorts of people throughout your career. It will be part of your job to work with them to manage the schedule, manage their expectations, and get them to understand that while the software development process is in many ways an engineering process, there are still numerous uncertainties that will not resolve themselves until you find the right arrangement of code\r\n\r\nThe second is to learn how to make better estimates. \"Better\" here doesn't necessarily mean \"more accurate\", but rather \"less likely to be very far off\". There are numerous books already written on this subject (I recommend Steve McConnell's Software Estimation: Demystifying the Black Art_ _if you can afford it), but basically the advice can always be summed up as: use data from previous experiences to predict the likely effort needed for future tasks.\r\n\r\nIt's usually best if you are able to draw upon your own experiences since often the actual amount of work needed will be specific to the developer's experience, for example: \"It took me N days to do a similar task before, so I think I can do it in N+2 days. The other guy doesn't have experience with this stack, so I guess that he can do it in N+7 days\"\r\n\r\nIn the absence of your own direct experience, you can look to either expert opinion (consult someone else who has more experience with the subject and ask him for an estimate, and compensate accordingly for any difference in skill/knowledge) or use some sort of numerical model. Such models will typically rely on some sort of metric to measure the size of the system being developed, then use historical data to predict how much effort a system of this size would require. An example of such models is Function Point Analysis. Different models will tend to have their own advantages and disadvantages -- for example, I've found from personal experience that Function Point Analysis can be greatly inaccurate if there is a lot of technical risk in the proposed system -- so it would still be wise to make planning adjustments accordingly and not just follow the model blindly\r\n\r\nOne last thing that software developers need to note with regard to estimates: if you know that you have made a good estimate, that it is already as accurate as it could possibly be: do not allow anyone to pressure you into providing a different estimate. Giving in to such pressure does no one any good: it only puts the project at increased risk, and it puts your own credibility into question. Such pressure often comes from management or clients as a result of schedules or deadlines, something that I will talk about in a later post.\r\n\r\nIn the end though, all the best practices will be for naught unless you understand the fundamental truth: there is always a chance for estimates to be inaccurate. No amount of planning or best practices can completely mitigate that risk -- unless of course you have either a precognitive crystal ball or time machine!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2016/08/programming-is-finding-the-right-arrangement-of-code/\r\n [2]: https://www.amazon.com/Software-Estimation-Demystifying-Developer-Practices-ebook/dp/8178531038/\r",

However, the intent of a general education program isn't specifically to give you knowledge that will be useful to you in the future (although it may turn out to be so)\r\n\r\nThe stuff school teaches you -- literature, mathematics, art, history, science, and so on -- are intended to give you a broad enough base from which you can freely choose the direction you want to go in life. This means that as you specialize, many of these subjects may become \"irrelevant\" to you, but having this broad base of knowledge gives you a better foundation in life. Knowledge from unrelated fields can often give useful insight into your own specialized field\r\n\r\nThat being said, the most useful stuff you learn from school isn’t the stuff that’s in the lectures or in the textbooks. School is supposed to teach you about more than formulas and history dates too. But it's a problem that most of the time, formal education doesn't deliver the lessons well enough. Math shouldn't be about memorizing formulas or equations, but about developing analytical and problem solving skills. History should be about appreciating how changes affect people and societies, not about memorizing dates. Science should be about appreciating how nature works and developing scientific curiosity. And so on. But because these things are difficult to teach and test for, formal education usually focuses on facts and figures and formulas and all these things that appear in exams. It's up to the student (or his mentors encourage him) to apply himself further\r\n\r\nThere are still many more holes in formal education. There are memes about how you learn not so useful stuff like \"mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell\" instead of real-world useful things like how to manage your finance or how to do your taxes. And for sure we need more of those practical things taught to students.\r\n\r\nBut the most important things you learn from school are in the methods of learning and working well with others. School teaches how to apply yourself, how to study and pick up new material, how to listen to other people, how to determine which knowledge is useful to learn, how to discern truth from fiction, how to work within a set of rules, how to manage your time, how to deal with schedules and deadlines, how to work well with other people, how to deal with difficult people, and so on. In short, the most important lessons school teaches you are about how to deal with the real world",

Spend some time alone with your thoughts regularly; solitude has its benefits\r\n 11. In most situations, a balanced approach will serve you well. Extreme or fanatical views will rarely be good\r\n 12. Occasionally try again things you earlier dismissed, in case that they have improved or your own tastes have changed\r\n 13. When in doubt and things are urgent, pick one option randomly and go.\r\n 14. Don't be afraid to speak your mind\r\n 15. Life is too short to waste time on things that you don't enjoy or don't help you grow or people who don't appreciate you\r\n 16. It's never too late to be who you were meant to be\r\n 17. If it's important to you, keep track of it\r\n 18. The world is too amazing to be bored\r\n 19. It's okay to be weird and/or random every so often\r\n 20. Life has no meaning except what meaning you give it\r\n 21. All things, whether good or bad, shall eventually pass. Enjoy the good while it lasts, persist through the bad until you make it through\r\n 22. Avoid doing or saying things in anger or hatred\r\n 23. Things change and people change, sometimes for reasons we can't ever explain. Learn to roll with life's punches\r\n 24. The world is filled with people who are terrible, cruel, or manipulative. That doesn't mean there aren't good people out there and that doesn't mean you should mistrust everybody. \"Do not let the world make you hard\"\r\n 25. Don't worry too much about things that you can't understand or can't change. Focus only on things you can affect and that matter to you\r\n 26. Quality is nice, but quantity often works too. Many failed or mediocre attempts will eventually converge towards a quality success\r\n 27. Learn to accept when things need to end. Let go or be dragged\r\n 28. Sometimes you just need the courage to power through the difficult parts\r\n 29. For many things, the best way to improve is with time and practice and effort\r\n 30. Learn from the past, look to the the future, but live in the present\r\n 31. Life isn't fair. Just because you've done all the right things doesn't mean you'll get what you want, even if you feel like you deserve it (the converse is also true -- even if you do all the wrong things you won't necessarily get punished for it)\r\n 32. Strive to be fair and honest with people you deal with. Give credit where credit is due\r\n 33. In order to learn, teach. In order to lead, follow\r\n 34. When you are ahead, strive for stability and balance. When you are behind, be willing to gamble\r\n 35. Always keep learning and improving. Every day, try to improve yourself or learn something new\r\n 36. Every once in a while, expand your horizons with new things or different points of view\r\n 37. Words are wind. Reinforce your words with deeds\r\n 38. Age is merely a state of mind",

But for the most part I've restricted it to those channels and have tried to avoid posting about current events in the country on this blog (outside of my personal choices for the election), but I feel that now more than ever those of us who can speak out have a responsibility to do so whenever we can, for several reasons\r\n\r\nVillage Idiot Savant says:\r\n\r\n \"Third, write. But don’t write as you would for the consumption of social media, write instead to keep a record of these times. Write in long form, write reflections, write your frustrations, write with big words, write even if it appears you are rambling. Write with Art and with Irony. Because we will eventually emerge from this period of madness, hopefully to a season of sanity, and we will need to look back and remember, and if needed, to indict. Write because it will someday be history.\"\r\n\r\nThat last part resonated with me. \"Write because it will someday be history.\" It reminds me of where we are currently with the Marcos legacy, with an entire generation having been brainwashed to believe that Marcos was actually a hero and a positive influence on this country, all because in the intervening years since the EDSA revolution we (and by we I mean we the people, not just the government) grew complacent and believed that exile was sufficient and that we would not have to worry again about such a dark time in our society to come back and haunt us again\r\n\r\nAnd yet here we are again on a road, perhaps even a slippery slope, towards a dark future. Marcos is again being glorified, and the state is once again extending its reach with the similar excuse of \"peace and order\". We do not yet know where this path ultimately leads, perhaps it won't be the darkness many of us can foresee, perhaps we as a society are able to turn away from the brink before it is too late. There are those who believe it is already too late, that we are already in the darkest timeline\r\n\r\nEven if our country falls under a shroud of darkness, like the darkness of Martial Law it will also eventually pass and hopefully we emerge on the other side stronger and wiser as a country. In the hopes of that light beyond the darkness, we must write. We must take our voices and speak out against what ills we see. It often feels futile, with many of our countrymen already having surrendered their wills to the violence. Many are unwilling to listen, many treat the current leadership as if they are infallible demigods who could do no wrong. Maybe there is really no one listening and you are but a lone voice crying in the wilderness. It is not for them that we need to write, but for those of us who still hope for a better future. And for those in the future to recognize and learn from the mistakes of our time\r\n\r\nWe must write and speak, while we still can. We don't know whether we will still be able to speak up tomorrow.\r\n\r\nIn addition, we should write to spite those who would silence us for our opposition. For many of the administration's supporters, anyone who speaks out is an open target for harassment and accusations most vile, as one of Rappler's correspondents recently found out:\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 766531070116278272 }}\r\n\r\nI can appreciate those of my friends who limit themselves to \"like\"s on the posts of those who speak up, or who limit their support to private discussions. Not everyone has the liberty to speak up. Not everyone can afford to sacrifice time nor ego to the possibility of a horde of online trolls pouncing on you. Not everyone can afford to be stressed out over this. Not everyone has the temperament to be willing to offend other people or risk losing friendships. All the more reason for those of us who are able to speak up to keep on going and to persist in the face of overwhelming ignorance and hypocrisy. The ones who cannot afford to speak, we speak for them too\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons I didn't write about this too much on this blog is that I didn't want this channel to become about politics. But it feels like so much more than just politics now. Despite what some fanatics may have you believe, we do not voice opposition simply because we believe in another camp or because we want to destroy the current administration. We voice opposition because we want the best for our country, and we believe that these issues -- the continuing demonization of human rights and due process, encouragement of a culture of killing and violence, intellectual dishonesty and willful ignorance, and so on -- are issues worth raising up and discussing\r\n\r\nI am sure I have friends and family who are tired of me bringing up such subjects. At least one person has unfriended me already without explanation, although circumstances dictate it was about \"politics\". For my friends and family, I apologize. If you are tired of me speaking up, please trust that I am tired too\r\n\r\n [1]: http://twitter.com/roytang\r",

If I were in charge of these investigations, these are the some of the questions I'd want answered:\r\n\r\n(Disclaimers: I'm not a lawyer or any kind of expert. Understandably, the resource persons may be reluctant to answer some of these in open session, in which case an executive session could be done. Some may have already been asked/answered during the hearings and I just missed them as I do not watch all the sessions live. Additional or different sets of resource persons may need to be called upon)\r\n\r\nDrug war and prevalence:\r\n\r\n  Are there any official marching orders regarding the drug war? What are they?\r\n  What is the prevalence of drug usage in the country?\r\n  How many drug users are there?\r\n  Where does this data come from?\r\n  How does the prevalence compare with previous years and administrations?\r\n  How does the prevalence (per capita) compare with other countries, particularly those with similar economic levels?\r\n  What are the sources of intel that leads to the \"drug watchlists\"?\r\n  What are the sources of intel that lead to the president's \"narco-list\"?\r\n  How do our tactics in this drug war compare to those of other countries with similar programs? Which of those countries have been successful?\r\n  Do we have data on the prevalence of drug usage during the president's term in Davao? Have the harsh methods proven to be effective?\r\n  Do we have any updated data since the \"drug war\" began? Has the drug prevalence gone down?\r\n  Do we have any quantifiable target for the \"drug war\"? When do we declare success? Can we receive regular updates?\r\n\r\nDrug surrenderees:\r\n\r\n  How many of the drug surrenderees were previously on police watchlists?\r\n  How many came forward vs rounded up by the police?\r\n  What are the consequences for not coming forward?\r\n  How many of the surrenderees surrendered or gave confessions with the benefit of legal counsel? Are they entitled to legal counsel?\r\n  Have any of the surrenderees later been found to still be involved in drug operations?\r\n  There are reports of people mistakenly added to these surrenderee lists or forced to come forward, are the police investigating them?\r\n\r\nSuspects killed during police operations (\"nanlaban\"):\r\n\r\n  How many drug-related operations have the police conducted? How does this rate compare with previous years and administrations?\r\n  How many suspects are killed vs arrested? How does this rate compare with previous years and administrations?\r\n  How do the above rates compare with other countries, particularly those with similar drug prevalence rates? How does it compare with other countries that have ongoing \"drug wars\"?\r\n  How many cases of suspects killed during police operations are under investigation? Who conducts the investigations? Do they have enough resources?\r\n  What are the rules of engagement during police operations? Are all officers given the proper training re: these rules?\r\n  Are there any resources or other things that could be provided to the police to help minimize unnecessary loss of life?\r\n  What is the protocol/procedure when a suspect is killed during a police operation? Is there any automatic investigation or counseling for the officer involved?\r\n  Is there any autopsy or other forensic analysis done on suspects killed during police operations? Are they checked for powder burns, or for fingerprints on the alleged weapon they used? Ballistics matching on bullets recovered at the scene?\r\n  Is it possible that some officers are becoming overzealous because of the president's violent rhetoric? Is it possible that some officers misinterpret the president's violent rhetoric?\r\n  Do we have data on the incidence rate of police killings during the president's term in Davao? How did it compare to other areas?\r\n  If relatives of those killed suspect foul play, who can they turn to? Most of them will be poor with limited resources, do we need to provide them legal assistance?\r\n\r\nSuspects killed while in custody (mainly \"nang-agaw ng baril\"):\r\n\r\n  How many suspects have been killed while in custody (compared with arrests)? How does this rate compare with previous years and administrations?\r\n  What is the protocol or procedure for officers handling suspects in custody? Are there any procedures to prevent the suspect being able to grab officers' weapons? Are all officers given the proper training re: these rules?\r\n  What is the protocol/procedure when a suspect is killed  in custody? Is there any automatic investigation or counseling for the officer involved?\r\n  Are the involved officers under any sort of administrative or criminal liability for carelessness in such situations?\r\n  Do we have data on the incidence rate of suspects killed in custody during the president's term in Davao? How did it compare to other areas?\r\n\r\nNon-suspects killed during any sort of police operations (\"collateral damage\"):\r\n\r\n  Are there any such incidents?\r\n  In case there are such incidents, are the involved officers under any sort of administrative or criminal liability? Is there any automatic investigation or counseling for the officers involved?\r\n\r\nVigilante killings (\"cardboard killings\" and riding-in-tandem killings):\r\n\r\n  How many such incidents have been recorded and are under investigation by the police?\r\n  What are the statuses of these investigations? What priority is given by to these cases?\r\n  What is the protocol/procedure when a body is found under such circumstances?\r\n  Are police able to identify all the victims? Why or why not?\r\n  Is there any kind of autopsy or forensic analysis done on the victims' bodies?\r\n  Many of the victims are alleged to be drug users or pushers, have the bodies been tested to check the truth of this?\r\n  How many of the victims were on police watchlists?\r\n  Where are the victims killed? What weapons are used? What materials are used for the cardboard/tape/etc? What model and make of vehicle/motorcycle are often used?\r\n  Which areas have the highest rate of such incidents? Do they correspond to areas with high drug use? Has there been any initiative to increase police visibility in those areas?\r\n  Is there any common pattern or modus operandi identified in such killings?\r\n  Are there any leads? (Understandably, the police may not be able to disclose this, or maybe only in executive session)\r\n  Do the killings bear any similarity to any previous cases?\r\n  Is it possible that there are law enforcers involved in these killings?\r\n  Do we have any intel or watchlists for hitmen the same way we do for drug dealers?\r\n  Do we have data on the incidence rate of vigilante killings during the president's term in Davao? How did it compare to other areas? Were the police able to find ways to reduce or solve those killings?\r\n\r\nBonus: Bilibid drug operations (in addition to whatever narrative the DOJ secretary felt like bringing forward):\r\n\r\n  What % of drug volume in the country passes through Bilibid? Where does this data come from? How does it compare to previous years and administrations?\r\n  How many inmates are involved in illegal activities inside Bilibid?\r\n  What is the daily routine of the involved inmates?\r\n  What are the existing legal procedures/protocols for inmates caught in illegal activities inside the Bilibid? Are we allowed to isolate or transfer the problematic inmates?\r\n  Which/how many Bilibid officers and guards are aware of the illegal activities?\r\n  How long have these illegal operations been going on? Are they still going on?\r\n  Where do the inmates get the money to fund these activities or to allegedly give to the former secretary as payoffs?\r\n\r\nFinal disclaimer: This is simply a thought exercise on my part, as to what guide questions I would start asking if I were in search of the truth. I have no expectations that any of the people in authority would actually follow these lines of questioning. I'm also sure there are many other pertinent questions that I have not considered at this time, but basically my approach would center around: what is the data, where does it come from, how does it compare to other data? And what are the procedures, who is liable for any problems, what is the progress of investigations? These avenues would seem to me (as a layman) to be the most useful in terms of improvements to legislation",

They're not wrong. I once spun a tall tale about a childhood rival I had visited in the province who challenged me to a swimming contest to explain why I had lost my glasses to the sea. The lie was so good, I got a follow-up question about it a year later and was so surprised I just blurted out that my rival died in accident before finally admitting to the fib\r\n\r\nBut I will intentionally lie often only for fun or mischief, or in the rare case, to protect someone or avoid some problem or injustice. Even for that last scenario I will try to avoid it as much as possible. I am more likely to stay quiet or avoid discussion or maybe even stretch the truth a bit to \"technically correct\", but I try to avoid any outright falsehoods unless absolutely necessary\r\n\r\nFor this same reason, I kind of have the same aversion to any form of salesmanship, although I am occasionally told that I am good at writing copy. At work I was sometimes asked to write some response to questions in a tender that would be less than honest.\r\n\r\n \"We don't have this feature, how should I respond?\"\r\n \r\n \"Just say we have it.\"\r\n \r\n \"But we don't. How about I just write that this feature will be available?\"\r\n\r\nYou can see the use of optimistic future tense to stretch the truth a bit. At one point a higher-up even told me that all the other suppliers do that to, as if that justifies it. Being asked to outright be dishonest was stressful for me at best so I later on learned to avoid such tasks altogether.\r\n\r\nI understand that not all salesmanship is dishonest and that not all salesmen are scammers looking to sell snake oil. But we basically live in a world that is caveat emptor don't we? I feel like those salesmen who are honestly just extolling the virtues of their wares are the exception rather than the norm.\r\n\r\nI recognize the need for salesmanship as a skill in everyday life, although younger me would have scoffed at that idea, believing that things should be judged solely on their merits. But merits aren't always obvious, and you still need some level of presentation and good communication skills to push your ideas and merits forward.  I'm fine with that I guess, as long as we try to keep things honest.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://waitbutwhy.com/table/when-is-it-okay-to-lie\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/lying.jpg\r",

Every time you add a new person to the team, he comes with a lot of overhead such as the need to learn the project details, responsibilities of other team members, who to consult when there's trouble, custom project procedures, and so on\r\n\r\nIt's a reinforcing cycle too. As overhead increases, the team imposes more processes and restrictions to make sure everyone is doing the right thing and there are no screw-ups. More processes means even greater overhead when new team members join. And the cycle repeats\r\n\r\nAs team size increases, mistakes become more costly too. When you're a team of two or three developers all in the same room, you can barrel ahead quickly and when there's a problem you can quickly figure out who broke the build. But when there's like eighty of you split over two floors, it becomes a tedious exercise. And every broken build and every critical bug now costs a lot more man-hours because it affects a lot more people. So everybody needs to be even more careful, and yeap even more overhead. You end up introducing more coordinators, reviewers, etc.\r\n\r\nIn so many words, the above is simply a restatement of the famous \"Mythical man-month\" quote:\r\n\r\n Adding more people to a late project makes it even later\r\n\r\nIn practice though, I find that people who are aware of this quote find themselves falling into the trap of \"this won't happen to me\", so a more nuanced discussion of the problems of scale might need to be had. Management typically responds more to qualitative costs, so maybe there are some metrics that you team could find? Something like \"for every N developers, we need an additional X amount of coordination work\" and so on\r\n\r\nOr maybe it's one of those myths we are doomed to relive again and again...",

Sure, there are projects and companies that don't need it, but those feel like the exception rather than the norm\r\n\r\nOvertime in software development is a natural consequence of schedule pressure and the fact that estimation is hard, which is why it's understandably common, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't try to avoid it\r\n\r\nMore than once I've been in a situation where the team stays overnight to try to get a build or release ready for the next day only to run out of time and have to delay the deployment anyway. You have to be willing to cut your losses and quit early, and just come back and finish the work the next day, when your productivity isn't shot by tiredness and the general crankiness of the long hours. When the whole team is still in the office at 3AM waiting for new builds, every delay or new defect is met with a drop of morale and increase in grumpiness, no matter how small\r\n\r\nStaying too late quickly hits a point of diminishing returns too. For one thing, working too many hours leads to poor quality and sloppy work. Ted Mosby famously said \"Nothing good ever happens after 2AM\", that's mostly true for software development too. More than once I've gone to work the next day and saw how I screwed up something the night before. Mistakes made during toxic overtime affect the next build too, and the one after that, and those problems cascade into more overtime. They all compound in one vicious cycle. It's better to just do the work in the morning when you have a clearer head to hopefully not continue the cycle\r\n\r\nThose are just the productivity and quality downsides -- there's also the problem of high overtime levels leading to increased absenteeism, lower health levels, and higher turnover rates\r\n\r\nThe realities of business and schedules and deadlines don't always let us avoid overtime, but hopefully every time we're forced to do so, we learn from those instances and figure out how to plan better next time (or to get the client's understanding to be more flexible with scope and schedule)\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2016/09/the-no-1-problem-in-software-projects/\r",

I was reminded of this recently because a loved one with an even lower pain tolerance than I did recently had to undergo a similar procedure\r\n\r\nI have a pretty low tolerance for pain myself. I tried to spin it a bit positively in the blog post linked above, but there's no question many times during the procedure I felt miserable and in lots of pain. Even just the process of being put on a dextrose was pretty uncomfortable for me, and laying there on the operating table hunched in a fetal position waiting to be administered spinal anesthesia was far worse. I even had to undergo anesthesia twice because I went back into the OR after some complications!\r\n\r\nAs I've written before, one of the worst things is the mental anticipation of pain. Those few moments waiting for the inevitable pinprick that will start an avalanche of pain. There's a balance you have to strike between bracing yourself for the pain that you know is coming and not letting your fear of the coming pain somehow amplify it\r\n\r\nFor things like spinal anesthesia, or dextrose being hooked up, or blood samples being taken from your arm, you just have to pretty much grin and bear it. If you can't avoid these scenarios you might as well just get through with it as quickly as possible. That's why for medical problems, I prefer just doing what needs to be done, even if it means some measure of pain and discomfort. It's better than letting discomfort linger and possibly reoccur and become more complicated\r\n\r\nPrior to that operation, the most pain I've experienced was a toothache back in 2004. (Apparently I write about pain a lot). Toothaches are also pretty bad because unlike the pinpricks described above, they're continuous pain. I only wanted to mention this part because I remembered that my dentist happened to read the blog post linked in this paragraph and gave me a frowny face over email when she read about me complaining of the pain haha\r\n\r\nI look forward to the day that medical science advances quickly enough that pain relief is fast, easy, and painless, though that may take a while: apparently we don't even completely understand how anesthesia works, we're just glad that it does. Until then, we just grit our teeth and think happy thoughts and power through the pain\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2010/11/randomly-amazed/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/2005/12/the-left-half-of-my-mouth-is-numb-thanks/\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/2004/12/i-get-bored-easily/\r",

On any given day if you needed to work overtime or run errands, you're probably saying goodbye to any recreation time on that day. And if you have kids to take care of, that's basically all days\r\n\r\nThese days I've found that even if you're not working most days, it's easy enough to feel like there's not enough time for all the things you want to do. Or maybe that's just me because there's a whole lot of things I want to be able to do. I want to be able to learn, read, write, watch, draw, create, play, work on my side projects, argue with people on the internet, and so on. I don't understand people who say they have too much free time and they get bored, I feel like those people just don't have enough things they want to do. The difference between work and leisure is that when you're  at work, you look for enough tasks to fill your required hours, while for leisure you like for enough hours to do the things you want to do\r\n\r\nEver since I started working I always had this idea that it was a ridiculous notion that we had to give up so much of our time to work so that in theory we could be comfortable in some foggy unknown future. You shouldn't sacrifice today to enjoy tomorrow, what's the point? Your hour today is the same amount of time as your hour tomorrow. I get that sometimes you have to sacrifice some time today for some sort of multiplicative effect it may theoretically have on the future (i.e. doing something today for 1 hour may earn you multiple hours in the future), but you shouldn't sacrifice so much that you are no longer able to enjoy and appreciate the present (if you have that luxury of course)\r\n\r\nWe get the same amount of time (24 hours) every day as everyone else though. That's the same amount of time as Einstein or Bill Gates or Barack Obama or whatever other random successful person you want to cite. It's the ultimate equalizer. Other people accomplish so much with the same amount of time, so why can't we?\r\n\r\nSupposedly it's all about setting your priorities and focusing on what's important. Unfortunately focus has always been a problem of mine since I like to dabble in a wide variety of things. I look at the list of things I want to do and I tell myself I have to decide to sacrifice some of these so that the others can get done. Focus only on what matters. What if everything matters?\r\n\r\nPeople will say you should cut back on TV or playing video games if you want to get stuff done, that these things are a waste of time. But as John Lennon said \"Time you enjoy wasting is not wasted time\". If doing these things is what you want to do, you should go for it, just be aware of what you're sacrificing in exchange\r\n\r\nI believe that some time within this century attitudes of people towards work and time will begin to change. That the idea of working 40-50 hour days being a normal thing will start to fade away. (Or maybe I am being too optimistic). Until that time comes, we all need to consciously manage our time and priorities in order to cope",

So often there will be people who don't like to speak up when they think something is wrong, either just tolerating it or hoping someone else will take it up. A software dev in another company once told me that he felt like he was complaining so much that he was looking like a bad guy\r\n\r\nThis is of course, a bad attitude to have. If no one speaks up about the problems we see, how would we ever improve? Someone has to do it, it might as well be you. And often there will be benefits too to speaking up, for one thing you might get credit for raising something no one else has thought of. As they say, the squeaky wheel gets the grease\r\n\r\nThat being said, you should of course pick your battles. Don't complain too much about the little things, but be sure to raise your voice when there's an important battle to be fought. This will give you a reputation such that when you do raise something, people will pay attention. Having a balanced approach is a lot more helpful than complaining about every little thing\r\n\r\nOh, and of course if someone is doing something wrong, try not to be combative but be a bit diplomatic. You don't want to offend anyone, you just want to do things the right way. And question the action instead of the person so that it doesn't feel like a personal attack. \"Hey, is that really how it should be done?\" will be received better than \"That's not how to do it, you idiot!\"\r\n\r\nDon't be afraid to be unreasonable every so often. As George Bernard Shaw famously said \"The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man.\"",

Software estimation is already difficult, there is no need to make it harder by pressuring developers to reduce their estimates just to be able to fit your project into a gantt chart. Such practices will only increase the risks the project faces AND make it less likely for the developers to give you good estimates in the future\r\n  Adding more people to a software project in order to catch up to a rapidly approaching schedule, popularly known as \"The Mythical Man-Month\" after the Brooks book of the same name. Every person you add to a team will increase communication and management overhead such that it is almost certainly not worth it. In order to catch up when falling behind, you have to reduce overhead, not increase it\r\n\r\nManaging schedule pressure means understanding the limitations of what is and isn't possible. We try to estimate better to better inform our planning. We add buffers where we can to absorb some of the pressure. We manage client expectations so they don't pressure us too much. We try to learn from our mistakes so that future projects have less mistakes and therefore less pressure. And we have to be willing to say \"this is impossible to do in the timeframe you want\" to the stakeholders pressuring us\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2016/08/the-secrets-to-perfect-estimates\r",

The silly part is requiring a particular implementation (HashMap) instead of the generic interface (Map). It unnecessarily restricts your API and makes it less flexible. Unless your function specifically cares about the hashing part, there's no reason the parameter isn't a Map instead\r\n\r\nSince most Java libraries will perform proper encapsulation and give you a generic Map type, it adds some mismatch when you have to plug one of those types into your function; one would need to instantiate a new HashMap and copy the contents of the generic Map into it so that your function accepts it\r\n\r\nUse the generic interface as much as possible! Use the specific implementation type only when instantiating!",

Having just finished binge-watching the entire run of Star Trek Voyager, I immediately thought that was the sort of AI advancement that could lead to such things as Voyager's Emergency Medical Hologram, an AI which could replace a human doctor. Of course, it is still very unlikely for this to happen anytime soon, medicine is a very complex field and new things are still being discovered all the time. This sort of approach -- using a set of data (in this case, the patient's genetic data) could be compared to an existing database of past diagnoses to find something similar -- could advance rapidly in the coming years to at least assist human doctors in providing diagnoses for those rare conditions that only few doctors have encountered. It may take a generation or so, but I can see that AI medical assistants might at least be possible in the future\r\n\r\nI got to thinking: is my own profession (software development) in danger of being replaced by AI in some far-off future? \"Software that can write software\" is an ideal that many programmers have thought about at some point in their careers. I remember that at some point a few years into my career I was already thinking about how it might be possible. But then there was also a project where I had to study the possibility of writing software to convert legacy PowerBuilder code into Java web application, which led to a far greater appreciation of how complicated programming languages are and an understanding that any attempt to generate large systems automatically is a crazy endeavor that would take a large amount of time.\r\n\r\nIndividual small software tasks can be easily automated -- this is why we have code templates and code generators and so on. This kind of work is similar to the medical situation above, it's based on knowledge of existing code, so a program can put something together based on previous implementations. But as I mentioned in a previous post, writing software is about finding the right arrangement of code, which is largely a creative effort and is much more difficult for software to do, at least until the automation of the lower-level smaller-scale tasks is perfected.\r\n\r\nWhile I believe new tools will be developed within the near future to automate small parts of the coding process, the overall development of software systems is likely to remain out of reach of AI for a long while. In fact, I believe that software development will be one of the very last fields to be replaced completely by robots, since as other fields start getting more and more automated, there will be a greater need for new software to cover those domains. So most probably doctors and programmers don't have anything to worry about for quite a while\r\n\r\n [1]: http://siliconangle.com/blog/2016/08/05/watson-correctly-diagnoses-woman-after-doctors-were-stumped/\r",

Why is this to be considered a great virtue for a programmer? Programming is at least partly an act of creation, which means there is an element of craftsmanship involved. A craftsman imbued with hubris is able to take pride in his work -- he is driven to create work that is the best quality he can provide. For a programmer, this quality reflects both externally (low number of defects) and internally (code that is easy to read and maintain)\r\n\r\nThere are also programmers who do not see themselves as craftsmen, but rather simply code-generating cogs in a machine. They are not imbued with hubris, and hence have no concern with the quality of their work. Their only concern is to be able to do the bare minimum to satisfy the requirements of their tasks. And if you that is the way you choose to live and work, that can be fine for many people\r\n\r\nIn general however, I find that programmers who are able to take pride in their work are more able to go the extra mile. They will tend to be more productive, they will be more able to think outside the box, they will be more able to provide suggestions for improvement, they will be more willing and able to help and support other programmers, and so on\r\n\r\nThis ability to take pride in one's work applies at the company level too. There are companies that don't like to focus on quality or standards or doing things right. When your company decides that quality is not that important and sacrifices it at the altar of profits, it reflects poorly upon the craftsmen in your company and affects their happiness and morale. No craftsman will be happy being pressured to do substantial work simply because the company is unwilling to manage schedules properly.\r\n\r\nIf you are a leader in a company who has developed a culture of quality and craftsmanship, think long and hard before pivoting to any direction that takes away from that culture. There are people who stay at a company simply because they enjoy being craftsmen able to do high-quality work. If you take that away, well, you can imagine the consequences",

I have a bit of a reputation myself for preferring to speak frankly and directly instead of dancing around the issues, although these days I understand the wisdom of adapting to the situation as needed\r\n\r\nIn my youth I was the sort of person who disdained those who prioritized form over substance. For this reason I disliked protocol and ritual and dress codes and formalities and all that. I imagine that IT people are notorious for preferring casual dress and disliking suits. I proudly enjoyed games with dated graphics when other people would fawn over the latest Crysis or whatever. I felt that anyone who prioritized appearances was somehow shallow and that one should focus more on the functional and practical. This is somewhat related to my views on lying and salesmanship\r\n\r\nAs I got older though, I began to appreciate that sometimes appearances can matter too. Formalities and rituals can have meaning, especially when other people value them. And sometimes you have to dress up, either to impress people, or to fit in with the situation. These are concessions one has to make in order to be member of society. As Sheldon Cooper would say, \"it's the social convention\". I guess I consider learning to navigate society's social conventions is part of being a mature adult\r\n\r\nWhich is part of why the current leadership's lack of diplomacy is so annoying for me personally. It smacks of immaturity. Reacting to criticism with cussing and swearing and dredging up century-old mistakes and calling other people gay, these are behaviors I'd (sadly) expect from a 10 year old on XBox Live, not the leader of a sovereign nation.\r\n\r\nAnd supporters will say at least he's honest and direct and real. I'm pretty sure I'm honest and direct and real (ask anyone!) and I don't go around swearing at people just because they point out my faults. There's no reason to antagonize people just because they don't agree with you. It's possible to disagree and still be diplomatic. Not even the leadership of North Korea talks like that. Well, I could talk my head off politics if given the chance, so I'll just abruptly end this post here\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2016/09/lying-and-salesmanship/\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Karina on 2016-10-04 14:02:39 +0000\r\n\"There’s no reason to antagonize people just because they agree with you. \"\r\n\r\nI think you meant *don't agree with you.

Framework coding is a bit different from the actual application development. At the core it's a simple idea: you have a whole bunch of code that helps do programming tasks that you expect will often be necessary in a certain set of projects, so you write that code with the intent of reusing it across multiple projects. For a web development framework, those tasks will be things like handling request parameters, form validation, form to database mapping, and so on. You can have frameworks for a variety of domains too, not just web development. There are mobile development frameworks, and game development frameworks, and so on\r\n\r\nTypically, a framework is developed alongside a project using that framework (to save on costs), but the framework's objective of code reuse may not always align with the project's objectives of \"get stuff done already\".  Investing in reusable code often means there will be a bit more work done as you start up, to make sure that the code is flexible and reusable enough for future projects, but when your schedules are tight, these concerns may become secondary and you will be tempted to write in some substandard code that you will \"just refactor later\". Technical debt by itself already tends to be a problem, it gets worse when it's technical debt in framework code since you're going to carry that across multiple projects, so be wary when sacrificing the quality of framework code for the sake of one project\r\n\r\nAnother thing is that you need to be more aware of separation of concerns, especially if the application development team overlaps with the framework development team. The idea of a framework is that it should be handling the most common tasks in a typical project, but when you're embedded in a project there will be a tendency to try to handle even those special cases that are unique to the project. The danger here is that parts of the project domain will start seeping into your framework code because of requests by devs to provide a way to handle so-and-so scenario. And you end up with a situation where a few years later you ask, what the hell is this code doing, and the answer is that it was something needed by a developer three projects ago\r\n\r\nSpeaking of separation of concerns, I've also found that devs working on framework code need to be more cognizant of things like that, meaning they have to be able to write good, modular, flexible code that can be easily reused for future projects. That means you need a solid understanding of coupling, separation of concerns, interfaces, and so on\r\n\r\nFlexibility is particularly important, as I've found in one of my later projects that was sold to multiple clients. Different clients will have varying needs and wants, so making sure your code is flexible and configurable enough to cater to a wide variety of needs. When you're writing framework code, your clients are other developers, all the more reason to present an API that is consistent and flexible enough for their use. If you expect your framework to be used as the baseline for multiple projects, you will need to make sure it can cater to a wide variety of projects\r\n\r\nThat flexibility will have limits though. Frameworks will tend to require a \"certain way of doing things\", meaning devs will have to do some adapting to be able to use it. For example, if you post about an out of the box approach on a Ruby on Rails forum, you might get some replies about how \"that's not how things are done in Rails\". In practice, it's impossible for a framework's maintainers to anticipate all possible future needs of different projects, and developers will need to be able to build on top of your framework or even extend it as necessary. Instead of wasting effort trying to anticipate everything, framework developers should provide an easy, default path for the most common things, but be flexible enough to allow divergence for things the framework doesn't support\r\n\r\nAnother thing to pay attention to is how tightly coupled different components of your framework are. Is the framework still useful if you have to support a third-party component to replace some functionality later on? What if you need to use a different database vendor? What if the client requires a different way of storing resource strings? You don't have to support all the different possible implementations up front, but it would be wise to leave room for a future extension or plug-in to be easily swappable with the framework's components\r\n\r\nThe most important thing to keep in mind is that the objectives of a framework are two-fold: (a) be reusable across multiple projects; (b) make it easier for developers to do the most common tasks in the chosen domain. Anything else beyond that, tread carefully",

To name a few: I've been doing daily sketches, I've been going on a daily walking routine, learning Spanish on Duolingo, I have a quick stretching/exercise routine I do in the mornings, etc. (I'm also supposed to be writing daily, but this has proven more difficult to keep doing consistently... )\r\n\r\nI like those daily habits that can be easily tracked with technology. Duolingo tracks my Spanish learning streak (currently on a 147-day streak). r/sketchdaily tracks my drawing streaks. I have an app on my phone that tracks how often I meet my daily walking target (usually the only problem is if it rains)\r\n\r\nThere's a productivity tip supposedly advocated by Jerry Seinfeld called \"Don't Break the Chain\". It recognizes the power of tracking your streaks. The longer your streak gets, the more it motivates (or pressures?) you to maintain the streak and keep it going. It also helps you realize that doing things repeatedly on a daily basis leads to small, incremental improvements that can quickly compound into big improvements\r\n\r\nDaily habits can be difficult sometimes unless you live a totally boring life. Most people will have differing circumstances from day-to-day that may cause you to miss your daily habits every so often. Maybe you have an out-of-town trip that makes your daily gym habit impossible, or maybe you needed to go overtime all week so you needed to skip your extra learnings, and so on. That's kind of fine -- as long as you understand the tradeoffs you're making (it is your life to live and prioritize after all)\r\n\r\nBut even when you're short on time, you can still look for ways to keep your streak going. With Duolingo, I usually do it in the mornings on my desktop pc, but if I'm busy all day I can do a quick Duolingo session on my mobile. For sketches, if I don't have much time I can pick up a small post-it and do a quick and small doodle. If it's raining too hard for me to go out and take my walk, I can go to the nearest mall and just do a walkabout there, maybe even running some errands at the same time. I'm also supposed to be reading books daily -- one of the daily habits I'm not consistent at -- but if I don't have time, maybe I can just read a few paragraphs or pages right before I sleep\r\n\r\nDepending on your personality, trying to maintain a streak can seem to be a burden sometimes. You feel like you're becoming a slave to the habit. But as the book \"The Greatest Salesman in the World\" implies, humans by nature are slaves to habit, and if we must be slaves to habit we might as well be slaves to good habits of our own choosing\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2016/03/sketching-daily/\r\n [2]: https://www.duolingo.com/\r\n [3]: http://reddit.com/r/sketchdaily\r",

Composition provides greater flexibility, modularity, and extensibility in large software systems as compared to inheritance, especially for statically typed languages like Java that don't support multiple inheritance\r\n\r\nThe most common examples of the problems caused by too much inheritance involved generic object such as the game objects example in the wikipedia page linked above. I want to cite a more enterprise-y example I've encountered in past projects\r\n\r\nLet's say in your system, you have a base class \"ScreenController\", which contains all the common behaviors for screens in your system. Behaviors could include startup behaviors, variables the screen needs to track, how to handle the actions when the user clicks buttons, that sort of thing. Then each dev working on a different screen in your system will just extend this base class for their own screen, and you have a type hierarchy that looks something like this:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1506\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fcoi1.png\" alt=\"fcoi1\" width=\"188\" height=\"118\" /\r\n\r\nAlright, that's fine, a perfectly acceptable use of inheritance. But then as your system grows larger, you notice some of the screens share some other behaviors could be refactored so that they aren't repeated. For example, some of the screens might be Search screens that have similar behavior. Or maintenance (CRUD) screens that share common action handlers. Using inheritance, you might extend ScreenController and add additional hierarchy levels to handle those common behaviors, and you end up with something like:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1507\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fcoi2.png\" alt=\"fcoi2\" width=\"234\" height=\"214\" /\r\n\r\nOkay, it's a bit more complicated now, but it's probably still manageable right? But then one of the devs realizes that your project needs some modal screens too, which have some additional behavior as well. An example would be a modal screen that allows the user to select some parameters (a \"selection screen\"). Some modal screens also need to be search screens or maintenance screens too. If you insist on using inheritance, you need to mix and match all the possible combinations and might start seeing a hierarchy similar to:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1508\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fcoi3.png\" alt=\"fcoi3\" width=\"269\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fcoi3.png 269w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fcoi3-206x300.png 206w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 269px) 100vw, 269px\" /\r\n\r\nOkay, things are starting to get really unwieldy now, but hopefully there aren't any further complications right? Then your team starts to implement multiple subsystems with different domains, and some of the different domains have common behavior that they want to have in base classes too. So for example, the finance domain wants to have a FinanceScreen parent class they can use. But what about the existing hierarchy above? Should you duplicate it for each domain and up with ridiculous things like FinanceModalSearchScreen? I'm not even going to bother making an example of such a type hierarchy!\r\n\r\nNow, you look at this mess and wonder how could it have been done better? Well, (as if the spoilers in the post title didn't make this obvious), one alternative would have been to use composition. Composition means creating objects to encapsulate behavior and attaching them to other objects as necessary.\r\n\r\nIn our example, if you still had the flat hierarchy from the start, you could have a base ScreenBehavior class, and the ScreenController could have an addBehavior() method. Your class hierarchy would end up similar to:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1510\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fcoi4.png\" alt=\"fcoi4\" width=\"465\" height=\"201\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fcoi4.png 465w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fcoi4-300x130.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 465px) 100vw, 465px\" /\r\n\r\nAnd each screen will just have to add the specific behaviors it needs like so:\r\n\r\n    \r\n    public ScreenA() {\r\n    \t\taddBehavior(new SearchScreenBehavior());\r\n    \t\taddBehavior(new ModalScreenBehavior());\r\n    \t\taddBehavior(new FinanceScreenBehavior());\r\n    \t}\r\n    \r\n\r\nThis setup is a lot more flexible and easily extensible, since you don't have to uproot entire type hierarchies when some new common behavior needs to be added. Such robust design is especially important for larger projects and systems that may have hundreds of screens. The only downside is that you have to implement support for this approach early in the project -- the longer you wait, the more complicated it becomes to adjust the existing code to the new paradigm. Definitely something to consider if you're a technical lead on a large project just starting out\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositionoverinheritance\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fcoi1.png\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fcoi2.png\r\n [4]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/fcoi3.png\r",

One of the purpose of writing and introspection is to become more attuned to your inner thoughts and emotions, to better understand and work with your own self. I try to have this self-awareness that I'm sure not many people bother with\r\n\r\nJust yesterday, a friend asked me why I tracked a certain thing that I do. I told him that I track a lot of things because memory is poor and fragile. I track the restaurants I go to, the shows I watch, the books I read, the games I play, the things I spend money on, how much I sleep, etc. Maybe I should add \"how I feel\" to that list too\r\n\r\nIntrospection and self-awareness is a fine line to walk. You don't want to be so absorbed in yourself that you get bogged down in overthinking. Yet everyone needs some level of self-awareness in their life -- if only to be able to identify when their own prejudices, fears, or other emotions are starting to affect daily decisions",

It's presumptuous at best and actively damaging to schedule and morale at worst. We already know estimation is hard, there is no need to make it more complicated by automatically assuming the best-case scenario (or in many cases, an impossible scenario)\r\n\r\nThe problem is that it's a jedi mind trick that can easily work on the weak-willed. It's a bad form of programmer hubris coming into play: Newbie or junior devs looking for a chance to prove themselves enthusiastically say something ridiculous along the lines of \"oh sure, i'll just need to floobify the crominator function a bit, should be easy\", and the crafty manager gleefully ticks off that part of the schedule as \"on track\"\r\n\r\nBetter managers will instead ask the question \"How long will this take?\" And if the reply feels like an unusually low or high amount of effort, the manager will follow-up with a clarification as needed. \"Really? I thought it was a simple UI change?\" or \"Really? I thought it would be more complicated because we have 12 such screens right?\" The intent of such clarification should be to elicit more information and not to pressure the dev into giving a more \"desirable\" estimate. Eliciting information also helps to find any differences in understanding which may be affecting the estimate. If the estimate is still unsatisfactory after clarification, the manager can ask the dev to study it further or get a second opinion as needed\r\n\r\nAnd if the dev is unable to give an estimate immediately, the manager should avoid pressuring him to do so, instead giving him some time to study the problem more thoroughly. \"Can you get back to me with something rough, say by tomorrow morning?\"\r\n\r\nUnderstandably, clients and managers have this pressure of trying to fit all the work within a chosen schedule. But such should be anchored in reality and not reliant on pressuring devs to say that their work is easy\r\n\r",

I'm sure it's a very common thing. I'll often have random ideas for projects I could do, big or small. I'd have a dozen of them percolating in my head at any one time. And somewhere between four to five dozen scattered down in various documents, notepads and what not, waiting to be explored. (I literally have two such small post-it notes with 5 such items in front of me right now)\r\n\r\nThese projects range from the small (programming: small scripts to automate some stuff I do regularly; sketches: quick sketches I want to do; writing: blog posts, short stories;) to the rather large and time-consuming (game development ideas, complicated data analysis ideas, novel ideas, some major reorganization/sorting of stuff, and so on). Unfortunately, starting new projects is rarely fruitful unless you actually finish those projects. And I rarely finish the larger projects.\r\n\r\nI think about what it takes for me to get one of the largest projects to completion. At which stages do I typically falter?\r\n\r\nTypically it starts with an idea. Something cool I could do. Or make. Or write. At this stage there's a lot of optimism. I'm probably in love with the idea. If it's a big enough idea, I might even think it'll make me famous. Or earn me a lot of money. Or win me a nobel prize. Or all of those!\r\n\r\nIf I don't like the idea enough to start on it immediately, I'll add it to one of my lists that hopefully I manage to get back to sometime within the next century.\r\n\r\nIf I do like the idea enough, I'll move on to some form of brainstorming. Maybe I'll let the idea run around in my head for a couple of nights. Typically I'll run the idea through some people I trust and would have a similar interest in the area. Then maybe draw up a short idea document outlining some of the details I've already imagined, to be expanded or reduced later as needed. If it's a writing thing, I start to think in broad strokes: what the setting is, who the protag is, where I imagine him to be ending etc\r\n\r\nAt this point I pretty much have an idea of what I want to do. The next step is to study what I need to execute. If it's a programming or game development project, I look into what tools I'll need or programming techniques I need to learn. I might need to access or scrape some sort of data source for analysis so I'll start looking for sources\r\n\r\nThen I would try to get started. For programming stuff I might make a small prototype already. If it's a writing thing, I might write a scene or two.\r\n\r\nAfter the first tranche of work, I'm going to assess how much farther I need to go. And typically this is where many of the projects will drop off. At this point I become aware of the size and scope of what I plan to do. I would look at the sheer amount of work needed to bring the project to conclusion, and it can be disheartening.\r\n\r\nI start out optimistic, thinking about the exciting, cool stuff I get to try out, amazing scenes I want to write, interesting gameplay mechanics I thought of, and so on. But once I get past that I start to realize that finishing the job will require a lot of drudgework too. That means a lot of small, annoying, menial tasks that I'll put off and won't want to do\r\n\r\nI read a lot of self-improvement and \"getting things done\" sort of stuff, so I know all the usual advice: break down the big tasks into small tasks, take one step at a time, and so on. The problem is usually lack of focus. Since at this point there's a lull in my interest towards the project, it's an opportune time for some other idea to come along and distract me. Or maybe some shiny new video game or book starts taking up my time. Or some other random distraction that takes my time away. Then I'm too lazy to pick it up again, and the vicious cycle repeats with the next big project.\r\n\r\nSmaller projects are fine -- the ones that only take me a few hours or a day to do. It's the bigger ones that are the problem. I mostly know where I have to improve -- I have to be able to focus and commit my time. Eliminate distractions. Stay on track. And so on. Someday I'll get it right\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

Bad news and bad events have no master or timing, they do not consider giving us a break, they come and go as they please no matter how bad the situation already is.\r\n\r\nI fully understand why many people choose to withdraw from daily news or shut it out altogether or even just avoid social media completely. Hearing the bad news can be disheartening, and it comes at us even when there is work to be done or words to be written or deadlines to be met. We have no choice but to soldier on, to slog through the bad news and do our work anyway. It is the world we live in.\r\n\r\nTo withdraw from this world and hide away from all the darkness is understandable, if only for a short time. But all the bad things in the world won't go away simply because we refuse to see them. At some point we have to come back to it and voice our objections and engage in discussion and reach out to other people and ask what we can do to help turn the tide. It is not a burden we simply leave other people to bear, it is on our shoulders collectively to try to make the world a better place, if only a little bit at a time, if only by saying \"I don't think these things are good, and here's why\"\r\n\r\nThe world doesn't stop for us because it makes us sad.

The developer working on it found that the problem only appears when the record ID was 12. When it was 11 or less, everything was fine. When it was 13 or more, everything was also fine. After some investigation, it was found that there was some code that executed with a condition of \"if record id == 12\", which was already a WTF. It turns out that some behavior had been hardcoded for a previous demo to a client and was never reverted and made it all the way into acceptance testing builds.\r\n\r\nPrototyping and demo builds are great tools and all, but I've observed a dangerous tendency for upper management to afterwards say \"we already have the code right? So we just deploy it\", or something to that effect. The urge to save on development costs is understandable, but the developers who built the prototype have a responsibility to raise any risks due to poor code or hacks or workarounds or some sort of hardcoded shenanigans to make sure they are properly addressed before the code gets deployed anywhere serious. Many of these shenanigans tend to be found in prototypes or demo codes that were developed in a short timeframe to hit a particular demo date.\r\n\r\nAbove all, the team should be more than willing to decide if there is no way the demo codebase is good enough to be rolled out to an actual client and be willing to say no to such requests if needed.\r\n\r\n(Demoing functionality you don't really have yet is a separate matter entirely, one I don't approve of naturally)",

We had an entire subject dedicated to feedback loop controllers back in college. I enjoyed the topic so much I took the subject twice! An example of the use of feedback loops would be a thermostat that has a sensor to detect the current temperature. Once it senses the current temperature, it compares that with the target temperature and uses the difference in values to adjust the thermostat input. In this way, the temperature eventually reaches the target value\r\n\r\nHumans are also machines subject to feedback loops. We enjoy receiving positive feedback. The more feedback we receive about how well we are performing, the happier we are and the more we are able to perform well. This is part of why we enjoy getting paid a salary regularly -- some part of our brain treats money as a way to \"keep score\" and as feedback that hey, you're not doing so bad, here's some cash to keep you going!\r\n\r\nFeedback can be negative too, but the effect can vary based on the person's attitude. If you accept feedback and criticism of your work and use it to learn and move forward, then you can use even negative feedback as positive reinforcement. If you refuse to acknowledge legitimate negative feedback and instead take it personally or criticize the one giving feedback, then you are failing to learn from the feedback and it either becomes useless or in the worst case can even reinforce negative behavior\r\n\r\nQuicker feedback loops allow humans to iterate faster and determine which behavior is best to achieve his goals. My favorite example of feedback loops is in games. Computer and video games are very good at providing near-instant feedback. Run into an enemy? Okay that means you take damage, so that's not good. Finish a task? Ah, you gained some experience points, so it looks like that's good. And games will even tell you immediately how far you are from achieving your goal! How many experience points until I unlock a new ability? How much more damage can I take before I die?\r\n\r\nPeople enjoy this sort of instant feedback loops, so more and more systems are using some form of \"gamification\" to improve adoption and usage. Websites like stackoverflow grant you points for answering questions. Fitness trackers give you immediate feedback on how many calories you've lost. And so it goes\r\n\r\nThe downside of this instant feedback culture is that it becomes more difficult for us to appreciate things that have long feedback loops. And they are already difficult in the first place, since the feedback takes a long time to get back to you!\r\n\r\nMy favorite example of this is dieting. Dieting is hard mainly because you suffer regularly (due to having to eat food you don't like) but the effect isn't measurable immediately. It takes a while to notice any changes, so it takes more discipline to maintain the diet in the absence of that feedback.\r\n\r\nThis is why people have systems like calorie counting -- it provides an intermediate feedback to substitute for the feedback you don't have yet on how much weight you've lost or gained. But it's still an abstract concept and doesn't translate too easily into weight gained or lost. And also it can be difficult to track precisely since not everything you eat will have a calorie count available. I reckon that once we have an app where you just take pictures of the food you just ate it tells you how many pounds you gained or lost, a lot of people will be better at keeping to their diets\r\n\r\nI like to look at the activities I pursue regularly and see if there is anything I can measure to help provide feedback loops for self-improvement. This is why I enjoy daily habits that track streaks -- it's simple, instant feedback that tells me I accomplished something.\r\n\r\nOf course, humans are not machines that need to have perfect systems and be slaves to their feedback loops. So it's also okay to break your daily habits every so often or to cheat on your diet once a week or such, it is one of the privileges of being human. And breaking your patterns also provides some feedback which you can use later\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

Requirements are often only vague wishes that the client has, with no regard to the sheer number of instructions needed to implement those requirements. Throughout the entire process it's important to use feedback loops to determine whether development is on the right path. And like all feedback loops, their effectiveness often hinges on how quickly we are able to turn around and give and incorporate feedback into future iterations\r\n\r\nFeedback loops happen whenever someone gets to review something of course. Prototyping with the client is the most basic form of feedback loop. Building a quick prototype, then showing it to the client, seeing what works and what doesn't and what the clients wants to change, then iterating into the next prototype -- all of these reduce the risk that we are not building the correct thing in the first place. Similar feedback loops appear whenever someone reviews your design or your code or your documentation\r\n\r\nFor me personally, the more important feedback loop happens at the coding level. It is very rare for a dev to code to everything in a program (no matter what size) in one go. Instead, programs are almost always built incrementally, in a loop of code-build-test-back to coding again. Thus it is very important to make sure that this build is as tight and as optimized as possible\r\n\r\nOne of my major annoyances with working with Java and Eclipse over the past ten years is that even though Eclipse has that \"build automatically\" feature that should provide instant feedback, in practice there can be significant lag time while the application is built and for web applications, often your local server will need to be restarted to reflect the changes. Given how often devs iterate while coding, even a few seconds of lag time in each loop is already a minor annoyance. Build times of one minute or more will be deadly to productivity, often taking the dev out of the much-desired \"flow zone\". Thus you have to optimize this cycle as much as possible -- with Java/Eclipse/Tomcat, that meant disabling all unnecessary build validations, reducing your application size by removing redundant code and dependencies, and so on. Hardware optimizations are also an option -- I was really happy when the company finally decided to spend money on SSDs for the devs (money well spent)\r\n\r\nThis problem also happens in the bigger loop of devs coding - build deployment - verification by the testing team - send bugs/comments back to devs for fixing. Often the main bottleneck is the build deployment, so you want this process as fast as possible as well. I've been on projects where we had the misfortune to have the build process go as long as 2 hours at a time. After some optimization, we were able to trim it to around 30-40 minutes, but this is still pretty bad. During hard deadlines when you have to deliver something the next day, this loop can cycle many, many times, and long build times will be the difference between whether your team merely does a bit of overtime or have to stay until morning. Unfortunately it can be a difficult problem to address, and the fact that the problems only become urgent during the times of greatest schedule pressure does not help. I believe that once you have a large enough system and dev team, having people dedicated to maintaining and optimizing the build system quickly becomes a necessary evil",

For context, the elevators in the building were zoned programmatically -- this means that they only service a particular subset of the floors that are provided on the elevator panel itself. They sometimes disable the zoning depending on the loading among the elevator cars so simply removing the buttons for the unsupported floors isn't a viable solution.\r\n\r\nBack to that message: It's terrible. At least once a week, some clueless newcomer to the building would press the button and hear the message and totally be unable to relate it to what he just did or even understand what it was saying. (That the message audio did not have the best quality only compounded the problem.)\r\n\r\nSee, that error message doesn't make sense because it's telling you something you already see: when you press the button for an non-service floor, the button does not light up. It's the equivalent of submitting a web form and receiving an error message of \"Your form was not submitted.\"\r\n\r\nA good error message should do three things (none of which the elevator message do):\r\n\r\n  It should tell the user something went wrong.\r\n\r\nThe first one is easy and may immediately be made obvious by the nature of the error message itself. For a web platform, error messages are often displayed highlighted in a different colored font and with some sort of \"X\" or other icon indicating a mistake has been made. For the elevator message. For the elevator message, I've often observed that some people dismiss the verbal message as background noise unrelated to the button they just pressed, and some will even repeatedly press the button again, ignoring the message. An improvement would be to have some sort of high-pitched buzzing noise whenever the button for a non-service floor is pressed, before giving the verbal message. Pressing the button multiple times would reset to the buzzing noise, making it painfully obvious that \"Hey, maybe I should pay attention.\"\r\n\r\n  It should tell the user what went wrong.\r\n\r\nFor a web platform this typically means some of the fields failed some validation, in which case you should list them out. Something like \"The following problems were encountered: Name is a required field. Date must not be later than today. Amount must be greater than 0.\" and so on. One must also take care to use more plain language rather than technical, i.e. \"The Name must be filled in.\" might be better than \"Name is a required field.\"\r\n\r\nFor the elevator message, instead of describing what the user already sees when he presses the non-responsive button, more useful would have been a direct \"This elevator does not go to that floor.\"\r\n\r\n  It should tell the user what he can do to correct it.\r\n\r\nFor web forms with validation errors, a simple \"Please correct these errors and resubmit the form.\" should suffice. For the elevator message, it could simply say \"Please try a different elevator.\"\r\n\r\nGood error messages make a big difference in the usability of your product, be it a web form or an elevator or something else. It makes it easier for users to find and learn their own way forwards rather than needing someone to walk them through their actions.",

They will believe a lie because they want to believe it's true, or because they are afraid it might be true.\"\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean you're stupid or I'm stupid, just that collectively, we're kind of dumb. Put another way by another wise character in popular culture, from the film Men in Black:\r\n\r\n Kay: A person is smart. People are dumb, panicky dangerous animals and you know it.\r\n\r\nThis is what makes it so easy for demagogues from Hitler to McCarthy to Trump to certain local politicians to stir up support: create a boogeyman that people fear, and people will willingly believe your lies as long as you tell them what they want to hear (under the guise of \"telling it as it is\").\r\n\r\nThe thing is, a demagogue doesn't even have to be consistent in what he says: he can say one thing at first (\"our anti-crime drive is doing well, crime is down\") to project one image and a contradicting thing later on (\"There is a state of lawlessness, we should consider harsher methods.\") depending on how his goals change and what the particular audience wants to hear. It has the added benefit of making anyone who reports on it look bad and inciting conflict (because people never agree on what the demagogue means!)\r\n\r\nWhile the Wizard's First Rule is a saddening fact of human nature, we should take heart in the fact that despite humans being stupid and often being caught in the same traps, tyrants still fall and progress is eventually made and we somehow manage to muddle through and humanity survives long enough for the next crisis.

I took a look and after a while came back with \"Well sure. We could use Programming Language M that has an API that lets us integrate into Software X so we can export the output data. Then we'll have to use Library N which lets us generate files in the format compatible with Standard Y. What project is this for by the way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it's not a bespoke project. It's a product we're going to develop with a partner company.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh.\" That set off some alarm bells, so I pointed out that Programming Language M and Library N required the client to install two different runtimes on the client machine. I suggested we consider itself writing our own conversion library so that we wouldn't have to require two different runtimes, but the cost estimates turned out to be prohibitive so of course we went with the more complicated stack with two runtimes.\r\n\r\nIt was a disaster. It turned out to be almost impossible to convince users to install and try out our software when the installation process included a step where the user needed to download and install a programming runtime from an external website (the licensing terms of the runtime did not allow us to package it together with our installer). In hindsight, it was probably a newbie mistake since this was the first time we were working on software product development. If this was our usual bespoke software project where users had IT staff to install software on their enterprise systems, it wouldn't be a problem.\r\n\r\nI learned a lot of technical stuff from that project (there was a lot of math involved in the data export too), but the most important thing I learned was that the best software product in the world is going to fail if you make it difficult for your users to install it.",

Because of the unstable nature of the project, there was always a lot of duplication, unused/unnecessary/obsolete classes/functions/files and so on. Unnecessarily large CSS files where most of the selectors were no longer really needed or JS libraries that weren't actually used. That kind of thing.\r\n\r\nIt's one of those things that you'll never get official approval from management to do, so you have to somehow sneak it in during your daily tasks. But it's important for a couple of reasons:\r\n\r\n  Having too much cluttered code makes your system a lot harder to grok. That means new developers will have a much higher learning curve, and existing developers will find it difficult to be assigned tasks in modules and functions they're not familiar with. Lower understanding means more bugs, lower quality and so on.\r\n  Having a lot of unused files, classes, functions, etc. bloats the build process (making build times longer, extending development cycles) and makes build files bigger (extending deployment times)\r\n\r\nA lot of developers prefer not to throw away old code, for fear that \"we might need it later\". They would prefer to just comment them out in large blocks (making the code a lot more unreadable) or just leaving dangling functions/classes unused. The reason is hogwash of course, since you should be using source control, and source control means never being afraid to delete old code. (Of course, you should make sure what you're deleting is really no longer in use!)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

One would assume that having more time meant I would be better able to organize my stuff and all that, but one would be wrong. My room still has stacks of books, toys, Magic cards and other stuff in random places.\r\n\r\nOr maybe I just have too much OCD that I want everything to be neat and organized, but I'm not industrious enough to make it happen. I'm sure there are people a lot more cluttered than me.\r\n\r\nTowards the start of the year, I told myself I should throw out/get rid of/dispose of at least one thing a day. It's one of those relatively easy things to do I haven't been able to maintain.\r\n\r\nWhy do we keep around all this old stuff we don't need?\r\n\r\nPart of it may be from a mentality of scarcity -- we don't want to throw away stuff for fear of finding out that we may need it later. But reasonably, if you haven't used a thing in years, maybe you'll never use it and even if you had need of one, how difficult would it be to find one again? Some kind of pack rat mentality. I know a few of my friends who would be very familiar with this.\r\n\r\nOther things we keep around for some sort of nostalgia or as keepsakes of other people and faraway places. That's fine I suppose, but maybe one shouldn't put too much value in things that don't actually have them. Case in point: I have a bunch of rocks here from different countries I visited in Europe, haha. Pictures, letters, and other personal keepsakes one might consider digitizing and storing in the cloud.\r\n\r\nHaving a cluttered space has a cost, one that's difficult to ascertain or quantify. Not only do things look messy, but things are harder to find when you need them most. There's also a strange satisfaction that comes from achieving a fine, organized space (before it all falls back into chaos of course.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

This tendency is self-reinforcing -- once it becomes known that the developer is an \"expert\" in the given module, there is a tendency that he will be assigned the most difficult and urgent tasks or fixes related to that module, further cementing his expertise. Thus, the developer becomes a sort of specialist within the system.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to a specialist, you will also sometimes have developers who prefer to be generalists. That is, they are comfortable working with any part of the system, although their familiarity and knowledge are probably not as deep as the specialist for any given module.\r\n\r\nBoth generalists and specialists are valuable in different situations. If you need a complicated change done quickly on a particular module with minimum impact, it's best to have a specialist who is very familiar with how everything works. On the other hand, generalists are very useful from a resource management perspective, since they can jump in to help at any time in any part of the codebase. Say, if your specialist is sick or out of town and you urgently need to do a small change, the generalist can probably take it on no problem.\r\n\r\nIdeally, you train more than one specialist per module of interest in your system, through some sort of mentoring or maybe pair programming, but not all dev teams have that luxury (mostly due to schedule or resource constraints). It's best for software dev teams to find the right mix of generalists and specialists that their particular development process entails.",

When you actually click the button, the alert will show the last value of the variable when the block finished execution (2) instead of the value at the time the function was initialized (1).\r\n\r\nI thought about this because another developer raised a similar problem to me a few days ago. He had a loop that was initializing click handlers for an array of elements. Of course I can't replicate his example here, but let's say we wanted to add click handlers to an array of buttons that would show the result of multiplying an input value by different integers.\r\n\r\n{{ highlight javascript }}\r\n    var btns = [];\r\n    btns.push(document.getElementById(\"BTN1\"));\r\n    btns.push(document.getElementById(\"BTN2\"));\r\n    btns.push(document.getElementById(\"BTN3\"));\r\n    btns.push(document.getElementById(\"BTN4\"));\r\n    var input = document.getElementById(\"IN\");\r\n\r\n    for (var i=0; i<4; i++) {\r\n      btns[i].onclick = function() {\r\n        alert(input.value*(i+2));\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n{{ /highlight }}\r\n\r\nThis is kind of an analogous example for the problem. In this case, the expected behavior is that the first button outputs the input value times 2, while the second button outputs the input value times 3, and so on. But because each of the click handlers retains a reference to the loop counter i, what they will remember on execution is the last value of i after the loop exits, that is, i==4. All the buttons will show the same output.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to correct the behavior. One way would be to build the click handlers using a utility function, like so:\r\n\r\n{{ highlight javascript }}\r\n    var btns = [];\r\n    btns.push(document.getElementById(\"BTN1\"));\r\n    btns.push(document.getElementById(\"BTN2\"));\r\n    btns.push(document.getElementById(\"BTN3\"));\r\n    btns.push(document.getElementById(\"BTN4\"));\r\n    var input = document.getElementById(\"IN\");\r\n\r\n    function getClickHandler(counter) {\r\n      return function() {\r\n        alert(input.value*(counter+2));\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n    \r\n    for (var i=0; i<4; i++) {\r\n      btns[i].onclick = getClickHandler(i);\r\n    }\r\n{{ /highlight }}\r\n\r\n\r\nThis way, the value for the local function variable \"counter\" is locked in once getClickHandler exits execution, and each returned function now has a reference to a different \"counter\", and the buttons will behave as expected.",

The benefits should be obvious: when you have a wide variety of tools under your belt and are able to quickly learn to use a new tool, the number of work options you have increases greatly.\r\n\r\nHappily, programming languages share a lot of similar constructs. Only your first programming language (when you first learn programming) should provide you with any difficulty -- once you've cleared that hurdle, learning additional programming languages shouldn't be too much of a concern.\r\n\r\nYou typically start with syntax, variable declarations, function declarations and program flow (loops, conditionals and so on). Some languages may have a strange syntax that don't share much in common with other programming languages, but that's pretty much not a concern as long as you have access to a modern-day compiler that will tell you when you stray from the desired syntax.\r\n\r\nI find that learning a programming language is best done the same way you actually program -- iteratively. Learn something new, try it out, modify it a bit, try it out, and so on. I once had to help someone prepare for a programming interview where he would be expected to know C++. He had learned it before in college, but hadn't used it for a few years, but for some reason he stuck to reading up on it instead of taking my suggestion to install a compiler and actually try out all the suggestions. (He ended up passing the interview, but that was luckily because they didn't ask too much about syntax.)\r\n\r\nIt also helps a lot to learn about theory and terms and whatnot. Like for object-oriented  programming, it helps to know and understand the concepts behind polymorphism, inheritance, abstract classes and so on. When studying different programming languages, you can then easily compare how they are done in one language vs another, making it easier for you to carry over design concepts to the new language you are learning. Being familiar with the terms and vocabulary also helps you communicate better with mentors, teachers, and fellow learners studying the same language.\r\n\r\nBuilding small toy applications with the new programming language is a great way to learn too. Or maybe if you had a certain project in mind that you wanted to do, you could use the new language with it. Slightly related: When I was consulting with a startup on developing a new product, I asked the CTO whether he preferred to use a technology stack that the developers were more familiar with (to reduce learning costs) or whether he wanted to try this different language that neither of us had tried before, and he told me that one of the great things about being in a startup was that he could choose to do new projects with new technologies to expand their horizons and not have to listen to higher-ups shut it down for fear of increased costs.\r\n\r\nFor the longest time, I tried to learn at least one new programming language/platform a year. For 2016, it was Unity/C#, although I've also started studying Node.js in the past month or so. I hope it's something I'm able to keep up, even as I'm trying to explore new skills other than programming.\r\n\r",

Here are some things I've noted down about how to work smartly towards self-improvement in any given skill:\r\n\r\n  Start with the basics, and keep up with the basics. When Sakuragi joined the club, they first made him practice dribbling in the corner, and despite his complaints it paid off when he actually got to play because he had really smooth dribbling. It can suck and be boring to be stuck doing simple things or studying theory or background first when you want to skip ahead to the fun, complicated, show-off stuff, but having a solid foundation to work on will help you get a lot further later on.\r\n  *Have a target. *What's your goal when studying this skill? Do you want to become the best in the world in a competitive sport? Do you want to be able to converse in a foreign language? How much time and effort are you willing to spend? Knowing the answers to these questions lets you understand when you are pushing yourself too hard or not putting in enough effort.\r\n  Practice, practice, practice. I sometimes answer questions on Quora, and one of the common questions I see there is of the form \"How can I get better at X\"? And my response is inevitably some form of \"There is no substitute for regular practice, good old time and effort.\" followed by specific suggestions for the particular X. I used to play competitive Magic the Gathering a lot, and used to place decently in local tournaments on a regular basis. But that was when I had a larger playgroup that I spent a lot of time with and when I was still playing a lot. These days I will only pop in for a tournament every so often, and predictably I seldom do so well anymore. Even if you've been doing something for a long time, regular practice makes a hell of a lot of difference.\r\n  *Try to improve at least a little bit every time. *Every practice session, every time. Even if you improve only 0.1% every time, the magic of compound interest means those gains will scale up quickly.\r\n  *Study how other people do things and overcome challenges. *I love fighting games like Street Fighter, and one of the great things about the modern age is that fighting game enthusiasts have access to a whole lot of replays of top-level competitive fighting that they can watch and study to help improve their own fighting games. (Sadly I do not yet have the execution skills necessary to become competitively good at it -- not enough practice probably, see above.) Studying other people's work gives you insight into different ways of doing things and can unlock different pathways in your brain, allowing you more opportunities to think outside your own box and find more chances for improvement.\r\n  *Keep pushing the difficulty. *Try not to settle for the same level of skill so you can keep improving. Take small steps to improve your game. Handicap yourself in different ways and see how you can compensate. Compete against people who are better than you, and study how they fight you.\r\n  *Study different approaches. *Try out new strategies or new ideas; even if you just discard them later you will have learned something. You might find that the most common approach to learning a skill is not necessarily the best one for you.\r\n  Know your weaknesses and shore them up. If you have a certain style or technique you have a hard time with, practice that more or study it more intensely. While studying Spanish on Duolingo, I know that I always have trouble constructing sentences that use object pronouns so I try to special attention when such sentences come up, and I try to review them more often.\r\n  *Keep track of your progress. *While not always practical or doable, being able to track your progress, even as a high-level estimate, allows you to measure the rate at which you improve. It gives you a good idea of when you are doing well and when you are having difficulty and helps you compensate accordingly.\r\n  *Reward yourself when you do well, and take a break every so often. *As with all things, balance is something to consider.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r",

I wrote more than 3,000 words from the last hours of the 29th up to the early hour of the 30th to push across the target count. According to the official word count tool on the site, I am at 50,135 words. The novel is terrible and it will never see the light of day as it is, but it has a start, it has a plot that it follows to the end, and it has an ending which while I'm not totally happy with, is good enough for a first draft.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http://d1lj9l30x2igqs.cloudfront.net/nano-2013/files/2016/11/NaNoWriMo2016WebBanner_Winner.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1500\" height=\"555\" /\r\n\r\nGetting the obvious question out of the way first: no, I'm not going to release or publish the draft as it is.

At some point I will revisit this story and attempt to rework it into something better, but for now, I'm just happy to be done and will set it aside for now.\r\n\r\nI think there are two reasons that this attempt succeeded where previous attempts had failed: First is that I came in significantly more prepared this time than my last attempts since I actually had a story idea and an outline for what I had in my head. Granted, I had to expand and add upon that outline multiple times, but at least I had something decent to start with. Second reason is that I believe I have significantly more self-discipline this time around, as a result of all of the daily habits I've taken up this year. I'm less likely to skip writing for a day due to laziness or being sad about world events or whatever, and more likely to drag myself out of bed to force myself to write some number of words for the day.\r\n\r\nWhat struck me about the process is the number of parallels I could draw to software development:\r\n\r\n  In software development, you need some sort of specifications or requirements to get going, and work proceeds smoothly the more detailed those specs are. When writing, having your outline and a vision of what happens in the story makes writing go by faster and more smoothly; when I get to parts that I have not planned out in detail I tend to flounder about until I can figure it out.\r\n  Scope creep happens in writing too! My initial story idea was about a wandering sell-sword who passes by a small rural village and gets caught up in trying to resolve a \"curse\" that the villagers believe they are under. But at the outline stage I already knew it was too short (I couldn't list enough scenes), so I expanded it a bit with a backstory that the protagonist was actually a fugitive and although he stops to help the villagers with good intentions, he draws them into his troubles when his pursuers chance upon him. As I wrote, I realized I needed even more details so I found myself weaving a more detailed plot about how he became a fugitive because he had unwittingly uncovered a political plot and had to escape with a certain artifact, which led to me detailing the back story of that artifact that turned into a mythos and history for the world the story was set in. Yup, it escalated pretty quickly.\r\n  There's a famous quote in software development that mentions one of the difficult problems as naming, and in writing, the same applies! I made liberal use of online random name generators for characters, cities, continents, etc. Midway through, I had to rename a couple of the main characters (lots of find and replace) and three timesI even renamed the main continent on which the story takes place, and I'm still not happy with what I have now.\r\n  When writing large programs, I have a tendency to code the interesting bits first, then I'm left with a whole lot of drudgery such as boilerplate code or CRUD screens to do. Writing turns out to be the same, I wrote a lot of the interesting scenes first then deferred those I had trouble with or hadn't figured out too well. It led to some problems; if you saw my draft you would notice some points where the story jumps forward abruptly leaving the reader to infer what had happened in between. Those were points where I had difficulty deciding how to get from point A to point B and just decided to write the other end first and try to work backwards, but never did figure it out completely.\r\n  When programming, you can get too engrossed in a particular part of the program such that you put too much work into it which turns out to be unnecessary. In this draft, I enjoyed writing the world's mythos and back story a bit too much, I kind of set the framework for a series of stories in the same world, and some of the back story parts are better off told in succeeding books since they are not especially relevant to the plot of this one.\r\n\r\nSome other non-programming related notes:\r\n\r\n  Towards the start, I felt like I was writing too much dialogue (might have been a result of reading too many Brian Michael Bendis comics) and later on I adjusted by writing more prose. This also helped for some difficult moments, for example I had two characters where I wanted to get them into a shouting match but had trouble writing the dialogue to develop it, so instead I just used prose to describe the increasing tension of their discussion.\r\n  I made a silly decision early on to give the main character a speech affectation -- he spoke in an archaic formal speech that was unusual for people in that region. It wasn't a big deal and there was a story reason for it and it made him feel more distinctive, but it also meant I had to be more careful later on when writing dialogue for the character.\r\n  Making up some elements on the fly kind of got in my way; about 70% through I suddenly had the bright idea that a \"good\" character I had alluded to in an earlier flashback would actually be the \"big bad\" who was behind the conspiracy all along. This was fine, but it led to some plot acrobatics where I had to engineer some complicated scenarios to justify my decision, and it meant my ending had to be a bit different from what I had previously wanted.\r\n\r\nHaving the daily quota was a strange experience. I was over quota most days, but also had some days where I was under quota. I found myself preferring to write in scenes, such that I won't switch scenes within the same day, so some scenes felt like they were a bit too long because I was stretching them to fit in the writing quota for that day. And the quota also meant that whenever I was already over quota for a certain day but still had a clear idea of what to write, I had the option to stop and just \"bank\" those thoughts and continue the scene the next day. I never tried to pull too far ahead (except for the last two days); I figured I needed to get used to the rhythm of writing a set amount per day, instead of in bursts as I might have done in previous attempts.\r\n\r\nI tracked my daily progress via a spreadsheet (word counts are using Google Docs' built-in word count tool. The nano site's word count tool had a different final count for some reason.)figure id=\"attachment_1569\" style=\"width: 663px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1569\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dailynano.png\" alt=\"Nanowrimo 2016 Daily Log\" width=\"663\" height=\"641\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dailynano.png 663w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/dailynano-300x290.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 663px) 100vw, 663px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Nanowrimo 2016 Daily Log/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm happy with the experience, despite not being entirely happy with my own output. I learned a lot and now have a better sense of how long fifty thousand words actually is and what size a novel-size story really should be. I now have some idea of how quickly I can write, and how much \"writing energy\" I can spare for a day (I was actually in danger of falling behind on regular blogging at one point because I spent all my \"writing energy\" on nanowrimo.) I say \"writing energy\" because I find that I draw from a different pool of energy as compared to say, when I'm sketching. It's probably not super indicative -- I could probably have been writing more each day if I spend more time in preparation and outlining.\r\n\r\nI will attempt to write more in 2017, but maybe not yet on revising this particular work. I have some other ideas I'm thinking of visiting, not necessarily for nanowrimo. I don't know if this will lead anywhere -- I still have no idea if I could really write fiction for a living for example -- but I think at least trying to write more will be a worthy endeavor to explore.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://nanowrimo.org\r",

Some kind of mental block makes it difficult. And you try to focus your mind and clear your thoughts, but it just doesn't help. Here are some ideas for how to get past mental blocks.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1591\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mentalblock.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"2048\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mentalblock.png 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mentalblock-150x150.png 150w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mentalblock-300x300.png 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mentalblock-768x768.png 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mentalblock-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mentalblock-1200x1200.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /\r\n\r\n  Toss out ideas that weren't working and start over. One example is today's blog post. I promised myself I would be posting regularly, so I had to have one today. But after a couple of failed attempts that just couldn't come together, I had to stop and ask myself what was wrong. I just wasn't in the mood for any of the other serious topics I wanted to write about so I said screw it, I'll just write about mental blocks!\r\n  *Phone it in. *If you're unfamiliar, the expression means \"just do the bare minimum you're allowed to do.\" Just power through the work with as little effort as possible. You can always go back and edit it later if you want! I often do this with the daily sketches -- I try to stay on theme and at the same time find something interesting or clever to draw. But I'm not always successful, and I sometimes don't have enough time. So I'll just draw whatever that barely makes the theme and send it in.\r\n  If you have some time, step away from the work for a bit. Take a shower. Poop. Argue with people over the internet. Watch some Brooklyn Nine Nine. Play some _Skyrim. _Just get your mind off the work. It gives your subconscious mind a chance to work on the problems in the background and later you can come back to the work with fresh eyes and hopefully better ideas.\r\n  Cheat. Find someone who's done something similar before and copy, er I mean, draw inspiration from her work!\r\n  Make a long list of ideas. Just random, stupid, ideas, as many as you can think of, as soon as they pop into your head. You're throwing spaghetti at the wall and trying to see what sticks!\r\n  Do the easy stuff first, then get back to the hard stuff later. I did this during my Nanowrimo this year! Whenever I had too much difficulty writing a scene, I would set it aside for a while and choose some other scene that I had already mostly plotted out in my head. You might think \"Doesn't that just mean I'll have more hard stuff to do later?\" Yes, yes it does, but also means that hard stuff will have a whole lot of easy stuff already written to support it, which can make things easier.\r\n  *Use random content generators. *There's a bunch of them on the internet! For writing, I sometimes use random name generators to help me out. There's also random plot generators and random dialogue generators and so on. Most of the time you'll get nonsense, but just clicking through those nonsense options can give you an inspiration for your own creative needs.\r\n  *Change it up. *If you're drawing, try drawing in a different style than you usually do. If you're writing a story, try to throw in a random scene that's a completely different style and makes no sense. If you're blogging, write a post about something you've never written about before, or in a style you've never used. Like a listicle!\r\n  *Ask for help. *In software development, there's a concept called \"Rubber Duck Debugging\", or sometimes simply \"Rubber Ducking\". The idea is that by asking other people for help, even if the other person is completely useless, the mere act of describing your problem helps you think through it and unlocks new ideas. As a bonus, sometimes the other person can actually be helpful!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/mentalblock.png\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/2016/12/nanowrimo-2016-post-mortem/\r",

At one point, one of the Americans said to my boss that he was pleasantly surprised that I was openly speaking up independently of my boss and willing to correct him on some points when he didn't quite get the technical details right. It seems they were used to working with some Indian outsourcing firms, where due to cultural differences, the tendency was for the Indian guys to accept everything the Americans asked for without question and delivered it exactly as requested, even if there were obvious problems.\r\n\r\nThe concept is called Power Distance, where cultures with a higher power distance are more likely to just accept without question the authority of \"higher-ups\". While in cultures with lower power distance, people feel less of a gap with people of \"higher\" status, and are thus more willing to speak up openly.\r\n\r\nI believe that I live and work in a country with a high power distance. It is typical of workers here to have an exchange like:\r\n\r\n \"Why are we doing this, isn't it kind of dumb?\"\r\n \r\n \"Because the boss says so.\"\r\n \r\n \"Oh, ok\"\r\n\r\nNot just with people in \"higher\" positions, but especially with foreigners. I witnessed this first hand when I first observed how other people behaved when they first had to work with our project managers who were based in another country; many would be hesitant to raise their concerns directly with the foreign counterparts.\r\n\r\nIn an industry where users and clients and management often do not really understand the finer technical details of what exactly they want to happen, being able and willing to raise concerns regardless of differences in position or status is not only a distinct advantage, it may very well be an important aspect of the job. All the best developers I've worked with are the ones who are willing to call out problems, and it's a trait I personally encourage in anyone I work with.\r\n\r",

The ending was...  well, kind of sequel-baiting. A mixture of disappointment and confusion and hope haha. I don't imagine that they'll have a sequel set in the same universe/timeline, so it felt a bit like they made up a ridiculous explanation that would attempt to explain some of the nonsense that happens in the game.\r\n\r\nHere's an imgur album with some stuff I screen-grabbed along the way:\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/CEbsI\"\r\n  p\r\n    a href=\"//imgur.com/CEbsI\"/a\r\n  /p\r\n/blockquote",

They feel that they will be unable to find better or at least similar work and will rather stay than risk it. It's a false sense of \"job security\" vs fear. It might be true that you have no good options. But if you're not looking at all, it's 100% surely true.\r\n\r\nEven if you don't find better options, the act of looking for them helps you through some sort of catharsis. It confirms if you really have no choice but to stay. It helps you understand your place in the job market and what you can do to improve your position and maybe open up more options later on.\r\n\r\nBottom line: if you're unhappy in any way (as indicated by any of the signs above), you should at least be looking.

You can additionally provide validation on the client side (via JavaScript), but this is only a concession towards a better user experience and should not be used as a substitute for server-side validation.\r\n\r\nOne would think that anyone with a basic understanding of how HTTP works would understand the above easily and any failure to practice it should be considered amateur hour. But in shops where most of the testing is done manually, developers can easily fall into the habit of adding the client-side validations (since failing to do so would earn them a bug report) and forgetting the server-side validations altogether.\r\n\r\nThe main problems are that (a) HTTP requests can be spoofed, they do not need to have come from a form submitted via a browser; and (b) even for forms submitted via a browser, the Javascript validations may have been tampered with on the client-side.\r\n\r\nFor explicit validations for which you wrote out some logic (for example: email address must be so-and-so format), it is obvious that you need that on the server side. But for some classes of validation you may forget to handle them especially if they do not explicitly generate errors in the webpage on the client-side.\r\n\r\nFirst example: when the contents of a drop-down list are dependent on some other value on the form. On the client-side you probably already restrict the choices such that the user is unable to select an invalid combination so it doesn't look like a check is needed. But on the server-side, you still have to check that the choice submitted for the drop-down field is a valid value given the other values submitted in the request.\r\n\r\nSecond example: when you hide or disable certain fields in the web page depending on some other value on the form. Same as above, you don't need to add a specific check on the client-side since the user is already prevented from doing so by the UI. But on the server-side, you have to make sure not to save or process any values from those hidden/disabled fields if the other values on the form indicate they shouldn't be processed.\r\n\r\nWeak validations on the server side are dangerous because at the very least they will create bad data in your system and at the very worst may expose you to security vulnerabilities.\r\n\r",

Inevitably, every Friday around noon someone would message the others asking \"where are we eating?\". Now, there are a lot of good places to eat around the area and we've all been working there a while so most of the time we don't care where we eat and we'd say we'll decide when we get to the elevators. We get to the elevators but we're still not sure where to eat. So we take the elevators down and we'll figure it out downstairs. What often happened is that we ended up walking around, wasting time and eventually just choosing a place at random. It was a weird sort of decision-making.\r\n\r\nDecision making can be tough, especially for big, complicated decisions that need to be evaluated on multiple axes. Buying a house, choosing a new job, and yes, even where to have lunch, these are all examples of possibly tough decisions.\r\n\r\nIdeally, you are able to put forth a set of requirements for your decisions and then you check which among the available options best fulfills the requirements. Sometimes that approach is insufficient. It can be because you are lacking information or have too much information or have too many choices or none of the choices are acceptable or you are unable to properly evaluate the trade-offs between different criteria, or maybe even that your subconscious has a set of \"secret\" requirements that you are unable to formalize.\r\n\r\nSome notes I've kept on decision-making:\r\n\r\n  Spending too much time on decision-making is a cost. Be aware if there is a time limit to your decision making.\r\n  For most things, decision-making should be quick and easy. Minimize decision making for unimportant (read: low cost or low impact) stuff. For example, remembering passwords. Either use an app or a scheme so that you don't have to decide or try to remember what the password for each site is. \"Don't sweat the small stuff.\"\r\n  It's okay to use your guts or emotions to make an initial decision, then validate if it's okay using more empirical criteria. If your emotions don't lead anywhere, measure and use data, pros/cons to determine best course of action\r\n  Understand the difference between an acceptable choice and the best choice. It may be easier to settle merely for a choice which is acceptable rather than spending extra time to try to find the best choice.\r\n  span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"Not making a choice is also a choice. Sometimes not all the choices will satisfy your standard or requirements. Don't forget that abstaining or deciding not to do anything can also be a valid choice./span\r\n  If you’re having trouble choosing between some options, that means they are mostly within an acceptable range for you (if any of the options was flat out unacceptable you would have rejected them on the spot). In that case, just choose one at random (literally roll a dice if you can’t decide) and go. If it turns out later that it wasn’t the best choice, figure out if there was any information that would have helped you, take note of it for next time.\r\n  Be careful when making big purchases. Even if you have already made a decision, you may want to delay it a bit for really big amounts to give your subconscious some time to ponder it. (This is really more about money management than decision making...  but I had it in this list so here you go)\r\n  span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"In moments of self-doubt, ask other people for advise. It can be friends and family or even random strangers on the internet./span\r\n\r\nBack to the lunch out story. Some years later, a different lunch group (that I was occasionally a part of) thought of a better approach: they set up an automated email that got sent out to the members around 11:30am. The program would choose at random one of the nearby places to eat, making the decision for the group. If anyone objected to the randomly selected choice, they bore the responsibility for providing the new choice.\r\n\r\nLife is too short to waste on poor decision making.",

If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.\"\r\n  \r\n ― Sun Tzu, The Art of War\r\n\r\nI was reading a forum thread recently about learning competitive Street Fighter. The poster was using a particular character (his \"main\") and asking how he could learn to counter the attack strings of other characters. The answers from more experienced players were pretty much what I would have expected: you had to dedicate specific time and effort to each matchup you wanted to study. That meant going into training mode, looking at the opposing character's attack strings and seeing where he could interrupt them or the proper way to answer them. It meant a lot of hard work too, since fighting games typically have a lot of characters. So reaching the top tiers meant understanding each opposing character in and out, knowing their strengths and weaknesses and so on.\r\n\r\nI think it not only applies to competition, but also to any scenario where there is an opposing party or point of view. In order to make any progress or improvement, it is necessary to understand where the other side is coming from and study their motivations. Sadly, in online debates it often turns into the equivalent of a shouting match where everyone just screams out their POV hoping to brute force their opponent into some kind of \"submission\".\r\n\r\nBack to Street Fighter: When picking up a new fighting game, I typically try to sample all the available characters until I find one whose fighting style I like and am comfortable playing as \"main\" (hint: it's often Ryu lol).\r\n\r\nIn the same way, in any online discussion it's important to expose yourself to a variety of opinions, and not limit your discussions only to people with similar views. Political discussion online can get toxic so it becomes tempting to block out those views that you disagree with, but this tends to create an echo chamber effect. It's a good idea to keep a healthy amount of opposing views on your feeds. Although where you draw the line is of course your own decision; Personally I try to avoid blocking any friends and have not yet had occasion to do so, although I do block any sites that tend to promote misinformation or stuff like racism.\r\n\r\nUnlike competition, the goal of an online discussion (especially for sensitive topics like politics) isn't really winning. Discussion should lead to some sort of progress or learning, or in the worst case, \"agreeing to disagree\". But regardless of the outcome, understanding opposing points of view should give you valuable insights into your own views, and maybe even convince you to reconsider them.\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by MrValdez on 2017-01-17 12:45:58 +0000\r\nAny chance you've read Sirlin's Playing to Win book?\r\n\r\nHe talks about how competitive playing will bring out the best in you if you remove bad mentality (such as that shouting contest you mentioned) and play with your best.

This time I wanted to add some smarter behavior to make it more able to figure out when to group files into folders without constantly needing manual intervention from me. To do this, I needed to persist some data between runs -- so that the script remembers how it categorized previous files and is able to group similar files together.\r\n\r\nNow since my software development career has largely been as an enterprise-y kind of developer, my first thought was to just use a database to store the data. I already had a MySql installation on my machine so that was fine, I just needed Python to interface with it. After looking up how to do it, I balked at having to install a new Python library just to connect to MySql and reconsidered.\r\n\r\nAs programmers, we have a tendency sometimes to over-engineer solutions because that's what we're used to doing. Did I really need a database for this? The data won't be very big, and I won't need to do any sort of maintenance on it, so maybe a simpler solution was in order.\r\n\r\nI ended up just using pickle, which was already built-in to Python:\r\n\r\n{{ highlight python }}\r\ndef load_db():\r\n\tall_series = {}\r\n\twith open(DATABASE_FILE, 'rb') as handle:\r\n\t\tall_series = pickle.load(handle)\r\n\treturn all_series\r\n\r\ndef savedb(allseries):\r\n\twith open(DATABASE_FILE, 'wb') as handle:\r\n\t\tpickle.dump(allseries, handle, protocol=pickle.HIGHESTPROTOCOL)\r\n{{ /highlight }}\r\n\r\n(Above code probably gives you an idea what kind of files I'm sorting... )\r\n\r\nAs an added benefit, I didn't need to design any database schemas or tables or whatnot, pickle just lets me serialize the map as-is and reload it later from disk without any hassle.\r\n\r\nI guess my lesson here was: don't over-complicate things when something simple will work fine. Write the simplest code that can do the job.",

Churchill\r\n\r\nIn the current world political climate, it seems that in many instances democracy and the related values (equality, human rights, and so on) are increasingly taking a back seat to populism and increasingly authoritarian leaderships. One sometimes has to consider whether authoritarian states would in fact be more effective in this day and age. After all, China's ascension as a world power shows that even authoritarian states are able to achieve great gains.\r\n\r\nThe allure of authoritarianism is understandable for anyone who's been exposed to problematic democracies: progress is often held back by countless deliberations, committee meetings, legislative mills, and various other processes that mean elected officials are able to accomplish very little until it's time again for them to think about the next election.\r\n\r\nThe authoritarian state on the other hand has the advantage of being able to push a singular vision, since it has concentrated power unto itself, it can set aside any dissent and other discussion, put its foot down and say \"this is what we're doing, let's do it.\"\r\n\r\nI guess it might also seem to be easier on an individual level? You just have to trust your leadership (since you probably don't have a choice) and not think too hard about things other than what's going on in your own life. This is probably also why authoritarian states are more likely to try to get away with rights violations and such -- people are more concerned with their own survival and their own lives and not too worry too much about the things the state is doing to \"other people\".\r\n\r\nThe risk of course of such a single-minded \"getting things done\" attitude is: you might not be doing the right thing. When the state has concentrated power unto itself, there is a tendency to promote only those ideas and projects and whatnot that adhere to the state's singular vision. Another problem is that anyone who dissents or holds different values than the authoritarian state's singular vision can be labelled or vilified as enemies of progress.\r\n\r\nAuthoritarian states also have the tendency to set aside values commonly held in democratic states: freedom of expression and religion, human rights and equality, and so on, if they are seen to hinder progress. I guess you have to consider whether as a society, you are willing to sacrifice these values in the name of getting things done. And it's sad when you find that many of your countrymen don't consider democratic values all that important.\r\n\r\nDemocracy on the other hand, due to the nature of (in theory) every voice being given value, has a stronger tendency towards a diversity of ideas, so that more options are considered and thus theoretically better decisions are made. This mirrors the natural world, where genetic diversity allows a species to more easily thrive and adapt to changing circumstances. In the same way, we hope that by encouraging debate and dissent democracies are better able to adapt to the challenges the world presents.\r\n\r\nAuthoritarianism is great when you have leadership that you can trust to make good and wise decisions for the betterment of all. But humans are weak and fallible beings prone to faults such as arrogance, pride, greed, and so forth, so more likely than not the leadership in an authoritarian state cannot be trusted. While the same can be said of democracies (since in the real world there are no perfect democracies), at least in democracies we have a greater chance of being able to change the state of affairs to try something new.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

You guys do [that country's thing] right?\" or  \"This person is a supporter of [politician] so he must support all the things that politician does, even the things I hate.\" Or in the modern world, there are even worse stereotypes.\r\n\r\nBoxes and stereotypes are convenient because it means we don't need to relearn our reactions and opinions when presented with a new person. We simply choose a convenient box to put them in and then we convince ourselves we are treating them appropriately.\r\n\r\nBut the real world is not so discrete. The real world is a lot more granular, a lot more nuanced. While it is inconvenient for your mental model, people will usually not fit exactly into any of your preconceived boxes. Or they may fit in multiple boxes. Or maybe none at all.\r\n\r\nEvery time you put a person into a box, you discredit her by some amount. In your mind, you shave off some of who he is a person so that he better fits your box. And for many instances, maybe that's okay. Maybe you don't have any significant interaction with that person, and the simpler mental model is sufficient. You don't need to understand the character nuances of every grocery store cashier for example.\r\n\r\nBut beyond that, in order to pursue any kind of meaningful interaction with another person, that is insufficient. We must be willing to set aside whatever box you have put a person into and be willing to understand all those little bits we set aside. Those nuances characterize and define the individual, not whatever box we have put him into.",

If you got stuck in a game, you just head on over to GameFAQs or some other site and someone on the message boards will tell you how to get unstuck. Or you can even watch Youtube videos on how to do it! (Side note: I dislike having to watch Youtube videos to figure stuff out. I read really quickly so I prefer some descriptive text.) (Side note #2: I have amazingly written about the youtube thing back in 2006)\r\n\r\nBack in the olden days of gaming, there was no internet. All you had was word of mouth and lots of free time for trial and error. There was this guy we knew where whenever we came over to his house he would have some new _Super Mario Bros. 3 _tricks for us, we had no idea how he figured them out.\r\n\r\nSometimes you'd be lucky and you'd have a friend who had an issue of _Nintendo Power _or something and there's a whole lot of secrets in just one issue and you wanted to show off to your friends so you tell them all these tricks. That's how word of mouth happens.\r\n\r\nEven fighting games like Street Fighter II, when they first came out in the arcades, the machines didn't have movelists or anything like they do now. We had to guess. People figured out how to do fireballs by word of mouth. I remember the first time I played it in the arcade, I was jiggling the joystick randomly trying to figure out how to dragon punch. I had to read an issue of GamePRO to find out how many different throws Zangief actually had. Then GamePRO did an April Fools article where they claimed that there was a secret character Shen Long in the game (based on Ryu's poorly-translated win quote \"You must defeat Shen Long to stand a chance\"). The article had screenshots and everything. What a cruel trick to play on a playerbase where secrets spread by word of mouth.\r\n\r\nI finished _Day of the Tentacle Remastered _ on PS4 a while back. It was great. DoTT was one of the first PC games I ever played. I was in 3rd year high school when I played the first game Maniac Mansion at a friend's house. Back then we didn't have walkthroughs or anything so we could literally be stuck for days on one puzzle or whatever. We had to try all combinations of inventory items with verbs and environment items. The Remaster even had a command to highlight all interactible items in the environment, that would have been a big help back in the day! I don't know how long it took me to finish DoTT back then, but I loved it so much I installed it in a secret directory on one of the computer labs in high school (we were the first batch to actually have a computer lab!). The Remaster I finished it in around 3-4 hours. I didn't need a walkthrough to finish the game (I still remembered a lot), but I did for getting all the achievements (some of them were very obscure).\r\n\r\nI'm actually surprised with how well the point and click adventure game genre is doing so well lately (what with Telltale leading the charge and all), as you really have to be disciplined with trying to avoid walkthroughs, otherwise what's the point? Well, you could enjoy the story I guess, but it's a point of pride to finish without a walkthrough, kind of. I'm still stuck somewhere on episode one of Telltale's Back to the Future. I think I had to open a door or something. If only achievements could detect whether you used the internet to cheat.\r\n\r\nWhen GameFAQs first came out, I was very active on those messageboards. In fact, I probably contributed to a few walkthroughs myself. The great thing about these sites is that they build communities of people actively trying to find secrets and explore every nook and cranny of a single game. I don't have the time nor patience to do that sort of thing anymore, but I'm glad that kind of culture exists. It's that culture that enables people to push games to the extreme -- speedrunners, extreme challenges, etc. can be very entertaining to follow.\r\n\r\nIt's actually a bit ironic that walkthroughs are more commonplace now, given that games are certainly a lot less difficult than they used to be. \"Nintendo-hard\" games are few and far between and appeal to niche audiences only. In the older Dragon Quest or Final Fantasy games you often had to walk around and talk to every available NPC until you find the guy who will move the story forward. These days that guy has an exclamation point over his head and a marker on the minimap and you can fast travel to him too.\r\n\r\nTo be entirely fair, when we were kids we didn't really need walkthroughs because we just had so much damn time. I mean, we had enough time to try to hit every single brick in that stage of Super Mario Bros 3 that was basically pyramids full of bricks, just to see if any of them held secret coins. (Later we found a glitched cartridge that showed us where hidden blocks were, that sped things up a lot.)\r\n\r\nI used to have a strong sense of pride when playing video games, I almost never used walkthroughs when playing through RPGs for example. But things change when you're an adult playing computer games. You have real world stuff to do and not enough time, so you just say screw it when a game makes it too difficult for you. Either you give up on the game or you youtube that stuff.\r\n\r\nThere's some sort of mystery lost when you're playing a game and you know that anytime you get stuck you can just google as a fallback. Well, that's the tradeoff I guess. In exchange though, we get a lot more online gaming content these days, not just walkthroughs: we get let's plays and livestreams and speedruns and all that kind of stuff. Sometimes you don't even have to be playing a game to enjoy the content, so that's kind of cool too.\r\n\r\nAnd you can still finish a game without a walkthrough... you just need the discipline to stay away from the internet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r",

(Your clients are halfway across the world.) They're asking why the website is inaccessible. You check via your browser and sure enough there's an error 500. You have to ssh into the server. Half-asleep, you have to quickly comb through the log files to figure out if there's something you can do about it right now or you have to sadly tell the client that the team has to handle it in the morning.\r\n\r\nNobody expects software errors. And nobody can predict how they will happen. (If we could do that, there wouldn't be any errors!) But in general you should stay ahead of future headaches during development time by having robust error handling and reporting principles in place for your development team to follow.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of errors:\r\n\r\n  Validation errors -- checks on user inputs. These errors are expected, and the most important thing here is to present clear error messages that tell the user what was wrong and how they can correct it.\r\n  Everything else is an unexpected error, which we can breakdown further according to how the development team would react: \r\n      \"That shouldn't happen!\" -- the broadest category, usually caused by human errors in coding/configuration or hardware problems. Examples include: database failure, typos in configuration files, different data formats used by different developers, unexpected system crashes and so on.\r\n      \"Hmm, oh yeah, we didn't think of that.\" -- i.e., design flaws or unhandled cases. These are errors caused by program flow or usage that was not anticipated in the program's design but are considered valid use.\r\n      \"That can't possibly happen!\", also popularly known as \"We have no clue how that happened.\" Most unexpected errors start out under this category then after some detective work (some developers use the term \"debugging\"), it transfers to one of the above categories.\r\n\r\nUnexpected errors may also be either recoverable (the user can either attempt to repeat the operation to continue or use other functions in the system) or catastrophic (the entire system or subsystem is completely unusable.)\r\n\r\nIdeally, what happens when an unexpected error occurs? There's a number of things that probably need to be considered:\r\n\r\n  The user needs to be aware that it's not an error on his part and that the problem needs to be reported to support or the system administrator.\r\n  The user needs to be presented with enough information to give to the support team to allow them to determine the cause and fix the error.\r\n  The program needs to capture what information it can to help the support team find and fix the error.\r\n\r\nFor client-side errors (typically JavaScript problems, but can also be problems in HTML/CSS rendering), all of the above are difficult, since the mechanisms by which you present #1 and #2 and by which you can do #3 may be compromised by the error. Typically for any client-side errors, you are almost entirely reliant on the user's description of the error and the steps that led to it -- not the most reliable source of information, but you make do with what you have. If you are unable to reproduce the error during debugging, you are in for a whole lot of speculation and trial and error.\r\n\r\nFor server-side errors, it's a bit easier than client-side errors. The first two items are typically handled by having a catch-all error page in the application that gives an error code and message for unexpected errors.\r\n\r\nFor the last item, it generally means logging, either to a file or a database-backed audit trail (the file is more reliable). Generally we log the error/exception encountered, including the stack trace, and some log messages on each request/page access. A majority of the time, having the stack trace is sufficient. The access logs allow us to back-trace previous steps which might have contributed to the problem. Any special conditions encountered in the code should also be logged -- this helps to identify errors that can only happen under some combination of special conditions.\r\n\r\nYou don't want to log too much information (what to log might need to be a separate post all on its own), but just enough to help the support team determine the cause of the problem.\r\n\r\nSometimes, the error is specific to the data being used by the users, or happens only in the environment they are using. And the support team investigating the problem will often not have access to that data or that environment, so your logging and the error reports have to be good enough to allow them to deduce the conditions that caused the error.\r\n\r\nError handling for deployed systems is already hard -- so make sure not to make it harder on the future support team by having standard error handling and logging mechanisms.\r\n\r",

There are some liberal licenses that /spanspan class=\"adverb\"span data-offset-key=\"668k1-1-0\"mostly/span/span span data-offset-key=\"668k1-2-0\"let you do anything you want. The MIT license is an example of a very permissive license. Other licenses may provide /spanspan class=\"complexword\"span data-offset-key=\"668k1-3-0\"a number of/span/span span data-offset-key=\"668k1-4-0\"restrictions. Can you integrate with closed-source software? Can you distribute binaries without the source? Do you need to put some kind of attribution somewhere in your software? Another thing to look our for are the so-called viral licenses. /spanspan class=\"hardreadability\"span data-offset-key=\"668k1-5-0\"Viral licenses specify that if you integrate their code into your system, then the terms of that license apply to your own software as well/span/spanspan data-offset-key=\"668k1-6-0\". /spanspan class=\"hardreadability\"span data-offset-key=\"668k1-7-0\" These can be very dangerous from the standpoint of a company developing a commercial product/span/spanspan data-offset-key=\"668k1-8-0\". The most well-known example of such copyleft licenses is the GPL. Integrating GPL code into your system will often mean your software needs to be open source as well. While more open source is good, it may not be in the best interest of your company, so tread /spanspan class=\"adverb\"span data-offset-key=\"668k1-9-0\"lightly/span/spanspan data-offset-key=\"668k1-10-0\"./span\r\n  span data-offset-key=\"74amj-0-0\"Which version of the library will you use? Many open source libraries will release updates on a regular basis. There may be some compatibility issues depending on the version you use. For example the popular open source CMS WordPress releases regular updates. /spanspan class=\"hardreadability\"span data-offset-key=\"74amj-1-0\"If you are integrating with WordPress, you need to decide which version you are supporting/span/spanspan data-offset-key=\"74amj-2-0\". /spanspan class=\"hardreadability\"span data-offset-key=\"74amj-3-0\"You will also need a plan for upgrading to future versions and ensuring compatibility/span/spanspan data-offset-key=\"74amj-4-0\". (See the next item.)/span\r\n  span data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-0-0\"How will you handle bugs and updates in the version you've chosen? /spanspan class=\"hardreadability\"span data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-1-0\"It's happened that our system was having problems due to a bug in an open source Javascript rich text control library/span/spanspan data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-2-0\". After investigating, we found that a fix was available but was only applied in a future version. /spanspan class=\"hardreadability\"span data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-3-0\"Upgrading to that future version would /span/spanspan class=\"complexword\"span data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-4-0\"require/span/spanspan class=\"hardreadability\"span data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-5-0\" that we test the entire system for compatibility problems/span/spanspan data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-6-0\". That was out of the question. I ended up having to apply a fix to our local version only. This meant that we now had a different version from the \"official\" released version. This may lead to further compatibility problems in the future. You should also be aware of licensing issues here too. /spanspan class=\"hardreadability\"span data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-7-0\"The license may /span/spanspan class=\"complexword\"span data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-8-0\"require/span/spanspan class=\"hardreadability\"span data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-9-0\" that you submit any modifications to the community as open source contributions/span/spanspan data-offset-key=\"9tfrc-10-0\"./span\r\n  span data-offset-key=\"d3jml-0-0\"Is there an active help and support system for the software? The demands of enterprise software development often need timely support. There was a time we had to use a certain open source document management system. /spanspan class=\"hardreadability\"span data-offset-key=\"d3jml-1-0\"We later discovered that it was very hard to get help on any issues encountered, either from official channels or the community/span/spanspan data-offset-key=\"d3jml-2-0\". This led to many difficulties and issues in that project. You might also want to check popular programming forums such as StackOverflow. Check how many questions about that library usually remain unanswered. If the number is low, that's a good indicator that you might have trouble looking for help later on./span\r\n  What dependencies does the library have? You might want to make sure the dependencies don't have any problems with the previous items above.\r\n\r\nThe great thing about modern software development is that we have a large number of open source libraries available to use and draw inspiration from, but that doesn't mean you can just willy-nilly pick up just any library. The above questions provide a good starting point for evaluating open source libraries for your use.",

The one I enjoyed the most and did pick up to play regularly was Duelyst. So this review is written from the perspective of someone who has played both Magic the Gathering (MTG) and Hearthstone (HS).\r\n\r\nHearthstone, Spellweaver and Eternal played like digital MTG with some advantages, as I outlined in the HS post linked above. Duelyst keeps many of the same elements and advantages, but adds an extra dimension. Besides being a card game, Duelyst is also a board game.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1724\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201610151049361.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201610151049361.jpg 1920w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201610151049361-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201610151049361-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201610151049361-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201610151049361-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\r\n\r\nBoard game\r\n\r\nIn a game of Duelyst your General (the analogue to Hearthstone's hero) and his minions are played into a 9&#215;5 board. Minions can only be summoned on empty spaces adjacent to one of your units. During your turn, each unit can either: attack an adjacent enemy; or move up to two spaces, then attack an adjacent enemy.\r\n\r\nHaving a board and unit movement greatly enhances the \"positioning matters\" mechanic as compared to Hearthstone. In HS, it only mattered whether minions were adjacent, to the left or to the right. In Duelyst, you can position minions to prevent enemies from reaching your General, or to restrict enemies from moving completely.\r\n\r\nThat means a number of spells and abilities care about positioning too. Each of the available Generals has a Bloodborn spell (BBS), the equivalent of Hearthstone's Hero Power. One of the Generals has a BBS which allows her to deal damage to all enemy units in the same column as the opposing General. This means you have to be careful where you place your minions whenever her BBS is active! There are spells that affect a small area (2&#215;2 or 3&#215;3 and so on). There are spells that care about adjacency (\"Destroy target minion that is not nearby any general\"). And so on.\r\n\r\nFactions and Generals\r\n\r\nHearthstone has different heroes, and each hero has a different card pool available. By contrast, Duelyst has factions and Generals. Each faction has its own card pool, and of course there is a global or \"neutral\" card pool as well. Each faction also has two Generals, each of which has a different BBS. The factions and Generals encourage a lot of different playstyles.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1729\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201702161542171.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201702161542171.jpg 1920w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201702161542171-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201702161542171-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201702161542171-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201702161542171-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\r\n\r\nSome factions like the Songhai are more focused on spell-based damage and backstabs. The Lyonar focus on cheap, efficient creatures. Vetruvian has obelisks that can generate temporary minions. Abyssian focuses on swarm tactics and shadow creep. The Vanar rely on placement and trickery. My favorite General, the Magmar Vaath, likes to go toe-to-toe with the enemy General and punch him in the face!\r\n\r\nKeywords\r\n\r\nAs expected, many of Duelyst keywords care about positioning, and thus have no meaningful equivalent in either MTG or HS. Namely:\r\n\r\n  Airdrop -- minions with Airdrop can be summoned anywhere on the board\r\n  Backstab -- this unit deals extra damage when attacking from behind (yes, even facing matters!) and doesn't receive a counterattack\r\n  Blast -- attack hits all enemies in the same row or column\r\n  Flying -- may move anywhere on the battlefield\r\n  Frenzy -- normal attacks hit ALL adjacent enemies\r\n  Infiltrate -- gains bonus effect if its on the enemy's starting side of the board\r\n  Provoke **-- somewhat like HS's **Taunt. Adjacent enemies cannot move and must attack a Provoke unit if there is one nearby\r\n  Ranged -- can attack from anywhere on the board\r\n  Shadow Creep -- this is a modifier that can be added to board tiles. An enemy standing on Shadow Creep takes 1 damage at the end of the Shadow Creep owner's turn\r\n  *Zeal *-- gains bonus effect as long as it's next to the General\r\n\r\nDuelyst also has a number of keywords that are analogous to abilities in MTG and HS. Rush is the same as MTG's Haste **and HS's **Charge. Opening Gambit **and **Dying Wish are the same as HS's Battlecry and *Deathrattle. *(I worry that at some point new cardgames will run out of names for \"enters the field\" and \"leaves the field\".) And so on -- no need to cover everything here.\r\n\r\nSkill Level, Competitive Play and F2P\r\n\r\nThe added dimension of positioning means that Duelyst is strictly more skill-based than HS. This is obvious if you note that there are a lot more choices for where to place minions. Hearthstone is also more reliant on RNG than Duelyst is, although I can't say that will hold for the future. I enjoy some level of RNG as it creates variance, but the randomness means a higher chance of losing due to bad luck.\r\n\r\nI find competitive play on the ranked ladders for both Duelyst and Hearthstone to be about the same. I'm not saying either meta is healthy, but as I see it there are more viable decks in Duelyst ladder as compared to HS.\r\n\r\nSince I've already spent a bunch of money in MTG, I don't like spending money on digital card games. So for both HS and Duelyst, I am strictly free-to-play (F2P). Both games offer similar monetization models (pay money for booster packs/cosmetics) but I was able to get further up the ladder in competitive Duelyst.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1725\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201701311923161.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201701311923161.jpg 1920w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201701311923161-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201701311923161-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201701311923161-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/201701311923161-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px\" /\r\n\r\nIn my first full month (December), I was already able to get to Duelyst's Gold Division. This should be similar to around rank 10 in HS. After a lot (and I mean a lot) of grinding from Diamond rank, I managed to hit the S-Rank Division last month. This is the equivalent of HS's Legend rank. The highest rank I ever got in HS was around rank 6 or 7.\r\n\r\nIf I think Duelyst is more skill-based than HS, why did I find it easier to get to S-Rank than HS's Legend rank? Two reasons come to mind:\r\n\r\n  I found Duelyst games more fun. This means I was playing Duelyst on a daily basis since it started. At the start, I played regularly because I wanted to get Steam Achievement completion. But I found myself enjoying the game and continuing to play even after that. There are also a lot more variance in decks being played on the Duelyst ladder. By comparison, HS ladder seemed to be almost 50% the one best deck (used to be Midrange Shaman, nowadays Pirate Aggro... ) while the other 50% are trying to beat it.\r\n  It was easier to get the powerful cards and build the tier one decks in Duelyst. The pricing of packs is about the same (100 gold), but on average I could earn around 100-150 gold per day from Duelyst's quests, compared to 40-60 for HS. The drop rates for Legendaries (highest rarity in both games) is higher in Duelyst as well. Unlike HS, Legendaries in Duelyst are not restricted to one per deck, you can play as many as three. This meant you need more of them, which annoyed me at first. But I think that's counterbalanced by the higher drop rate. For comparison, I've been playing HS for more than a year and have only gotten two premium (golden) Legendaries. Three months into Duelyst and I've opened the same amount of premium (prismatic) Legendaries. (Well, this comparison may be skewed since I open more Duelyst packs due to the increased gold rate.) Another factor was the Bloodborn expansion, which you could complete by playing enough to grind 3900 gold. That expansion came out in December, and I completed the set early in January. This set gave me access to many useful cards that were important in the meta. This allowed me to build a tier one deck and reach S-Rank in January. Even after that deck was nerfed, I was also easily able to shift to another tier one deck from another faction. In HS, I still haven't found a new competitive deck after Midrange Shaman.\r\n\r\nThe Future\r\n\r\nAt first I told myself I would stop playing Duelyst after I completed the Steam Achievements. Then I said I would stop playing after I got to S-Rank. But I'm still playing it now. By comparison, I now launch HS once or twice a week, and I don't clear the quests.\r\n\r\nDuelyst is still a young game -- the second expansion just came out last December. So in the future it may yet be plagued with the problems Hearthstone currently has. The developers have shown themselves to be responsive in nerfing problematic cards and shaking up the meta though. Whether they are able to keep this up remains to be seen. In the meantime, I'm willing to keep playing as long as the game is still enjoyable.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2016/05/hearthstone-vs-mtg/\r\n [2]: http://store.steampowered.com/app/429680/\r\n [3]: http://store.steampowered.com/app/531640/\r\n [4]: https://duelyst.com/\r\n [5]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20161015104936_1.jpg\r\n [6]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/20170216154217_1.jpg\r",

The bot tweets out a trivia question once every&nbsp;hour. It will then award points to the first five people who gave the correct answer.&nbsp;The bot will only recognize answers given as a direct reply to the tweet with the question, and only those submitted within the one hour period.\r\n\r\nSome technical details:\r\n\r\nMy scripting language of choice for the past few years has been Python 2.7. I'm using Tweepy&nbsp;to interact with the Twitter API, PyMySQL&nbsp;to connect&nbsp;to the database, and Flask&nbsp;to run the webapp.&nbsp;I haven't used Flask in some time, but it's still very straightforward. I actually had a harder time configuring the webapp&nbsp;with mod_wsgi on my host.\r\n\r\nThe main problem with a trivia system is that you need a large and high-quality set of questions.&nbsp;Right now the bot is using a small trivia set --around a thousand questions I got from a variety of sources.&nbsp;If I want to leave this bot running for a while, I'm going to need a much larger trivia set. However, reviewing and collating the questions is a nontrivial task. Hopefully I can add new questions every so often.\r\n\r\nFeel free to follow the bot and help test it out.

        "content": "---\r\nauthor: roy\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2017-02-09 01:30:50\r\ntags:\r\nSoftware Development\r\ntitle: Working with Client-Server Programs\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2017/02/working-with-client-server-programs/\r\n---\r\n\r\nBack when I was starting out as a software developer, webapps weren't really a thing. Not as much as they are now anyway. My company provided training to new hires, but I didn't get any web development training at the time, even though they already had a few web development projects in play at the time.\r\n\r\nInstead my initial training involved mostly development of so-called client-server software. This was software that was installed and run on the client machine but they would connect to a remote database server. Up until the early 2000s most enterprisey-type systems used these kinds of program.\r\n\r\nI was trained in using mostly two tools:  Borland Delphi and Oracle Forms and Reports. These were the sort of tools that would have been billed as reducing the need for specialized programmers or developers. They featured drag and drop user interfaces to design forms or report layouts. The Oracle tools featured robust database integration that let you drag and drop to associate form fields to database tables and fields. Supposedly even people with minimal training would be able to do the work of application programmers.\r\n\r\nIn practice of course, the only people patient enough to work with these tools in-depth were the programmers themselves. And client requirements always eclipsed the capabilities of these tools, such that expert programmers were still needed to push the tools to their limits and beyond.\r\n\r\nTools like Oracle Forms and Reports had a lot of problems with modern software development practices. For one thing, the \"source\" files weren't actually text files. They were mostly binary format files with some PL/SQL interspersed, and could only be opened in the proprietary IDE that only Oracle provided.\r\n\r\nBinary formats meant that while they could reap some of the benefits of source control (namely version history and such), actually figuring out the differences between revisions involved opening up both versions in the IDE and comparing each item/script/setting in the two files. Doing things like global find and replace were also a pain in the ass, especially in systems that had hundreds of forms. It was so bad I remember spending some time trying to reverse engineer the binary format so that I could attempt to make some of this work easier. No dice.\r\n\r\nAnother issue was that Oracle's IDEs were notoriously buggy. Their Reports IDE in particular often had me incensed. If you dragged the wrong thing to the other wrong thing, you would crash the IDE entirely. In fact, we had a list of things to avoid doing that would crash the entire IDE entirely. The built-in text editors were so bad, I often had a entirely separate text editor open in a separate window so I could copy-paste PL/SQL code there for any complicated edits. (Back then we were for some reason fond of Crimson Editor although it wasn't as full-featured as UltraEdit or as reliable with updates as Notepad++) This was actually also sometimes a problem as some versions of the Reports IDE also had a crash on paste.\r\n\r\nMost of my first two years of work involved maintenance of Oracle Forms-based systems (with some Delphi work thrown in occasionally). I didn't get an introduction to web development until late into the second year of my career. I was so impressed with web development I made a mock-up of one of the really complicated screens from one of our Oracle Forms projects and it seemed so pretty. I secretly hoped we could convince our clients to port them over to a web application. (1) No dice again; and (2) I probably would have regretted such a thing.\r\n\r\nI know I would have regretted it because some number of years later, we got a project to migrate an existing client-server system to a web application. The original application was written in Powerbuilder. I figured it was a fairly straightforward reverse-engineer and implement as a webapp, but nooooo. One of the higher-ups decided that to save on costs, we should look into attempting to automate the porting process somehow. We were to write translation software that would take the Powerbuilder source and convert it into the appropriate web application screens.\r\n\r\nThis was ridiculous for a good number of reasons, but as a tech lead, I had to look into it and had to prove it was in fact not viable (Spoiler alert: it was not). The first concern was that Powerbuilder also had a binary format. This was solved when I found that someone had already written a tool to export Powerbuilder binaries into some kind of text format. It was a bit crude, but it was a way forward.\r\n\r\nThe second concern is that client-server form behaviors do not map well to web applications. My favorite example of this is editable grids. These are some kind of excel-like grids that were commonplace in client-side systems. And when users upgrade their legacy systems to web apps, they inevitably expect that their editable grids should work the exact same way on the web as they did on the client-side forms.\r\n\r\nBack then Javascript-backed editable grids were still in their infancy, and each one we tried had their own sets of problems and limitations which would lead to some number of client complaints. Some clients even wanted editable grids that could accept copy-pastes from excel! Yeah, we had to develop Google Sheets! I personally had to roll my own editable grid framework from scratch at least once too. I ranted so often against client's editable grid requirements that a few developers often quoted something I said in one of our internal chat rooms:\r\n\r\n jaeger you say \"editable grid\" i hear \"problems\"\r\n\r\nAnyway yeah, porting client-side behavior to a web framework would not have been straightforward. At least not to the way our internal web development framework liked to do things. In order to have any kind of reasonable mapping, I would have needed to build some kind of Javascript rich-client framework (or see which ones of the emerging ones we could use). That also meant rewriting a lot of the backend code to support a bunch of new operations. It was a lot more work than the expected output of \"a series of steps to easily or automatically migrate PowerBuilder source code to web applications.\"\r\n\r\nWhen I raised that the idea was not viable, I was asked to give a more detailed explanation. This involved taking one of the more complex Powerbuilder source files, putting it into an Excel, and line-by-line explaining how and why that line could or could not be translated into a web application. As an alternative option to an automated porting program they wanted a guide or process so simple that even junior developers with minimal experience could follow the guide and port the programs quickly. I think they eventually went with this approach. (Which was closer to our normal reverse-engineer-and-reimplement methodology.)\r\n\r\nThese days web applications are the norm and client-server programs are a thing of the past. They were relics of a different age. The browser is our universal client now, on the desktop at least. On mobile, \"apps\" are effectively client-server programs, though they have a different set of advantages and limitations. Maybe in the future mobile apps will converge as well, into a unified browser client -- although probably mobile browsers need to be more feature-rich before this convergence can take place. My historical disdain for client-server programs carries over to mobile apps though -- I don't like to use too many of them, although that is a story for another blog post.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.crimsoneditor.com/\r\n [2]: http://www.ultraedit.com/\r",

But of course, it has to be ten thousand meaningful hours of practice. Meaningful here means that you are actually learning something from your practice. If you are repeating the same hour ten thousand times, that's not worth very much.\r\n\r\nInstead, we should be actively learning while we practice. This means identifying our weak points and learning how we can improve. It requires that we have a feedback loop that tells us whether we are doing well or not. It also means taking on bigger and more challenging tasks. Only then can we walk the path to expertise.\r\n\r\nAs an example, I've been posting on this blog on a regular basis since 2016. Aside from that, I've also been trying to write fiction in my spare time. So I figure I'm getting a lot of writing practice and I'm doing well, right?\r\n\r\nI recently took an online exam about how well I would do in editing work. Now, I'm pretty confident in my grammar and spelling, so it was no surprise that I got perfect scores in those categories. Yet I got poor scores in diction and sentence parallelism and style and such things. My overall score was still above average, but the test highlighted some weaknesses that I can work on.\r\n\r\nTo help with those, I've started going through the Chicago Manual of Style. It's a bit boring, especially near the start, but I'm learning a lot. I also found out about this webapp Hemingway which scores your writing for readability issues. I've found it pretty useful -- already I can see that my blog posts use way too many adverbs and have a lot of hard-to-read sentences.  My 2016 Nanowrimo manuscript got a higher score on this app compared to my posts though. (But I'm not proud of that work for nontechnical reasons haha). I'm also looking into a few other tools that can give me some feedback on how good my writing is.\r\n\r\nThe best feedback of course, would be from those of you who for some reason deign to read my posts. I already corrected my tendency to not end paragraphs with punctuation since someone called me out on it. So I would appreciate any further feedback about how I write and where I can improve.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.hemingwayapp.com/\r",

Yet I've worked as a software developer for more than a decade now. Literally zero times have I needed to write a sorting function or balance a BST.\r\n\r\nI have a rudimentary understanding of some sorting algorithms (mostly just bubble sort and selection sort), and I have some idea of how to balance a BST. And if I needed to implement any of those I could probably whip something up after a few tries. (Something buggy and/or inefficient probably.) If I had to interview at a company that used one of these whiteboard interviews, there's a good chance I wouldn't pass.\r\n\r\nFor maybe 90% (or even as high as 99%) of modern-day programming work, it simply isn't needed to know these things by heart. Those skills are more necessary if you're doing low level things like writing an OS or a graphics driver or such. For everyday web development or Java or Rails or whatever, it's an indulgence. And even for those instances that you need them, well, the internet is right there.\r\n\r\nI'm not a fan of the idea that not knowing data structures and algorithms means you aren't a real software developer. I have a couple of developer friends who jokingly refer to themselves as \"fake devs\". It's supposed to mean someone who doesn't have any formal computer science background and has at best a passing familiarity with data structures, algorithms, and other computer science concepts. As one of them stated \"I wouldn't know how to make a map without using a map.\" (I thought about writing a post about that, but it's surprisingly easy -- just look it up.). One of them even asked me to give them a quick crash course in data structures and algorithms because he was applying in a large and well-known software company.\r\n\r\nFor me, this term is silly. If you're doing software development work, then you're a software developer.\r\n\r\nI'm not saying knowledge of these things isn't useful. If you want to do more complicated work it is certainly useful to have these tools in your toolbox. Knowing them also makes you more flexible and expands your thinking. And certainly one should be the type of developer who is willing to seek out that knowledge if it turns out you need to use it.\r\n\r\nBut the problems with the whiteboard interviewing process isn't that they require knowledge of these things; it's that they require it under pressure, off the top of your head, without access to the internet. This doesn't reflect how programming work happens in the real world, where you often have a team, an IDE, and even the entire internet to help you.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it's often far too costly for companies to evaluate you under real-world conditions, so many resort to this common interviewing process. After all, it is difficult to evaluate the performance of even developers you have been working with for months, what more someone who just whipped up a short function on a whiteboard in twenty minutes? We tried some variations on it at our last company, but for me it is a problem yet unsolved. Maybe someday... \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ifyouwanttobea_programmerintheUSyougettodoimmigrationandtechinterviewatthesametime_.jpg\r",

Unfortunately I didn't make it past the qualifying round.\r\n\r\nI was a bit luckier in 2008 and 2010, making it to round 2 both times. In fact in 2008 as I recall I was one of only two participants from the Philippines who made it to round 2, which allowed me to jokingly brag about being the #2 programmer in the country.\r\n\r\nI registered again a few times after that, and tried again last year (2016), where I only made it to round 1.\r\n\r\nI'm no stranger to programming competitions, although the GCJ was the only one I've ever really participated in. Back in college, one of my friends usually joined such competitions, and I had a good time going over some of the problems with him.\r\n\r\nProgramming competitions don't usually reflect the kind of programming done in most real-world jobs (although it might be interesting to use competitive programming problems in whiteboard interviews and see what happens). They focus on pushing the boundaries of the programmers talents in problem solving. You also need to be fairly familiar with algorithmic approaches to searching, sorting, and so on. Having a decent background in math also helps a lot.\r\n\r\nThe Google Code Jam in particular focuses on scaling up your code to handle very large amounts of data -- well past the integer limit sometimes. Each question usually has a small and a large input. For the large inputs, you only have a short amount of time (I think it was 5 minutes?) to submit the output. Presumably you wrote and tested your code before starting the timer, so the short time is really only for your code's execution. You can afford to be inefficient or maybe even brute force your way through the small input, but if you want to solve the large inputs on time you have to be able to optimize your approach.\r\n\r\nWhen I first signed up, I dreamed of winning the entire thing (and of course being able to brag about being the best programmer in the world). But realistically, a lot of the people joining these competitions are \"pros\" more or less, so the chance of a \"casual\" like me winning are not that high. They are \"pros\" not in the sense that they do it for a living, but more of they do a lot of these competitions and regularly practice for them. Websites like TopCoder provide such competitions regularly for those who are interested. Also, I feel like I am very old and rusty, having worked too long in web development stuff where my focus is usually on a different kind of problem.\r\n\r\nStill, I think it's a good idea for programmers of all skill levels to give it a try, just to see where you are at. Who knows, you might even make it all the way! The next Google Code Jam starts soon -- the qualification round is on Apr 7. I signed up, although I'm unsure if I will have the time this year even if I advance, due to scheduling problems. But a man can still dream, right? Who knows, maybe I'll see some of you there too in the final round!\r\n\r\n [1]: https://code.google.com/codejam/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/2008/08/google-code-jam-2008/\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/2017/03/fake-devs-and-whiteboard-interviews/\r",

With its wide, spacious streets and strangely uniform city blocks, we walked around a lot. During one of our tourist days, we decided to eat some paella on the way back to our AirBNB. Who comes to Barcelona and doesn't eat paella right?\r\n\r\nWe ended up walking for quite a while. Every time we came upon a new restaurant that served paella we would consider the price and the restaurant and would think, hey maybe we can find somewhere better or cheaper further along the way. At one point a Pinoy working in a nearby restaurant even overheard us talking about it in Tagalog and he called after us as we walked away. \"Dito, mura lang!\", but we paid him no heed.\r\n\r\nHow could we know which restaurant was the best one until we walked all the way and saw all the options? But walking all the way back to the AirBNB to see all the options meant we would go for a longer time tired and hungry, so that was obviously no good. Even worse, we may find at the end of the walk that the best choice was too far back and we end up with a suboptimal paella. At some point, we would have to decide that \"Okay, the paella here looks good enough, let's eat here.\"\r\n\r\nI thought it was kind of a metaphor for life and choices and such. You can't know ahead of time whether the options presented to you now are the best you'll ever get. But at some point you have to stop browsing and overthinking and decide to settle for something that is \"good enough\". Sometimes it turns out great, sometimes it ends poorly, but it's almost always a gamble. Life decisions are only hard if we make them hard. But as long as you made the best decision with your limited information, I think you can always choose to live without regret.\r\n\r\nWe ended up eating at this small diner near our AirBNB. It was run by an Asian dude and his family, though it seemed they spoke better Spanish than they did Chinese or whatever. I had the Valencian paella which had meat instead of seafood or whatever (no surprise for anyone who knows my dietary habits.) I don't know whether it was the best or the cheapest paella we could have eaten that day, but I could tell you it was pretty damn good anyway.",

This review will have minor spoilers.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mxS7hvb.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\r\n\r\nStory\r\n\r\nFFXV follows the story of Noctis, prince of Lucis and his band of brothers (okay they're not really brothers, but they might as well be). They're supposed to be on a road trip to get Noctis married, but things happen along the way and eventually they have to figure out how to liberate their homeland from The Evil Empire. That's the backstory.\r\n\r\nThe story as presented in the game has a few problems. There's a lot of significant back story and goings-on that happen off-camera:\r\n\r\n  There's both a feature-length movie (Kingsglaive) and a six-episode anime (Brotherhood) that expounds on the four main characters' backgrounds and how the current political situation got to where it is\r\n  There's supposedly a whole effort by minor characters like Cor to organize a resistance against the Empire, but we're never really exposed to it\r\n  Then there's Lunafreya, Noctis' betrothed, who goes off and does her own stuff to try to undermine the Empire and supposedly help Noctis, but for most of the game it's never really explained what exactly she's doing or how it's relevant\r\n  One of your friends, Gladio, goes off on a short sidequest of his own and vanishes for a while, and it's never explained WTH that was about. Presumably it will be covered in a future DLC.\r\n\r\nAnother problem is that Noctis and the gang spend most of the game sort of lollygagging around enjoying their road trip without much sense of urgency. Understandably they wanted to present an open world this time (since much of the criticism of FFXIII was for its linearity), but the problem is that the open world is filled with a lot of frivolous things that don't seem particularly urgent given the fate of the world being at stake. I mean, the party spends a lot of time camping out, cooking food, fishing, taking pictures, driving around looking for auto parts, and so on. The sense of urgency is not apparent.\r\n\r\nI suppose the lack of urgency is an acceptable trade-off for the open world, but even for the supposed main story quests in the earlier chapters, it's not immediately clear how they serve to help you overcome the Empire. I feel like there should have been more story quests related to helping establish a resistance and so on.\r\n\r\nThe later chapters narrow down the open world significantly, and the second half of the game takes place outside the main continent where there is significantly less freedom to explore. It feels a bit like they spent a lot of their design budget on the open world half and so just restricted the second half to the meaty story parts. Reminds me a bit of Xenogears disc 2!\r\n\r\nOne of the chapters near the end was also executed very poorly. To establish a sense of tension, most of the systems you had been relying on throughout the game are taken away from you. While this would have been okay for a short segment, the chapter goes on a bit too long and ends up being far too tedious.\r\n\r\nI did find myself surprised by events leading up to the final chapter, although I felt like it was another wasted opportunity. The final chapter gives us a glimpse at a different version of the open world but never really let us see most of it.\r\n\r\nThe ending itself was bittersweet (and easily trolled haha), but I found it an acceptable ending.\r\n\r\nCharacters\r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http://i.imgur.com/RTcRL3u.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\r\n\r\nWhile I found the main cast of Noctis, Ignis, Gladio and Prompto to have engaging personalities, they don't really have much backstory in-game (most of the character backstories are in Brotherhood). In fact, later on, a startling revelation is made about one of them and none of them really bat an eye at all. It was in the sense of \"hey, we don't care about that, we're your friends,\" but it still felt like something that should have been explored further.\r\n\r\nThe interaction among the group is great though. They regularly banter and tease each other even during combat. It really felt like they were a group of long-time friends.\r\n\r\n*Combat *\r\n\r\nI'm an old-school FF fan, so I'll be the first to admit I miss ye olde active time battle. FFXV's battles take place entirely in real-time, with the player controlling Noctis and the other characters controlled by AI. The AI control goes about as well as you could expect, they do fine against weak enemies but against tougher battles you find yourself constantly having to help them with potions or other items. You can command them to do special attacks when available, and they will participate in combo attacks when possible, but for the most part it's just Noctis warping and striking.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http://imgur.com/iEmsTOE.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\r\n\r\nCombat is fluid and there's a lot of movement and jumping around and looking for opportunities to strike from behind. Early on you are discouraged from wandering around at night as the enemies might be too high level, but the combat system is set up such that most tough battles can be overcome simply by having enough recovery items around. I only got a game over once, early in the game when didn't know what I was doing and I tried wandering at night and promptly got squashed by an iron giant.\r\n\r\nThe Open World\r\n\r\nThe open world gives the party a lot to do. There's \"hunts\" dished out by people in diners (basically quests to go kill a specific bunch of monsters) and other side quests given out by various characters. There's a fishing minigame, because apparently it's a hobby of Noctis. The fishing minigame is okay, except I didn't have the patience to try to get the most difficult fish.\r\n\r\nThen there's the photos and the food porn. A lot of pandering to the modern-day youths here, I'm surprised instagram hasn't been invented in their world. Cooking is Ignis' specialty, and the game renders each dish really well, sometimes enough to make you hungry.\r\n\r\nAnd the photos are the specialty of Prompto. It's one of those things that feels really frivolous in the game. Every time you camp you can browse pictures that Prompto has taken so you can save them for later viewing. A later patch provided a photo mode that you can control directly. There's an entire reddit thread about how players have snapped more pics for this game than for their own vacations!\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'm no exception. Exporting a lot of photos is a pain though, as there is no batch export option in-game. Here are a sampling of the photos I got (a bunch of them are from achievements):\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/ECX4J\"\r\n  a href=\"https://imgur.com/a/ECX4J\"View post on imgur.com/a\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nAchievements\r\n\r\nSpeaking of achievements, I was a touch disappointed with FFXV's achievement set. I got the Platinum trophy, but I felt like it was a bit too easy, as there was still a lot of things to do in the game outside of the achievements. I don't want annoying grindy achievements, but I don't want them to be too easy and \"no challenge\" either.\r\n\r\nOther stuff\r\n\r\nThey had this weird Chocobo carnival DLC that somehow takes place in another timeline or something LOL. IDK how it works.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http://imgur.com/2Uj1VM3.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that the more action-oriented combat system is indicative of where SE plans to take the series moving forward, there's still a significant amount of nostalgia in the game for old-schoolers to appreciate. Callouts range from Prompto humming the classic victory fanfare after the battle to 2d sprites in the store menus jumping up in down to indicate which characters can equip each item. Classic FF beasties like the Malboro still make an appearance (and are still a pain to fight!)\r\n\r\nThe weirdest thing overall has to be the Cup Noodles thing! They had some sort of tie-up with Nissin and Cup Noodles is one of the meals your party can have in the game and Gladio is obsessed with them. Later on you even get a quest to try to find a way to improve on Cup Noodles and it ends with the characters saying there's really no beating the original since it has a perfect mix of ingredients already. I feel like the VA's really enjoyed doing those lines haha.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"alignnone size-full\" src=\"http://imgur.com/MDiYsIS.png\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\" /\r\n\r\nOverall\r\n\r\nOkay, I had a bunch of complaints and nitpicks but to be honest, I enjoyed the game. There was a lot of gameplay, some seriously though battles and some annoying dungeons that took forever, but I finished most of it and got the platinum in under a month. Nowadays for an RPG that's very quick for me, an indication of how much I liked the game. There's a bunch more content planned for it, including DLC story packs for each of the other main characters, and high-end boss fights and what not. Not sure if I'd still play those since there's a lot more RPGs on the horizon (2017 is a good year for RPG gamers.) But if Final Fantasy XV is the next step for the series moving forward, I find it acceptable.",

I don't appreciate the idea of paying money to get surprised by jump scares or whatever.\r\n\r\nBack when I was a kid I remember my dad watching a Betamax copy of The Gate back home and me and my younger brother were watching with him and the movie seriously creeped me out. There was this one scene where a demonic eye manifested on the lead kid's palm and that scene stuck with me for a while. (Maybe some latent form of trypophobia -- don't google it.)\r\n\r\nSlasher movies I find a bit more acceptable -- I watched a few of them in the 90s like Scream and I Know What You Did Last Summer. But the really creepy stuff like _The Ring _and similar films I'm not particularly interested in.\r\n\r\nFor scary video games, we played a few of them back on the PC when we were young. The most memorable would definitely be Waxworks, a kind of point-and-click with first-person grid-exploration horror game. I remember my brother and I would play it late at night while the folks were out. There was one time we had to stop because we had been surprised at the sudden appearance of some bad guy in the pyramid stage. We had to turn off the PC and run out to the _sari-sari _store so that we had some people to talk to. We eventually managed to finish this game, but I think after that part we refrained from playing too late in the night. LOL.\r\n\r\nI also played the original jump scare game, Alone in the Dark although I never got into the succeeding series like Resident Evil. These days I don't bother with scary games anymore. Sometimes I consider playing stuff like Amnesia, but I'm sure even if I'm a grown-up I'd still get creeped out by some of the stuff and that's not really how I like to be entertained.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheGate(1987_film)\r",

To be honest&nbsp;I wasn't sure about using this blog to participate in a promo, but I was already in the market for a new TV since our&nbsp;living room TV is already starting to have some problems.\r\n\r\nI checked out the product features of the Sony X8000D Bravia on their website. Some of the features stood out for me specifically:\r\n\r\n  4K HDR -- this means you get to watch high definition 4k videos. Perfect for those who really enjoy high quality displays. The TV also comes with some technologies to enhance your viewing experience such as 4k X-Reality and Triluminos display.&nbsp;And if you have a gamer in the family, this means you can now maximize the Playstation 4 Pro since it supports gaming in 4K resolution!\r\n  Connectivity -- Wifi is a big deal for me because our current TV is a bit old and only supports wired connection. Wifi makes it a lot easier! The TV also has 4 HDMI slots -- let me see...  that's one each for the PS4 Pro, Nintendo Switch, and XBox One, plus one more to spare for those times when you want to connect your laptop to a big&nbsp;display&nbsp;(one can dream right?)\r\n  Android TV -- this means all the apps on the Google Play store can be downloaded and run on the TV. That means built-in Youtube, Netflix, etc, without need for a&nbsp;separate device to stream from!\r\n  Google Cast -- oh, I didn't know this even existed until now! Apparently TV's can now have Chromecast functionality built-in, without the need for the separate Chromecast device. Awesome! We can just send content from our mobile devices&nbsp;directly to the TV!\r\n  Netflix recommended -- one of the things I've been looking for in a new TV is that I want my folks to be able to easily use my Netflix account. Currently the only way they can use it on the TV is through the PS4, which is a bit difficult if you don't know your way around a controller. Having the TV itself support Netflix will make it a lot easier for my parents to take advantage of Netflix's library of movies and TV shows!\r\n  X-Protection PRO -- to protect against power surges, this seems like it would be really good especially here in Metro Manila where power supply is not always the most stable. Added protection for your investment!\r\n\r\nThe model has a lot of other features designed to enhance your enjoyment of audio and video content. With all of these features, the Sony Bravia X8000D&nbsp;could definitely be the perfect home entertainment companion for the modern family!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.yugatech.com/tv/giveaway-win-this-4k-hdr-sony-bravia-x8000d-with-android-tv/\r",

Lots of funny gags and one-liners\r\n  I felt like some of the character/background development stuff was pushed a bit too hard as well\r\n  the movie's plot also felt a bit thin and straightforward. I mean, you could see some of the major plot points coming a mile away. Maybe from the trailers even\r\n  Star Lord was ok. Gamora/Nebula felt poorly written. Rocket was a bit annoying. Drax and Mantis were ok, although the space they have for Mantis' character overlaps with Drax a bit. I'm still not super happy with how Drax and Gamora are characterized in the MCU.\r\n  I'm less happy with this movie's soundtrack compared to the first one\r\n  Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Certainly not. In fact, she chose to derp around the mall instead of coming with me and my cousin to watch.\r\n  IMAX or not: Some visuals used the 3d effect, but nothing too exaggerated or critical. I'd say IMAX optional, but it definitely adds something to some scenes.\r\n  There are five extra scenes near the credits (one of them is right before the credits roll, so I can't really say \"post-credit\" screens). Most of them are just setting the tone for the inevitable GOTG3\r\n  Additionally, just pay attention to the background of the credits roll as well, it's great\r\n  While I felt the movie was ok, it's kind of just more of the same of what we got with the first movie, which felt a lot stronger overall\r\n\r\nSpoilers follow:\r\n\r\n  It would have been silly to expect Ego the Living Planet to have his Marvel comics appearance of a planet with a face, but guess what, we actually got it!\r\n  Stallone as Starhawk and Yondu being officially a member of the \"original Guardians\" team was great. Oh and apparently Michael Rosenbaum was Martinex!\r\n  The Stan Lee cameo here was really meant to push the \"Stan Lee has been playing the same character in all his cameos\" narrative\r\n  Giving Peter a Zune was a cruel joke on Microsoft's expense, but sets us up for more music (maybe from later decades even!) for the 3rd movie\r\n  Lots of random other Marvel fan-service cameo appearances too: Watchers, Cosmo, Howard the Duck, and I'm sure I missed/forgot quite a lot more\r\n\r\n&nbsp;",

And I had to proxy for her daughter's ninong and maybe give a few words on what it means to become an adult. My first two reactions were (1) wow I'm so old one of my batchmates has an eighteen-year-old daughter; and (2) what the heck would I know about becoming an adult? (I guess (3) was \"oh, it's a debut, so it's formal and I have to dress up? I hate dressing up.\")\r\n\r\nI mean, don't get me wrong. I certainly consider myself an adult. But I have no idea when that transitioned happened. It's not like when you turn eighteen you get some kind of brain implant that magically tells you how to live life and be independent and get a job and be responsible and do your taxes and all that stuff.\r\n\r\nIf anything, I would say \"becoming an adult\" is a continuing task that keeps going on even when you're nearing the big four-oh and beyond. I guess the zeitgeist is already aware of this though, given how we've coined the word \"adulting\", which basically means doing stuff that makes you feel like an adult. Like going to the bank. Or signing contracts. Or even dressing up to go to a formal event.\r\n\r\nWhile we were having dinner at the event, I jokingly said I should just give a message like \"fake it til you make it.\" I basically feel that's what most of adulthood is: bumbling along until you figure out what the heck you're doing. When you're a kid you look up to the grown-ups who can go out and do anything they want and confidently do all these jobs and they know everything. But when you grow up you realize that's not really how it works -- most of the time all the adults are struggling through life too, trying to figure out whatever thing they have to do that day, or even just trying to make it to the next paycheck. And you're definitely going to miss being a kid. Maybe that's the sign that you're already an adult, when you already miss being a kid?\r\n\r\nI ended up reading a few words from the actual ninong, so I didn't get to give my own adulthood message. One of my other batchmates gave the debutante a copy of The Art of War as a gift, with the message that adulthood is basically warfare so she should be prepared. While I agree with that sentiment somewhat, I think for me the most important thing about becoming an adult would be learning to find your own voice and identity. That means figuring out what's important to you and what values you hold. Being an adult isn't easy, but knowing yourself in this way gives you a framework to guide you in your adulting decisions.",

I got busy for a while and had to skip a few weeks, and then general laziness prevented me from resuming a regular posting schedule. (Hopefully that ends now.) Most of the time my ranting was on social media, which got me thinking: Is writing on your own blog still useful in this day and age of social media?\r\n\r\nI've been blogging for a long time -- my archives say 2002 -- waaay before Facebook or even Twitter came around. If for some reason you felt like digging through my older posts you'd find that I kind of used the blog like Twitter or FB: I'd have some short posts, updates about what's going on, share some links, and so on. These days we have social media for that, so why blog at all?\r\n\r\nWell, social media is a perfectly valid channel to post your thoughts obviously. But I feel like blogging serves a different purpose. And when I say blogging, I mean on a platform dedicated to blogging, preferably on your own server.\r\n\r\nHere are the obvious differences/advantages of blogging:\r\n\r\n  Blogs are publicly accessible commentary. Contrast this with Facebook, which I use mostly for interacting only with family and friends. I sometimes make some FB posts public, but mostly on request because people want to share it. It would make more sense for me to have such content on the blog so that people can share it directly without me having to fiddle with post privacy settings on FB.\r\n  Blogs are long-form. Contrast this with Twitter's post-length limitation and even Facebook where I also tend to spout out one-liners or short paragraphs. I like a blog post for longer, more detailed content. Twitter users use workarounds like the \"1/N\" format to post longer text content, but I'm not really a big fan of that.\r\n  A blog should contain your own content. Contrast this with almost all social media where your own content is interspersed with retweets, shares, reblogs, and so on.\r\n  Blogs are searchable, either using your internal search form (I have one on the sidebar!) or via Google search. It's a bit annoying sometimes trying to scroll through your FB or Twitter timeline trying to find something.\r\n  The above point means social media posts feel a lot more...  ephemeral, maybe? I consider blog posts a lot more \"permanent\", while social media are more of \"at this point in time.\"\r\n  Blogs are under your control. You're not subject to someone else's moderation. Of course that also means you're on your own if you get DDOS'ed or such hehe. Well, there's pros and cons of course.\r\n  You can still push your blog content to your other social media channels. I have systems set up to push my blog posts to Twitter, Facebook and Tumblr.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the various social media channels have their pros too, so I still use them for various purposes. (I thought about splitting this blog post into two, but I literally just wrote about long-form content, so let's try to justify that a bit!)\r\n\r\n  Facebook -- I use this mainly to interact with friends and family and for sharing family pictures. There was a thread on reddit a while back about how a lot of people recommend quitting FB (or even social media altogether) since it's not good for your self-esteem to be always checking how other people are doing. I find that this is really only an issue for people who already have low self-esteem and feel a need to compare themselves to other people (I guess teenagers mostly?). I don't have any such issues. I like seeing how my friends are doing even if they're people I don't see often anymore and it gives you good convo material when you randomly run into them. I also tend to share on FB things I know will interest my friends and family, or at least some subgroup of them: family pictures, tech stuff, hobby stuff (gaming/MTG/comics), cat pictures, puns, memes, etc. I try not to dive into public groups too much, since FB has a low barrier of entry, the content/discussion is not that good IMO. My public Facebook profile is here.\r\n  Twitter -- my twitter stream is public. I use it for interacting with strangers. (Sophie Turner never replied to me that one time!). Twitter has a higher barrier of entry compared to FB, so the discussion is a bit higher quality. When posting to Twitter, it's typically a stream of consciousness thing for me -- I just randomly decide to post things. On FB I tend to filter myself a bit as I don't want to be too spammy, but on Twitter, I spam away about what I'm doing. If I'm playing in a big Magic tournament I'll probably be tweeting every round about my horrible misplays. I will oft tweet about games I'm playing, books I'm reading, and so on. Same philosophy applies to sharing/retweeting: it's a lot more impulsive, I'll just share anything that looks interesting. My twitter feed is basically my FB feed except with less pics of people I know and more random thoughts throughout the day. If that sounds like your kind of thing, my twitter profile is here.\r\n  Instagram -- quick story about how I got an instagram account. I tried to create one but found out that someone had already registered an account using my email. Of course I went ahead and used password recovery to take control of the account. It wasn't very active so he probably didn't mind, although I think some of his followers still follow me lol. I mostly post pics of food, board games, sketches, or random things I buy. You can view my instagram here.\r\n  Reddit -- I use reddit more for content consumption. It can be shallow sometimes, but you can also find some good/witty/insightful convos. If I want to find some discussion about recent events or tv shows or movies, reddit is always a good place to look. The barrier to entry here is very high, so discussion tends to be higher quality than either FB or Twitter. (Still lots of shitposting though, that's the internet for you.) I don't publicly acknowledge my reddit profile, but it's very easy to find haha.\r\n  Tumblr -- just random odds and ends. It's not very important, but I do have it. I used to use it only to reshare tumblr content I found amusing, but these days I also push sketches and blog posts to my tumblr.\r\n  LinkedIn -- terrible! I'm not a fan of LinkedIn, as it seems to be mainly a way to get harassed by recruiters who didn't even bother reading my profile. Still, it occasionally has a use so I keep it around and update my profile sometimes.\r\n  Quora -- I've been reading Quora for a while now but recently also started answering questions every so often as a bit of writing practice.\r\n\r\nTakeaways: Blogging is great, even if you're already using social media. Try it out! Social media has its place too, but don't let it control your life!\r\n\r\n [1]: https://www.facebook.com/stephen.roy.tang\r\n [2]: https://twitter.com/roytang\r\n [3]: https://www.instagram.com/roytang0400\r\n [4]: http://tumblr.roytang.net/\r\n [5]: https://www.linkedin.com/in/roytang/\r\n\r\nComments\r\n\r\n Comment by Ryan Biddulph on 2017-06-06 21:32:42 +0000\r\nHi Roy,\r\n\r\nGood points all around.

But when there's a local Grand Prix, oldies like me crawl out of the woodwork and try to believe we can still do well in a tournament with minimal prep. Grand Prix Manila 2017 was to be Standard format, held on June 2-4, 2017, at the SMX convention center.\r\n\r\nAt the start of the year I already knew I would be playing in this year's GP Manila, but since I hadn't played Standard for well over a year, I didn't really know what I would be playing. But I started keeping track of what decks there were in the metagame. Sadly, the meta was not so good, with an oppressive combo deck dominating the field. Like many others, I assumed there would be a ban at some point, which means I couldn't commit to a deck too early.\r\n\r\nI only decided on a deck after the B&R announcement shortly before the release of Amonkhet. At that point, looking at the available cards we had, I settled on trying to put together the Temur Marvel deck. It took me a couple of weeks to put the deck together, then I ran it through an FNM and a couple of other smaller tournaments. I was satisfied enough to play it for the grinders on Friday, Day 0 of GP Manila.figure id=\"attachment_2013\" style=\"width: 500px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-2013\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/contentulamogceaseless1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"500\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/contentulamogceaseless1.jpg 500w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/content_ulamogceaseless1-300x180.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"If you're playing Standard this year, you're familiar with this guy/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nDay 0 -- Friday, June 2\r\n\r\nAs I'm from Quezon City, the venue is quite far, and to be honest I was a bit stressed out at the idea of commuting to SMX three days in a row. But still I went. I started out determined to play as many Standard grinders as a I could on Day 0, both to up my chance of earning byes for the GP and to give me more familiarity with my deck. Unfortunately, things did not go so well. I ended up 2-6 for the day, not even earning any prize points. I played quite a few mirror matches, something I hadn't been able to do in my previous tests. It gave me some insights so even though I came home late that night, I stayed up late tweaking the main deck and the sideboard based on what I learned during the day.\r\n\r\nDay 1 -- Saturday, June 3\r\n\r\nI woke up early and took the train. Saturday was a bit lighter commute than Friday, but not by much.\r\n\r\nThis was the deck I ran:\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist title=\"Temur Marvel\" }}\r\n  \r\n[Creatures]\r\n  \r\n4 Rogue Refiner\r\n  \r\n2 Whirler Virtuoso\r\n  \r\n2 Tireless Tracker\r\n  \r\n3 Ulamog the Ceaseless Hunger\r\n  \r\n1 Torrential Gearhulk\r\n  \r\n[/Creatures]\r\n  \r\n[Spells]\r\n  \r\n2 Chandra Flamecaller\r\n  \r\n4 Attune with Aether\r\n  \r\n1 Nissa's Renewal\r\n  \r\n4 Aetherworks Marvel\r\n  \r\n3 Woodweaver's Puzzleknot\r\n  \r\n2 Censor\r\n  \r\n1 Negate\r\n  \r\n4 Harnessed Lightning\r\n  \r\n4 Glimmer of Genius\r\n  \r\n1 Magma Spray\r\n  \r\n[/Spells]\r\n  \r\n[Lands]\r\n  \r\n4 Aether Hub\r\n  \r\n3 Botanical Sanctum\r\n  \r\n3 Spirebluff Canal\r\n  \r\n2 Lumbering Falls\r\n  \r\n2 Cinder Glade\r\n  \r\n5 Forest\r\n  \r\n2 Mountain\r\n  \r\n1 Island\r\n  \r\n[/Lands]\r\n  \r\n[Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n2 Negate\r\n  \r\n1 Dispel\r\n  \r\n1 Ceremonious Rejection\r\n  \r\n1 Manglehorn\r\n  \r\n1 Appetite for the Unnatural\r\n  \r\n2 Magma Spray\r\n  \r\n2 Sweltering Suns\r\n  \r\n1 Shielded Aether Thief\r\n  \r\n2 Tireless Tracker\r\n  \r\n1 Torrential Gearhulk\r\n  \r\n1 Baral's Expertise\r\n  \r\n[/Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\nI opted to play with Trackers in the main because I found my mirror match losses from Day 0 often came to a Tracker sticking on the opposing side. I also dropped down to 3 Ulamogs because it felt like I often got stupid hands with 2 or 3 of them.\r\n\r\nSadly, most of my tweaks didn't matter much as I performed terribly. Here's my day 1 record:\r\n\r\nR01 1-2 LOSS vs UR Kefnet Both games he won, he had the turn 3 Kefnet which I had no answer for.\r\n  \r\nR02 1-2 LOSS vs RB Hazoret. This deck is great and fun, and the matches were really close, but eventually I ran out of Marvel spins\r\n  \r\nR03 1-2 LOSS vs UW Flash. I had a Marvel, but it ran into a Spell Queller. In desperation I tried to kill the Queller while he was tapped out, spun into a second Marvel, spun again into nothing.\r\n  \r\nR04 2-0 WIN vs Monoblack Zombies\r\n  \r\nR05 0-2 LOSS vs Temur Marvel. Made the mistake of spinning on my turn when he had 6 energy. My ulamog died to his ulamog\r\n  \r\nDROP\r\n\r\nI feel like I didn't make any particularly bad plays during the first 3 rounds. The Marvel spins just didn't work out for me. I may have been already starting to feel the lack of sleep during round 5 so that's a thing. (I immediately went home to sleep after dropping.)\r\n\r\nTheir decks did seem particularly tuned towards beating Marvel. That's one of the big downsides of just netdecking the dominant deck -- everyone's gunning for you. The lack of prep time was really hard on me too. The last time I did well in a Grand Prix was GP Manila back in 2015, and that time I had been playing Jeskai for months before the GP. Unfortunately I had been caught between a rock and a hard place -- if i had assembled a deck months before it likely would have been Saheeli combo (since I used to play Twin in Modern), which meant I would have been the victim of the bannings. Ah well, can't dwell on the past too much. Have to note it for next time.\r\n\r\nWill there be a next time? On the bus ride home I was so dejected at the poor performance I wondered if I was just done with Standard forever. But I suppose it depends largely on the metagame; Marvel was pretty bad whether you were playing it or against it. In any case, I'm also somehow qualified for Nationals this year, so at the very least I'm playing Standard again in September. (Mostly because I want the promo Inkmoth Nexus)\r\n\r\nDay 2 -- Sunday, June 4\r\n\r\nI decided to come back to just play for some prizes in side events (and also because I had to return some cards I borrowed). Day two had one of my favorite side events: Chaos Sealed! I played this after scrubbing out of GP Singapore 2015, so this may become a day two tradition for me lol.\r\n\r\nFor Chaos Sealed, I got dealt the following boosters: EMA, MMA2017, BFZ, SOI, Dissension and Torment. I think I got a pretty good pool, value-wise:figure id=\"attachment_2010\" style=\"width: 720px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-2010\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Iguessmychaossealedpoolwasokaymtggpmanila.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Iguessmychaossealedpoolwasokaymtggpmanila.jpg 720w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Iguessmychaossealedpoolwasokaymtggpmanila-150x150.jpg 150w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Iguessmychaossealedpoolwasokaymtggpmanila-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"(No, I didnt dare play or shuffle the FOW)/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nMy pool was kinda light on removal, but I had like a Llanowar Elf and some basic land search and three signets, so I decided to just ramp into some Eldrazi! A number of people were shocked that I decided to run the Ulamog, and a friend even told me I'd never be able to cast it. I sent him a picture of that Ulamog ready to attack for lethal on the first game in the first round.\r\n\r\nI went 3-2 with my pool. My losses were to a Deadeye Navigator (that guy is a nightmare to get rid of) and to a deck that was almost entirely removal (I died to a Control Magic'ed Benthic Infiltrator. More like InfilTRAITOR amirite?). Not bad. I won enough points to split a box with some guys, and the FOW/ Ulamog meant I came out ahead value-wise. The sad thing about these events is that they're among the last to finish, so the prize wall is kinda cleared out by then and we weren't able to get a Kaladesh box, had to settle for Amonkhet.figure id=\"attachment_2011\" style=\"width: 720px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-2011\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gpmanilaloot.MaybenexttimeI_shouldsticktosideeventslolmtg.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gpmanila_loot._Maybe_next_time_I_should_stick_to_side_events_lolmtg.jpg 720w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gpmanilaloot.MaybenexttimeI_shouldsticktosideeventslolmtg-150x150.jpg 150w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gpmanila_loot._Maybe_next_time_I_should_stick_to_side_events_lolmtg-300x300.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"GP Manila Loot/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nCompetitively the GP was a bust for me, but at least I came away with some swag and some packs.

After that I dived into Persona 3 Portable and eventually the spin-off games Persona 4 Arena (and Ultimax) and Persona Q on 3DS. So it was no surprise that one of the game releases I was most looking forward to this year would be the next numbered game in the series: Persona 5 on the Playstation 4.\r\n\r\nLike P4G before it, the focus is on the school life of a young man forced into a new environment, interspersed with some good old JRPG dungeon crawling. You meet a ragtag group of misfits and somehow band together to save all of Japanese society from itself. Or something to that extent. This is just an excuse to dump some screens of P5, so let's get that out of the way.figure id=\"attachment_1957\" style=\"width: 1835px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1957\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-3.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1835\" height=\"1007\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-3.png 1835w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-3-300x165.png 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-3-768x421.png 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-3-1024x562.png 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-3-1200x659.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1835px) 100vw, 1835px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"That's totally his canon name in the lore./figcaption/figure figure id=\"attachment1956\" style=\"width: 1887px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"img class=\"wp-image-1956 size-full\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-2.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1887\" height=\"1009\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-2.png 1887w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-2-300x160.png 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-2-768x411.png 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-2-1024x548.png 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-2-1200x642.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1887px) 100vw, 1887px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"This game is educational, I didn't actually know this before./figcaption/figure figure id=\"attachment1959\" style=\"width: 913px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"img class=\"wp-image-1959 size-full\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-5.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"913\" height=\"407\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-5.png 913w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-5-300x134.png 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-5-768x342.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 913px) 100vw, 913px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Your teammates have the utmost respect for you as team leader./figcaption/figure figure id=\"attachment1958\" style=\"width: 1861px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"img class=\"wp-image-1958 size-full\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-4.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1861\" height=\"1009\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-4.png 1861w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-4-300x163.png 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-4-768x416.png 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-4-1024x555.png 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-4-1200x651.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1861px) 100vw, 1861px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Some of them are...  stranger than the others/figcaption/figure figure id=\"attachment1961\" style=\"width: 1845px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"img class=\"wp-image-1961 size-full\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-7.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1845\" height=\"921\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-7.png 1845w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-7-300x150.png 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-7-768x383.png 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-7-1024x511.png 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-7-1200x599.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1845px) 100vw, 1845px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"When dungeon crawling, you can summon mighty persona in battle! They're like Pokemon, only way more phallic./figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nThe JRPG side streamlines a lot of the problems from P4G: the main story dungeons are hand-built JRPG style dungeons and there are save points in between to make dying not so much of a pain. Even on normal difficulty, I still managed to die a few times -- notably to those Angel enemies that tend to suicide when low on life. And they brought back Persona negotiation! I didn't appreciate this too much in Shin Megami Tensei IV as it felt a bit obtuse there, but here the Persona's \"personality\" is shown which makes it easier to figure out the \"correct\" answers.\r\n\r\nSince you're supposed to be leading a team of thieves there's also a bit of a \"stealth system\" while dungeon crawling. It's not a very deep stealth system, basically just hide behind corners and ambush enemies to gain battle advantage. The only problem is that the camera and the controls don't always agree with your stealth plans, and sometimes the wrong button press can lead you to disaster.\r\n\r\nThe Phantom Thieves story is okay, although most of the plot is telegraphed ahead of time. I kind of liked P4G's big murder mystery where you had to figure out who among your confidants was a big &#8216;ol bad guy. Here in P5, it's painfully obvious who sold you out, even if you hadn't noticed his \"mistake\" early on. That being said, there is a surprise twist near the end that caught me by surprise.\r\n\r\nCompared to P4G, Persona 5 comes out at the height of social media, so while I like the P4G's battle theme a bit better, P5's battle music has managed to become a meme of its own:\r\n\r\n{{ youtube WUWQFnC2zqU }}\r\n\r\nI must've seen this video at least 50 times now due to some of my friends (you know who you are).\r\n\r\nOne thing I dislike about the Persona series is that because of the time management aspect of the game, a lot of things are missable. Since I tend to play RPGs without any guides or walkthroughs the first time around, it's problematic for me. This means that on my first run through I missed completing the Confidants/Social Links, even though when I started the run I told myself I'd prioritize them over other activities. Definitely need a second run for the platinum. (Of course, I have yet to platinum P4G either due to a mistake I made during the second run~)\r\n\r\nIn conclusion: Despite (or maybe because of?) it's ridiculousness, Persona 5 is a great game. Story is tight, and the dungeon crawling has been streamlined a lot. That being said, it's definitely not a game for everyone, mostly because of the style. If you dislike Japanese stuff or anime or anything turn-based, it's definitely not for you. Go play Call of Duty or something. For everyone else, enjoy one of the year's best JRPGs (sorry FF15!)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-3.png\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-2.png\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-5.png\r\n [4]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/p5-4.png\r",

It's kind of high-level and (I believe) shouldn't be too detailed. Supposedly the requirements are written by the client. For a country like the Philippines the client is \"we the sovereign Filipino people\".\r\n\r\nSlight tangent: I used to know this guy who was one of those rabid \"we need to amend the constitution\" types and he asked me to review a \"mathematical model to track the budget as a function of tax collection and monetary policy\" that he wanted to include in a proposed new constitution. I told him I didn't believe such detailed rules shouldn't be in the constitution -- that would unnecessarily tie us down to a specific model that we may or may not regret later on. I ended up declining to help him with his strange hobby.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative branch are the analysts. They make the detailed specs/laws to define how we're going to satisfy the requirements/constitution. In a real project, the client usually signs off on the specs. In government, we supposedly sign off when we vote for the legislators.\r\n\r\nThe Executive branch are the developers. They're responsible for implementing the specs/laws in order to fulfill the requirements/constitution. They can decide the technical approach to use, as long as they satisfy the specs and the requirements.\r\n\r\nThe Judiciary is the QA, they review the work of the developers/executive and make sure they're following the specs/laws and adhering to the requirements/constitution. Sometimes they even have to review the specs/laws themselves to make sure they aren't contradicting the requirements/constitution.\r\n\r\nSometimes a project is so large and you need to form smaller subteams to specialize in different areas or modules. That's called Federalism. **Or maybe **local government.\r\n\r\nSometimes one person handles specs, development and QA. That's called dictatorship.\r\n\r\nSometimes people want to rewrite or amend the requirements/constitution. That's called agile development. Or maybe scope creep.\r\n\r\nSometimes the bureaucracy needs to be reorganized to be more efficient. That's called refactoring.\r\n\r\nThe big difference between government and software projects is that in software projects, team members are selected based on meritocracy. In theory at least, you choose the best people for the job. In government, who gets the job is determined by who is best at bamboozling the largest number of people to vote them in. Maybe someday we'll get a meritocracy in government too, but until then I'm probably sticking to software development.",

I've only been here twice, but I could imagine myself living here for an extended period of time. It solves my top three problems with Metro Manila: overly hot weather, poor transportation options, and poor internet.\r\n\r\nBoth visits I found the temperatures to be within the generally agreeable range of around 5-25 degrees celsius. The low end is slightly too cold, but manageable. Of course, I haven't experienced actual Japanese winter, so it's probably colder then.\r\n\r\nTransportation is great and easy! There's like twenty lines of trains or such (OK, I didn't really count, but there's a lot!) _and a lot of buses too. The great thing is that the trains and buses run on very exact schedules. At trains stations or bus stops you'll see a list of times _to the minute telling you when the next train or bus will arrive. That kind of thing would be unheard of in Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nOne of the downsides is that the train lines can get a bit confusing. They're not all interconnected either -- there's some lines that are part of the Tokyo Metro, while some are part of JR (Japan Rail), and so on. It can cause some confusion for example some places might have both a Metro station and a JR station, and they might not be connected. The staff are always very helpful in the train stations though, feel free to ask them how to get to a particular station. They will try their best to help even if their English isn't the best. Most stations will also have helpful signage showing maps and routes and stuff, and the trains themselves will have announcers telling you what the next station is.figure id=\"attachment_1987\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"wp-image-1987 size-medium\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/12299236101542222951839122882233159207648588n1-300x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/12299236101542222951839122882233159207648588n1-300x300.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/12299236101542222951839122882233159207648588n1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/12299236101542222951839122882233159207648588n1-768x768.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/12299236101542222951839122882233159207648588_n1.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Even though most signs aren't in English, they should be fairly easy to understand/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nFor paying your transportation fares, there's a few options, but for me the best one is to use an IC card -- these are reloadable cards that you can use on any train or bus in Tokyo. _(I have no idea what IC means.) _You can get one at the airport when you arrive -- there's two providers, it's either Suica or Pasmo and you can reload them at any train station. There's also an option to get a 2-day or 3-day unlimited metro pass, which is a great idea if you plan to travel around Tokyo many times within a short period, but it only works with Metro lines which can be a bit restrictive.\r\n\r\nInternet in Tokyo is obviously very good of course. If you're staying at an Airbnb, try to get one that provides you with a mobile wifi unit you can use while wandering about. Being a tourist these days is a lot easier with internet, given google maps and similar apps. If you don't have a mobile wifi unit, you can also leech free wifi from any 7-11 or train station!\r\n\r\nThe city is also very friendly to people who like to walk -- during this last trip I managed to walk from Asakusa to Akihabara at one point. While wandering around if you get hungry there are always shops nearby and lots of vending machines to get a quick drink from.figure id=\"attachment_1986\" style=\"width: 960px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1986\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/11044496101542222941289127734989852633614610n1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/11044496101542222941289127734989852633614610n1.jpg 960w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/11044496101542222941289127734989852633614610n1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/11044496101542222941289127734989852633614610n1-768x432.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"There are vending machines on practically every corner, some of them even sponsored by American celebrities!/figcaption/figure figure id=\"attachment1982\" style=\"width: 2048px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"img class=\"size-full wp-image-1982\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18278126101555863278539122025259044343822927o1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18278126101555863278539122025259044343822927o1.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18278126101555863278539122025259044343822927o1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18278126101555863278539122025259044343822927o1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18278126101555863278539122025259044343822927o1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18278126101555863278539122025259044343822927_o1-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"I'm not much of a foodie so I won't comment on the food, though I will admit to eating a lot more Japanese curry when I'm here./figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nWhat to do in Tokyo though? If you're a gamer or an otaku, there's obviously Akihabara -- on each trip I went there more than once just to browse the numerous shops selling comics, toys, figurines, games, and so on. I would spend even more time there if I could read Japanese of course! (Working on it!)\r\n\r\nAside from that, there's a few tourist spots you can visit in the city proper. Some of the places I've been to include:\r\n\r\n  Senso-ji temple in Asakusa. This is a good place to visit mainly because Asakusa is a good area to stay in, as many of the places to visit are easily accessible from Asakusa station\r\n  Tokyo Skytree in Asakusa. I only climbed the Skytree during the second trip, it offers a great view of the city.\r\n  Tokyo Tower. It's smaller than the Skytree, but I'm sure fans of Rayearth will want to visit it haha. I visited it on this last trip to see One Piece and Final Fantasy exhibits.\r\n  Shibuya crossing. It's a famous crosswalk for some reason, and there's also a statue here of that dog Hachiko. There's also a lot of shopping places nearby if you like that kind of thing.figure id=\"attachment_1984\" style=\"width: 2048px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"size-full wp-image-1984\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18238211101555862850089128962147114996121859o1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18238211101555862850089128962147114996121859o1.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18238211101555862850089128962147114996121859o1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18238211101555862850089128962147114996121859o1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18238211101555862850089128962147114996121859o1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18238211101555862850089128962147114996121859o1-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"There's a lot of temples in Tokyo (and the rest of Japan) where you can send prayers like this one here/figcaption/figure figure id=\"attachment1985\" style=\"width: 540px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"img class=\"size-full wp-image-1985\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18221955101555862758739127657365650867510473n1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"540\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18221955101555862758739127657365650867510473n1.jpg 540w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18221955101555862758739127657365650867510473n1-169x300.jpg 169w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"This is a picture of the Tokyo Skytree/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nEven if you don't have much you want to visit in Tokyo proper, it's a great base of operations that you can use to visit nearby areas. That's what we did during this trip. You can leave most of your luggage in storage -- there are coin lockers in the major stations -- and just take an overnight bag to visit nearby tourist spots like Fuji or Edo wonderland in Nikko.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure when I'll visit Japan again (I don't think going there for the Olympics is a good idea), but I wouldn't mind staying in Tokyo again, that's for sure.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18193267101555863307289125172839765872331951_o1.jpg\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/12299236101542222951839122882233159207648588_n1.jpg\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/11044496101542222941289127734989852633614610_n1.jpg\r\n [4]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18278126101555863278539122025259044343822927_o1.jpg\r\n [5]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D\r\n [6]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18238211101555862850089128962147114996121859_o1.jpg\r",

This effort is mostly for the experienced developers -- for new hires they will need to learn something regardless\r\n  Having an in-house team developing your own framework means you have a core set of developers experienced in the full stack. Reliance on open source frameworks means most of your developers won't be familiar with the low level details.\r\n\r\nIn the end, there's no guarantee that using an open source framework will be painless or be better than developing one in-house. So I can understand the decision to stick with what you know. But for me as a developer, I feel that it's more rewarding to be exposed to different frameworks.\r\n\r\nIn fact I wrote this post because recently someone asked me what my \"go-to web framework\" was and I said I didn't have one. I'd rather be flexible enough to learn and work with any existing framework. In our industry where change happens quickly and can catch you by surprise, I think that flexibility is a much more valuable asset to have.",

There was also a sale on Steam controllers, but I had a variety of controllers at home to try out, so I passed on that.\r\n\r\nThe Steam Link came in a box that was bigger than I was expected. The box looks neat though:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2458\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170703170009.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170703170009.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170703170009-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170703170009-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170703170009-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170703170009-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /And this is the only device I've ever bought that came with a bunch of adapters for different socket types:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2456\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628160947.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628160947.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628160947-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628160947-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628160947-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628160947-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /\r\n\r\nThe device itself is about as large as external hard drive:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2457\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628161009.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1152\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628161009.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628161009-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628161009-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628161009-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628161009-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /\r\n\r\nUsage is fairly simple. You hook it up to the TV with an HDMI cable. You connect controllers or dongles via USB. Some controllers like the Steam Controller have wireless support. Network connectivity is through a LAN cable or via wi-fi. When it starts up, it searches your home network for computers running Steam, then it gives you a code that you type into the computer to grant access. Once that's done, you can stream your games to the TV.\r\n\r\nI first tried it out with a Logitech F710 Wireless Gamepad that I've had forever, since that's explicitly meant for games on Windows. I plugged the dongle into the USB slot, but had some trouble at first with the controller not being detected or taking multiple button presses to respond. I wondered if it was lag due to a poor network and worried that I had just wasted some money. It turns out however, that the batteries on the controller simply needed replacing haha.\r\n\r\nWhen streaming to the Link, Steam uses Big Picture mode:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2455\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0211.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0211.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0211-300x225.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0211-768x576.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0211-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0211-1200x900.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /\r\n\r\nI tried a couple of games I got during the recent Steam sale. I've already sunk in at least 8 hours on Ori and the Blind Forest (that includes a lot of dying repeatedly!). This game is a Microsoft exclusive, so I'd never have been able to play it from a couch without the link. A very pretty game too.\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2454\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0210.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0210.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0210-300x225.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0210-768x576.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0210-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0210-1200x900.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /\r\n\r\nI also wanted to test if an arcade stick would work. I had a PS3 Hori arcade stick at home, so I used it to play a bit of Guilty Gear Xrd:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2453\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0209.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2048\" height=\"1536\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0209.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0209-300x225.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0209-768x576.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0209-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG0209-1200x900.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2048px) 100vw, 2048px\" /\r\n\r\nI was also able to test that the PS4 controller works when wired. Supposedly the PS4 controller and the WiiU Pro controller can both work wirelessly, but I had both the PS4 and the WiiU in the same room so I couldn't try it without activating the consoles.\r\n\r\nI'm using a LAN cable, and there's no noticeable lag or anything. Only annoyance so far is that the controller seems to become unresponsive if I bring up the Steam overlay midgame and try to go back to the game. (If the Link becomes unresponsive, you can still go to your computer and turn it off from there.) All the processing power still comes from your computer, so enjoying your Steam games on the TV still depends on having a decent computer.\r\n\r\nWhile a lot of my Steam games are also available on consoles I have, it's often cheaper to get them on Steam, so I've been looking towards restricting my console purchases to mostly exclusives only. Having the Steam Link helps with that, since I can still enjoy my Steam games on the TV and comfortably from a couch. All in all, a great experience, and a pretty good buy I think.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: http://store.steampowered.com/app/353380/Steam_Link/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170703170009.jpg\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628160947.jpg\r\n [4]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG20170628161009.jpg\r\n [5]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_0211.jpg\r\n [6]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/IMG_0210.jpg\r",

There's a highly-competitive entrance exam and we've always been told that students who make it in are considered the \"cream of the crop.\" (I don't know that I've ever heard anyone outside Pisay say that though.) Students are given full scholarships and a modest stipend, and are required to take a science course upon graduation.\r\n\r\nThe movie was pretty good. It was more or less four short stories tied together, each one focused on a different year and following a particular batch of students through their stay at Pisay. Each story covers themes central to the Pisay experience: the difficulty of getting in, balancing academics and relationships, stipends, homesickness, trying to pass and failing, wanting to take a non-science course, and so on. The movie takes place during the school years from 1982-1986, basically during the fall of the dictatorship. So it also gets to cover some of the major events during that period and the senior year story has a stronger focus on activism.\r\n\r\nI suspect that the movie will be a lot more appreciated by people who actually went to Pisay or people who lived through the 80s. (I'm not sure if teenagers in the 80s really used that much slang though.) I'm also not sure how accurate it is as a reflection of what it was to be a Pisay student in the 80s -- some things felt deliberately dramatized for the film's sake. (That's fine though.)\r\n\r\nThis movie hits all the nostalgia points even though it takes place in a completely different time period than when I was there. I look back fondly on my days in Pisay and consider that an important formative period for me. It was challenging and rewarding and it was great to be among peers that shared many of my interests and many lifelong friendships were formed. Maybe someday I'll write about the experience more, but probably one blog post wouldn't be enough.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r",

I turned off the lights and climbed into bed, hoping to get to sleep early for a change. I hadn't been in bed five minutes when I thought about something I hadn't tried yet. I picked up the tablet that was beside my bed and did a few google searches and soon I was back on my desktop trying out some parameters I hadn't tried yet./p \r\n    \r\n    p\r\n      Ideally one practices some sort of compartmentalization. There should be a clear boundary between work and non-work and you can set work aside as needed. It's something I'm really bad at, as seen in the example above.\r\n    /p\r\n    \r\n    p\r\n      It's something that needs a certain kind of discipline, and we all know discipline isn't my strong point. Working from home and with everything in the cloud and accessible online makes that discipline even more important. And even more difficult! It's a lot easier to create separation when your work stuff is only accessible from the office.\r\n    /p\r\n    \r\n    p\r\n      My tendency for multitasking probably doesn't help either. Even when I'm playing a video game or out on a walk, I can still get distracted by notifications on my phone. I'm used to it and I expect it and I don't really want to disconnect -- so maybe I'm kind of asking for it too.\r\n    /p\r\n    \r\n    p\r\n      The other day I was supposed to take a day off from work and was planning to chill all day and maybe work on some personal projects. Still I ended up replying to a few emails and discussing some stuff on slack even while I was playing Persona 5. It wasn't much work time but still drove home that I was so bad at compartmentalization.\r\n    /p\r\n    \r\n    p\r\n      Software development is also like any other professions that involves creative problem solving. It's hard to set aside the problems you're trying to solve. You can't just suddenly quit on a problem at a certain time. They tend to keep spinning around in your head and will pop back into mind at random. And once a new idea or solution does come to you, one might think it wise to just write it down and pursue it later, but then you risk losing flow. Flow is a valuable commodity in professions like mine, so you kind of want to ride along with it when it decides to come.\r\n    /p\r\n    \r\n    p\r\n      Supposedly you should be setting aside specific times of the day for when you hunker down to work. That way your mind gets conditioned that \"this is work time\". And it makes it easier for you to create that separation between work time and nonwork time. And hopefully flow comes to you at the proper time instead of randomly while pooping. That's not always easy though, and not always viable due to scheduling concerns. But it should be a step in the right direction. Hopefully it's not too late to learn that kind of discipline./span/div /div",

Unfortunately, I ended up not having time to prepare for the tournament itself. Fortunately, it was a limited event rather than constructed, so I figured maybe I could wing it and still do well. (Spoiler: I could not.)\r\n\r\nPrior to the trip, my prep for the sealed format had consisted of a single pool at my prerelease and reading a few articles online the night before the trip. I went there on Day 0/Friday to try a last chance trial, but didn't get past the first round due to a \"I'm still testing\" mentality that meant poor mulligans and not reading the cards and tilting and scooping before figuring out there was an alternative.\r\n\r\nLater that night, we opened 6 different sealed pools and tried out a few different builds to get a feel for the format. I liked the B/W vampires archetype best, and felt that the format was aggressive and wanted to avoid dinosaur decks which would have too many high-end drops. (Spoilers: Dinosaur decks would be my undoing). I knew I wanted to open cards like Bishop's Soldier, Mark of the Vampire, Walk the Plank, Vanquish the Weak, Ixalan's Binding and so on.\r\n\r\nWe ended our night prep with a few simple guidelines for the next day:\r\n\r\n  Read the cards\r\n  Mulligan well\r\n  Think before scooping\r\n  Life is unfair\r\n\r\nMain event time: Amazingly, the judges had pre-registered all the sealed pools. I was happy to note as I opened my pool that I had opened many of the cards I wanted to see. I had a secondary R/G dino list that seemed workable but lacking a few playables. I just went with B/W aggro since that's what I was confident with. Here's the build I went with:\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist title=\"GP Singapore 2017 Sealed Deck\" }}\r\n  \r\n[Creatures]\r\n  \r\n1 Blight Keeper\r\n  \r\n1 Bishop's Soldier\r\n  \r\n1 Fathom Fleet Captain\r\n  \r\n1 Queen's Bay Soldier\r\n  \r\n1 Seekers' Squire\r\n  \r\n1 Deadeye Tormentor\r\n  \r\n1 Inspiring Cleric\r\n  \r\n1 Mavren Fein, Dusk Apostle\r\n  \r\n1 Ruthless Knave\r\n  \r\n1 Skymarch Bloodletter\r\n  \r\n1 Territorial Hammerskull\r\n  \r\n2 Paladin of the Bloodstained\r\n  \r\n1 Anointed Deacon\r\n  \r\n2 Shining Aerosaur\r\n  \r\n[/Creatures]\r\n  \r\n[Spells]\r\n  \r\n1 Slash of Talons\r\n  \r\n1 Skullduggery\r\n  \r\n1 Walk the Plank\r\n  \r\n1 Vanquish the Weak\r\n  \r\n1 Pirate Cutlass\r\n  \r\n1 Mark of the Vampire\r\n  \r\n1 Ixalan's Binding\r\n  \r\n1 Contract Killing\r\n  \r\n[/Spells]\r\n  \r\n[Lands]\r\n  \r\n9 Swamp\r\n  \r\n7 Plains\r\n  \r\n[/Lands]\r\n  \r\n[Relevant Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n1 Demystify\r\n  \r\n1 Encampment Keeper\r\n  \r\n1 Sheltering Light\r\n  \r\n2 Queen's Commission\r\n  \r\n1 Fathom Fleet Cutthroat\r\n  \r\n1 Pterodon Knight\r\n  \r\n1 Bright Reprisal\r\n  \r\n[/Relevant Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\nHere's a blurry image if you like that sort of thing:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2504\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG20171216211718.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4096\" height=\"2304\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG20171216211718.jpg 2048w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG20171216211718-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG20171216211718-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG20171216211718-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG20171216211718-1200x675.jpg 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 4096px) 100vw, 4096px\" /\r\n\r\nI was pretty happy with the pool and thought I could do well. The deck looked good, if a bit lacking in two drops. To the swiss!\r\n\r\nFirst 3 rounds: WIN. Aggro deck works as expected. Feels good to get a good GP start.\r\n\r\nRound 4: LOSS vs B/W. The guy I fought here eventually finished Day 1 undefeated, so I guess he had a pretty good pool anyway. I was saddened by the early loss, but there was still much to give.\r\n\r\nRound 5: Win. Hooray, we are back on track. Or so I thought.\r\n\r\nRound 6: Loss vs B/G dinosaurs and removal. Ok, guy had a really solid pool and I tilted a bit, that's fine. 7-2 for Day one was still doable and a perfectly decent finish.\r\n\r\nRound 7: Loss vs R/G dinos. Ugh. Now I see the problem with not having enough two drops. Not able to push through enough early damage means the opponent stabilizes. Mana problems at 16 lands doesn't help either. No more losses to give after this one.\r\n\r\nRound 8: Loss vs R/G dinos again. Similar story as the last round. I message my friend who had gone home earlier. \"Good news! I don't have to come in early tomorrow!\" Sigh.\r\n\r\nRound 9: Playing just for fun now. Aaand I lose a very close game 3 to another B/W deck.\r\n\r\nOh well, that's Ixalan limited for me then. The next set drops early January so I'm not playing this format again. The good news is, even if you scrub out on day one, there's always Chaos Sealed to look forward to on Day Two!\r\n\r\nChaos Sealed\r\n\r\nChaos Sealed was pricey since we get two Masters boosters this time.

I did use a few Unstable cards, just removal and some solid creatures. None of that contraption silliness, though I did have the opportunity to lose to one later on. I also had a foil Terminate that happened to be by the GP artist so I managed to get it signed.\r\n\r\nI won the first 3 rounds on the back of my fliers, then lost round 4 to a mildly annoying Chinese person, then did an ID with the 5th round opponent. Got enough points for like 5/6ths of an Ixalan box. I actually wanted to get a GP shirt, but they were out of XXXLs. At least I managed to win something for the weekend so it wasn't a total wash.\r\n\r\nI'm a bit sad about not performing well in both GPs I attended this year, and as always it makes me think about quitting competitive Magic completely. It requires a lot of time and effort to keep up and be familiar with the metagame. In fact, I had already decided to skip the Standard GP in Singapore next June. (This will be the first GP Singapore that I would have missed since 2010). I'll probably stick to Modern mostly for the near future.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2017/12/singapore-2017/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/2011/06/grand-prix-singapore-tournament-report/\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/IMG20171216211718.jpg\r",

        "content": "---\r\nauthor: roy\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2017-12-28 01:00:38\r\ntags:\r\nSoftware Development\r\ntitle: My Coding Approach\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2017/12/my-coding-approach/\r\n---\r\n\r\nI was thinking about my typical approach to coding. When writing a new feature, I tend to implement in the direction of where the data flows, starting from the user interface then to the backend and back to the frontend and wherever else that goes. I will build incrementally, using debugging tools or console printouts to ensure that each step is working correctly.\r\n\r\nAs an example, here's how I did a recent web-based function:\r\n\r\n  The user needs to see a new button on the screen, so I add the HTML for that button and just have the click handler be an alert confirming the button has been clicked.\r\n  The button needs to open a modal dialog. I write the HTML for the modal dialog, then add the code to the button to launch the modal.\r\n  On load, the modal dialog needs to fetch some data from the server. I write the Javascript to make the ajax call on launch of the modal.\r\n  On the backend, I map the URL route used by the above ajax call to a controller method. The controller method simply outputs a debug message to the console. I refresh the page on the front end, click the button to launch the modal and verify on my server's console that the controller method has been called.\r\n  I modify the controller method to call a method on the relevant model. I write the stub method on the model with a dummy return value, which the controller method then outputs to the console. I verify the entire flow again.\r\n  I write the retrieval logic in the controller method. I verify the entire flow again, using server console output to verify the correct data is being returned to the controller.\r\n  I have the controller write the returned data to the response as JSON. I go back to the frontend and modify the success handler of the ajax call to log the response to the Javascript console. At this point, I also update the error handler to do whatever is appropriate. I verify the entire flow again, this time confirming that the correct data is displayed in the browser console.\r\n  The user needs to see the data from the response, so I write the Javascript and HTML to render the response inside the modal dialog. I verify the entire flow again, this time confirming that the correct data is shown in the modal dialog.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if this is the best approach, but it works for me. It feels incremental, systematic, methodical, and easy to see where things go wrong (which they inevitably do). As kind of an upside, I also strangely feel compelled to not stop until I have working complete flow. Of course the downside is that if I have to stop at any point, I now have a nonworking UI component, but at least that's a clear indicator of where I need to pick up next time.\r\n\r\nI realize that a lot of modern software engineering advocates recommend some kind of test-driven approach. I imagine with such an approach start with the smallest iota of functionality, write a test for it, then write the actual code, then work outwards from there, building more complexity on top. So for the example above, maybe I should have started with the retrieval logic on the backend then work my way outwards from there.\r\n\r\nI do that sometimes but I find that as a full-stack engineer my natural tendency is work my way across a new feature in this manner -- from user interface to backend and back. Combined with the difficulty of writing code to test UI/HTML/JavaScript, this means I rarely get into the mindset of test-driven development. It's not something I ever got used to. Maybe someday a switch will click and I will get it and my mind will be blown.\r\n\r\nMy approach does have some benefits though, in that I'm defining the interfaces first before diving into the guts of the logic. In that sense it's kind of \"test-driven\" except all my testing is manual.\r\n\r\nI do think having such a systematic, incremental method of implementation is a good skill for the junior programmer to learn though. My experience is that many younger programmers (especially those fresh out of college) tend to write huge chunks of code/logic/functionality then get surprised when the very first thing breaks down.\r\n\r\nRecently when sitting down with a junior to help them walk through some problem I often show them how I debug problems this way. I trace the entire flow from start to end, adding debug messages as I go, to help identify at which step the process goes awry. I also try to describe my proposed approach for complex new functions this way. I'll prototype a small part of it from frontend to backend, writing debug messages all the way, and it conveniently leaves the junior with a template for writing the rest of the functionality. (Although I am as of yet unable to attest to the efficacy of this approach)\r\n\r\nI've been writing code for a long time, and while I wasn't self-aware enough back when I started out to document how I was writing software, I like to think I've improved a lot since then. And for sure there's still a lot to learn. Maybe some years from now I'll look back on this blog post and chuckle about how naive I was and write a new blog post detailing an even better approach.",

        "content": "---\r\nauthor: roy\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2017-12-22 01:00:35\r\ntags:\r\nTravels\r\ntitle: Singapore 2017\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2017/12/singapore-2017/\r\n---\r\n\r\nI took a 5-day trip to Singapore last weekend, mostly to play in the Grand Prix, but the opportunity to get away from the country for a while was appreciated. These are some notes and anecdotes from the trip. (Not about the GP itself, that's a separate post on its own.)\r\n  By my count this would be my 5th visit to Singapore. That means Singapore now ties Hong Kong for my most visited foreign destination. My last HK visit was back in 2009, there was no overlap.\r\n  Normally when flying out I prefer to check luggage so that I'm not carrying much on the plane. This time I decided to go the opposite route. I hadn't prepaid for any checked baggage so I tightly packed 5 days worth of clothes into a single backpack for hand carry. It was 0.2kg over the limit, but the lady at the check-in counter didn't bother to check.\r\n  My flight was 5am from Manila to Singapore, mostly so I wouldn't run afoul of the horrible December traffic on the way to the airport. This plan would have worked better had I not also decided to watch The Last Jedi on it's first night, mere hours before the flight. That meant I was quite sleepy while waiting at the airport. I'm not one of those people who can sleep alone at the airport -- I'm worried about people touching my stuff.\r\n  The plane I was getting on was one of those smaller ones with six seats to a row and a single aisle in between. I'd ridden in one of these before, but this was the first time I managed to take a look at how tiny the plane was from the window at the boarding gate. It was barely bigger than an EDSA city bus. I've flown many times and I understand the physics, but I'm still amazed that basically a big chunk of metal carries us across the skies by momentum.\r\n  Tall people problem no. 37: practically impossible to get a decent sleep on these budget airlines with their little to no legroom and seat backs too short. I managed to get a few  pockets of sleep but nothing continuous as I had to keep adjusting my neck every so often. The flight was three and a half hours, fitbit says I managed to get around 1 hour of sleep.\r\n  I met up with a friend at Changi's new terminal 4. This terminal was new enough that my flight itinerary still said terminal 2. I would be crashing at my friend's place for the trip. I think I'd stayed at their place twice before.\r\n  We took a long train ride to Tiong Bahru where we had a Mos Burger for brunch before taking a bus back to their place. When I originally booked the trip, I assumed I would have free time Thursday to wander about a bit, since the MTG event starts Friday. However, due to lack of sleep I ended up just taking an afternoon nap and mostly lazing around for the rest of the day.\r\n  Internet in Singapore is of course much better and faster than in Manila. But it's a bit less tourist-friendly than say, Tokyo, where every Metro station and 7-11 had free wifi the wandering traveller could use. My friend lent me a mifi to use for the stay, but luckily there was free wifi at both our transition point at Tiong Bahru plaza and at the Singapore Expo where the event was being held.\r\n 10. I had turned off my mobile data prior to boarding the plane to avoid exorbitant roaming charges. Despite that, I managed to accidentally pocket dial someone back home. I'll find out how much that costs in my next bill.\r\n 11. Aside from the internet, the other thing I like about visiting foreign cities is the public transit. Buses and trains were pretty much the same as I had noted in previous visits, except that they had managed to add a new train line since I was last here, giving us a secondary route to the expo. Basically while Manila's MRT had been continuously breaking down over the past three years, Singapore managed to add a new line and there's even another one in construction already. Stark contrast.\r\n 12. Singapore doesn't have as many train lines yet as HK or London though, and the place I was staying with was out of reach of the train lines, so I still had to transition to buses often. My friend lent me an EZLink card I could use to pay for buses and trains. A robust public transit infrastructure including buses and trains, with predictable schedules and routes you could track online, and a universal payment scheme -- some of my modest hopes for Metro Manila.\r\n 13. I'm not much of a foodie, so I don't really go to other countries to experience their food, so nothing too special to note in that regard. However, I found out that in Singapore, Burger King doesn't have the 4-cheese whopper (!). Later during the MTG event I spoke with an American dude who works for BK in Singapore and he mentioned that even though the 4CW is a best seller in the Philippines, it didn't do too well in Singapore. Their best seller is the mushroom swiss whopper thing. (Yuck mushrooms!)\r\n 14. This my first time in Singapore in December, and I think also the first time I've experienced rain here. It was a bit heavy while I was at the expo on Friday, I had to wander around Tiong Bahru Plaza a bit on the way back, to give the rain time to settle. Of course I had no umbrella, as I believed I was not allowed to bring one on a plane.\r\n 15. There were book and IT sales at the expo during the weekend I was there. I thought about buying some Marvel trades. They were selling for 10 for S$50, but I would never have been able to fit those in my backpack for the trip home. The electronics and laptops still seemed expensive, even for a sale.\r\n 16. Well, Singapore is an expensive city in general. Meals typically cost 2-3 times what they would back home in Manila. When I'm in a foreign country, I try to avoid doing the conversion math all the time for meals -- I went here knowing how much it costs to live here after all. I do the conversion when browsing around for stuff to buy for back home. The conversion rate of around 37php to 1SGD wasn't convenient, but luckily my friend was a math major and told me to just divide by 8 and multiply by 300. Intuitively it didn't seem like it would be easier, but it actually was.\r\n 17. Another thing that strikes me whenever I'm wandering about in Singapore is the diversity. On the train, there's always a smattering of Chinese, Indians, Filipinos, White people, etc. With the recent rise in worldwide news of people expressing hatred towards people who are not of the same descent, it's refreshing to be in such an environment.\r\n 18. My flight home was just before 7pm on the Monday after the Grand Prix. That meant I had the day to kill, as it were. Packing when quickly (since I didn't bring much). Spent some time wandering around a mall in the Orchard Road area. Malls in Singapore are a lot more...  high end than malls in the Philippines. More like Podium and less like SM Megamall. Browsed through comics in Kinokinuya for a bit (and decided they were too expensive), then headed back to Tiong Bahru for a late lunch and then back to Changi.\r\n 19. Sadly, I had forgotten to web check-in for my flight. Because of travel anxiety, I'm often well-prepared for flying out, but have no similar best practices for flying back. They didn't have any of those automated check-in kiosks available either, so I had to queue with a whole bunch of OFWs. The annoying thing about OFWs flying back is that they're often a bit older people who have a ton of luggage and hence take forever at the check-in counter. Some will even argue or haggle over how much they're allowed to bring. One lady in front of me said she wasn't even aware there was a limit to check-in baggage. @_@\r\n 20. When it was my time to check-in, I was done in around a minute. The lady behind the counter asked to weigh my hand carry bag, luckily I had somehow shaved off some weight and it was at a comfortable 0.5kg under the limit.\r\n 21. For outgoing immigration at Singapore, if you had your biometrics taken on your way in, you can just do automated immigration. You just scan your passport and boarding pass and your fingerprint and you're good to go. Neat. The last time I was here, outgoing immigration gave me a scolding for losing the small piece of cardboard that was once part of the card I filled up on the way in. I didn't need it this time.\r\n 22. Terminal 4 seems much smaller than terminal 2. It's still large and spacious and kind of like a mall though. I didn't have much time to browse around, other than buying some bakkwa for people back home. There was an arcade area where I could play Marvel vs Capcom 2, but I was too lazy for that. And of course, there's ample places to charge, which was nice.\r\n 23. The plane for the flight home was bigger than the one coming on, one of those with 3 sets of 3 seats per row, with two aisles. Amazingly, I had the same seatmates as I did on the flight coming in. They were a young couple that I guess were on their honeymoon or something (they had wedding rings on). We didn't really talk or anything, just the \"Oo nga!\" when I noted the coincidence.\r\n 24. I wasn't really sleepy during this flight, so I spent some time drafting this blog post instead. I also managed to win some kind of Cebu Pacific pouch thing off one of those trivia games that they sometimes have. I managed to answer the incredibly challenging question \"Where did the child see mommy kissing Santa Claus?\"\r\n 25. Flight landed around 10:45 without incident. This schedule I booked had the same rationale as for my outgoing flight: I wanted to avoid Metro Manila traffic. However even this late wasn't enough, and I failed many times to get an Uber or a Grab. Reluctantly I queued for a regular taxi. Fighting through Metro Manila traffic, I finally managed to get home a bit past 1am, despite my cab driver being obviously sleepy. Our cab also got sideswiped along the way, with some severe damage on the front headlights and bumper.\r\n 26. The trip is in the books. Aside from doing poorly at the GP itself, it was pretty good. Good to get away for a bit and see old friends and hang out. It felt a bit weirdly casual too, like I randomly popped in to Singapore for no reason. The weekend went quickly, and so back to the grind.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://magic.wizards.com/en/events/premierplay/grandprix/fact-sheet-gpsin17\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/2011/06/singapore/\r",

Last year I posted some year-end statistics. That seems like a good way to recap the year, so let's do it again. Random statistics from 2017:\r\n\r\n  45 blog posts (including this one; total of 818 currently on this site according to wp-admin, though that number doesn't add up to last year's stats; down 34 posts from last year, an indicator of increased busyness)\r\n  0 words written for Nanowrimo (hopefully I can have another go next year)\r\n  59 sketches submitted to r/sketchdaily (a far cry from last year's 321, yet another indicator of busyness)\r\n  Duolingo streak: 0 days. But I did manage to start the Japanese track and do it in parallel with the Spanish track. Will pick this up again in January.\r\n  Answers written on Quora: 17. Down by 410 lol. I started writing answers on Quora last year a bit out of boredom but my interest kinda tapered out. I still answer on occasion.\r\n  Programming languages/frameworks learned: I'll say 5. I did projects with Node.JS and React Native. I was also involved in a non-trivial PHP project for a while, so I'll count that as well (my previous exposure to PHP was only small scale.) Not really a PL or FW, but I also learned usage of MarkLogic NoSQL database which also gave me an opportunity to learn XQuery. Maybe I'll write a more detailed post about these later on\r\n  Other countries visited: 2 (Japan and Singapore). Probably 0 next year.\r\n  MTG GPs attended: 2 (Manila and Singapore). Did not do too well this year. Probably 0 next year.\r\n  Instagram posts: 121 (Down 269. Mostly due to lack of sketchdaily)\r\n  Facebook activity: 192 statuses, 269 links, 245 photos, 53 videos. You can generate your own report at Wolfram Alpha\r\n  New facebook friends: 9 (down 30)\r\n  Baptisms attended: 1 (down 3)\r\n  Weddings attended: 1 (down 1)\r\n  Wakes attended: 2 (up 1; T_T)\r\n  Games purchased (not including any I got for free for some reason): 67 (!) (up 48! Most of that is due to a humble bundle I got that had 30 games; (3 PS4 retail, 1 Wii U retail, 21 Steam, 1 from a GOG Pinata, 41 from Humble Bundle; maybe I should scale back a bit lol)\r\n  Games \"finished\" (story/campaign completed OR achievement complete): 8 (FFXV, KH2, P5, BotW, One Piece:PW3, Stardew Valley, Persona Q, Ori and the Blind Forest). I'm also like 95% through FF12 Zodiac Age, but I'm trying to do as much stuff I can before finishing it.\r\n  Best Eternal Rank: Master (363)\r\n  Average points per turn in Words with Friends: 27 (up from 26.5)\r\n  Books read: 9 D: (Down 21 from last year; year target was 52). Here's the list. Need to read moar\r\n  Things watched on Netflix: 720 (Down 160 from last year! Another indicator of busyness?)\r\n  Quiz nights attended: 19 (we won 3 times)\r\n  Uber trips: 64 (up 42 from last year!)\r\n  Minutes spent outside walking or running: 21,573 (down around 200 minutes from last year; slightly above 59 minutes per day). This is based on Google Fit statistics. Hopefully next year I can use the Fitbit instead.\r\n  Donuts eaten: 12 (a 200% increase over last year!)\r\n  Times I won the lotto: 0 (I kind of regret putting this number last year, as now I can't remove it without looking suspicious)\r\n  Bears defeated in single combat: 0\r\n\r\n(Since I started working again last year I thought about logging my hours/income here as well, but that seemed like a bad idea.)\r\n\r\nLooking forward to better numbers in 2018!\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/2017/01/my-2016-in-numbers/\r\n [2]: http://roytang.net/2016/12/nanowrimo-2016-post-mortem/\r\n [3]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SketchDaily/\r\n [4]: http://roytang.net/2017/04/marklogic-nosql/\r\n [5]: http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=facebook+report#_=_\r",

(I seldom even do the 1920&#215;1440 joke these days.) I mean, I'm all about productivity and improvement and changing for the better, but I've found that very specific resolutions don't often work for me. Mostly because I have very little focus (obviously something that an be improved).\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 682613316246585344 }}\r\n\r\nSo my tendency now is to stick to general, high level resolutions (like the above) that don't go into anything too specific. And so this year I decided on something like that. My NYR for this year is: Do at least one personally productive thing per day.\r\n\r\nBy personally, I mean something outside of work, something I do for myself. By productive, I mean something that helps me improve or grow or live a better life in some manner. And this excludes any manner of consumption (reading, eating, watching TV, browsing reddit, playing games, etc)\r\n\r\nSo yes, it's still kind of vague, but my intent is to minimize or even completely avoid those days where I just totally laze out the entire day and not do anything outside of what I needed to do for work. Not that there's anything wrong with that -- chilling out is important too -- but I felt like maybe I had a bit too many of those days last year.\r\n\r\nSome examples of things which I think will qualify for this resolution:\r\n\r\n  Writing a blog post. (Hooray, I already got one done today!)\r\n  Doing some work on one of my many secret projects that I never get going or never get finished. There's a lot of these to choose from. It helps a bit with my lack of focus -- I can do other projects if I'm not in the mood for the previous one I was working on. If you're curious, this typically means some kind of writing or programming project.\r\n  Some art thing. I did get back into drawing and sketching in 2016 and kinda tapered off in 2017, hopefully I can get back on track.\r\n  Learning something new. Arguably reading or being on the internet always lets me learn something new, but let's say this means dedicating some focused time to a learning activity.\r\n  Throwing out or deleting stuff I don't need anymore. Not all growth comes from expansion; we also need to throw out old stuff we don't need anymore to make room for the new.\r\n  Reorganizing/Cleaning up/Optimizing. This is pretty broad, but basically anything that streamlines some aspect of my life or makes it easier.\r\n\r\nDuring the previous year, I had actually wanted to pursue many of these things all at once -- I wanted to be able to do daily sketching AND writing AND cleaning up AND side projects, etc. Didn't really work out, so this year we lower our standards a bit. Just one of those things per day.\r\n\r\nOne of the challenges would be finding the time to be personally productive even during those days when I'm mentally tired out from work stuff -- you know, the kind of day where you get home and you just kinda wanna sit in a chair and not think about stuff too hard. Hopefully I don't get too many of those days, but hopefully the resolution inspires me to do even one small thing during the difficult days.",

Apparently I didn't bother writing on the blog about it back then, so I thought I'd do it now.\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"GiJBHdX\"\r\n  a href=\"https://imgur.com/GiJBHdX\"View post on imgur.com/a\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nThe exchange went a tiny bit viral on social media, with friends telling me about people I don't know sharing the image of the conversation on Facebook and Twitter. (I'm not sure if it was the exact same image above.). Even today, if you Google &#8216;Globe \"rotten bananas\"&#8216; you still get a few relevant hits.\r\n\r\nI believe the CS account eventually deleted the offending tweets, I can only see my own tweets on the matter:\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 431649435047583745 }}\r\n\r\nToday, Globe Telecom no longer offers any plans with \"unlimited data\", as far as I know. I feel like I can claim some nontrivial responsibility in that decision, but it doesn't seem like something to be proud of.\r\n\r\nI myself had resisted shifting to a new plan for a while (so I can carry over my unlimited data), but eventually had to shift to a 3gb capped plan because I wanted to get my mom a new phone on the cheap. They do offer unlimited data for their new fiber home broadband plans, for around 30% higher monthly fees than the capped plans.\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"Cg5GI3G\"\r\n  a href=\"https://imgur.com/Cg5GI3G\"View post on imgur.com/a\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nIf you think about it, a 3gb bandwidth cap seems ridiculous in this day and age, but I've pretty much changed my behavior around it. I now very rarely watch Youtube or Facebook videos on the go for example. I prefer to watch stuff on the Desktop. (Phone screens are too tiny to appreciate most videos anyway.)\r\n\r\nGoing off on a slight tangent, our home broadband is now on a 50gb Globe fiber plan. Yes, I actually doubled-down on Globe despite all my problems with their customer service. In fact, even the migration of our Bayantel line over to Globe fiber was not without incident. Sadly, there is very little choice for high-speed coverage in our area. (I'm not inclined to try PLDT since I have a number of friends who also have poor customer service experience with them, and Converge isn't available in our area.). We've only had the fiber service for a little more than a month, but it's reasonably good so far. Some occasional slowdowns, but generally downloads are a lot faster. We have a bandwidth cap, but it's at 600gb and there's a mobile app that lets me monitor it. During the first month we only used less than 400gb, so I guess the cap is okay for now.\r\n\r\nI think overall we still have some of the worst internet service in the region. The poor quality of internet service in the Philippines has been one of my all-time pet peeves about living in this country. Hopefully the promised third telco player to be introduced brings us some improvements in terms of higher bandwidth caps and speeds and better prices.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-ab&ei=QSl7Wp-HGcK40ASUmYWQBg&q=globe+%22rotten+bananas%22&oq=globe+%22rotten+bananas%22&gsl=psy-ab.3...19552.21332.0.21630.2.2.0.0.0.0.107.213.0j2.2.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.1.107...0i22i30k1.0.tqjY78J2On0&gferd=cr&dcr=0\r\n [2]: http://www.fashionpulis.com/2014/02/talk2globe-refers-to-heavy-data-users.html\r",

For the past couple of weeks I've been following this beginner Blender tutorial where I had to make donuts. (Link to the tutorial series on Youtube.) Here's my output!figure id=\"attachment_2554\" style=\"width: 150px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"\r\n\r\nimg class=\"wp-image-2554 size-thumbnail\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/donut4-150x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"150\" height=\"150\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/donut4-150x150.png 150w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/donut4-100x100.png 100w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 150px) 100vw, 150px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"(click for full size)/figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nThis image took around 40 minutes to render. I had to do 2000 samples per tile which is why it was so slow. I was getting too much noise/graininess at lower sampling rates.\r\n\r\nI didn't follow the tutorial exactly. My plate is square and made of glass for one thing. The chocobutternut donut wasn't part of the tutorial, I just wanted to try it (obviously did not turn out too well and all those orange particles on the donut probably really slowed down the render lol). I also didn't bother too much with the stuff in the last two videos of the series which involved adjusting the lighting and other stuff to make the image prettier (wasn't really interested). I actually also tried to model a fork (not in the tutorial), but I couldn't get the tines right and gave up.\r\n\r\nA long time ago I read an interview in an old PC gaming mag about how they implemented Age of Empires and there was an image of a 3d mesh of a knight on horseback and I remember thinking \"That looks really complicated, I'll probably never be able to do something like that.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now that I've tried this tutorial, I have to agree with that initial assessment -- any complex modelling would surely try my patience. But I was also pleasantly surprised with how advanced Blender is -- I sort of imagined that you had to position and adjust all the mesh nodes/vertices/faces by hand a lot, but actually there's a ton of functions to make some common operations simpler (but it's still a lot of work).\r\n\r\nOne complaint is that Blender's user interface is very obtuse and daunting though -- I don't usually do video tutorials but I doubt I could have figured this stuff out on my own. Though I suppose it can't be helped given the sheer complexity of the task involved.\r\n\r\nI'm probably not going into any sort of significant 3d modelling or 3d artwork soon (like I said, not enough patience), but it was good to give it a try so at least I have a passing knowledge of some of the concepts involved.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: https://www.blender.org/\r\n [2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYj6e-72RDs&index=2&list=PLjEaoINr3zgHs8uzT3yqe4iHGfkCmMJ0P\r",

I'm not even sure my parents understand the kind of work I do, even though all four of their children are in the same industry.\r\n\r\nI think non-technical people generally just put you into a \"technical person\" bucket and assume you can do all sorts of technical wizardry. (I am not saying this is untrue!) The usual stereotype is relatives and friends asking you to fix their printer or their wifi, but I've gotten a few different kinds of requests over the years:\r\n\r\n  A high school friend who I haven't contacted in years messages me out of the blue because she wasn't receiving emails from her friends anymore. (It turns out she had somehow managed to block everything coming in from Gmail and Yahoo domains)\r\n  A different high school friend who I also haven't been in touch with also messages me to ask about an error on his laptop (I had no idea how to help him!)\r\n  Another high school friend asks me for advice on how to resolve a problem he has with permissions on his Windows 10 OS\r\n  A relative messages me with \"You're a graphic designer right?\" (I'm not, and IDK why I would give that impression). Follow-up: \"Which one of your siblings is the graphic designer?\" (None of us are!)\r\n  An acquaintance once asked me \"You can hack someone's Facebook right?\" (Not saying I can't, but I probably won't!)\r\n  Another acquaintance asked me if I could help him access a password protected Excel file. (Okay, I might be able to do this one, but it depends and it might take some time)\r\n  Recently there has also been an uptick in people asking me about Bitcoin (I know how it works, but please don't ask me in detail about the mining!)\r\n  Even technical people ask me stuff outside of my usual scope all the time. A client I help maintain the webapp for sometimes randomly asks me about networking issues on their internal network (I have no idea how that is set up! But I try to help anyway)\r\n\r\nI actually don't mind people randomly asking me technical questions. Or any kind of questions or advice really. I'll always try my best to answer and help if I can. I'm just slightly amused at what people imagine I'm able to do.\r\n\r\nSlightly related: I recently opened up my DMs on Twitter, so you can also ask me questions there!",

For a while, a #DeleteFacebook hashtag even made the rounds. I will admit that I had been considering reducing my own Facebook usage for a while, but not because of any data privacy issues.\r\n\r\nWhile I understand that Facebook probably mishandled private data and that this is a serious concern for a lot of people and even for society at large. It's just that it's not that much of an issue for me personally because of reasons:\r\n\r\n  I fully understand what data I'm giving up to Facebook. And I consent to their gathering that data. I even use that own data for my own purposes every so often. I like having access to a history of my online interaction with other people. It allows me an additional channel to look back into my own past and learn from it.\r\n  I'm careful about what permissions I give to apps. Supposedly the source of the Cambridge Analytica data was a personality quiz app. While I do take the occasional personality quiz, I wouldn't authorize one that was asking for any authorizations beyond the basic demographic information. I also don't seem to be affected by the logging of Android calls and texts, most probably because I didn't opt-in to something silly or manage to opt-out. I also regularly purge my Facebook app list of apps I no longer use. (I understand that the CA situation was because FB allowed users to authorize access to their friends' data, so I would have been vulnerable to this too even if I was careful.)\r\n  As a developer, I've studied the Facebook API myself, and I know it's limitations. In its current form, it's way more limited than it used to be. The Cambridge Analytica leak, where users who took the personality quiz leaked their friends' info without consent, is basically impossible now because the current version of the Graph API won't give access to a user's info unless that user has also authorized the same app. (This used to be not true, which is probably why the leak happened in the first place.)\r\n  I appreciate the idea of gathering large social data sets to study trends and patterns, so I do not necessarily consider the mass collection of user data an automatic bad. It can be useful if the data is handled and used properly. I will admit that I had considered gathering data via Facebook myself, for some research purposes, but the above-mentioned limitations of the GraphAPI made it very difficult. I also don't necessarily think it's bad that advertisers are given more power to target certain market segments according to the data gathered. This is an efficiency improvement, i.e. it can bring users more relevant ads. The problem is when the data is misused for nefarious purposes such as propaganda or misinformation.\r\n\r\nThere are however, other reasons that I have considered quitting Facebook (or at least reducing my usage) Foremost of which is it's a big time-waster. This is of course, true of the internet in general. But because I use Facebook to stay in touch mainly with family and friends whose interests don't always intersect with mine, the ratio of interesting to not-relevant-to-me content on my Facebook feeds is much worse than compared to say, Twitter or Reddit where I freely choose to follow only those sources that are relevant to my interests. Hence, my Facebook time has significantly more scrolling past irrelevant content comparatively. I try to mitigate this by ruthlessly unfollowing any Facebook friends whose content historically I have not found very interesting. (If you are one of those people and you actually find out and you read this far into this post, don't take it personally, we're still friends). Secondary reason would be I'm not a fan of the way the News Feed is handled right now. Stupid algorithmic sorting, and too many ads. (I've recently tried reporting every single ad in my feed as offensive, just to see what happens. I have yet to find any meaningful difference.) I'm also not a fan of Facebook's moderation policies, or their tendency to try to turn the internet into a monolithic walled garden (Facebook is the AOL of our times). And of course, there has been the recent trend of Facebook being used for propaganda and misinformation.\r\n\r\nEven with all the problems above, it would still be difficult for a lot of people to give up on Facebook. The main problem is the network effect. I mean, most of my family and friends are on there! My parents are on there, and all their friends. That means I occasionally have to help them with their Facebook accounts and post grandkid pictures for them, and they will ask me to use it to communicate with other relatives and organize family reunions so on. I also rely on Facebook for information on upcoming events such as Magic tournaments or quiz nights. This is another network effect thing; if the organizers of these events made their information publicly available anywhere other than Facebook, it would reduce Facebook's power. But it's a chicken-and-egg thing: most people are on Facebook, so it's easier to just post your events there.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, I have tried reducing my Facebook footprint overall. I no longer have the app installed on my devices (I still have Messenger. Messenger is useful). Firefox also recently released an extension to help reduce Facebook's online tracking of your behavior, which was nice of them. I've also set it up so that my microblogging will be primarily from Twitter. (Twitter of course has its own problems as a platform but at least they're not a monolithic juggernaut.)\r\n\r\nI think the main problem is Facebook being this giant monolithic platform that handles multiple things -- microblogging, networking, events, groups, photo sharing, etc. Having all of these functionalities all under the same platform makes it incredibly convenient for users, but it also gives the platform incredible power that can be easy to misuse.\r\n\r\nIf it were up to me, I would prefer having a set of open protocols that would allow multiple separate smaller services to exist and communicate with each other while being decentralized. Imagine if you had Service A for networking, Service B for microblogging, Service C for photo sharing, etc, all tied together by an open identity protocol. One would be able to \"add as friend\" or \"follow\" people from other networks. Each network would store its data separately, and would only make accessible whatever data the user has authorized for sharing. Imagine that Facebook users could choose to follow Twitter users on Facebook and see their Tweets appearing in your Facebook feed, but Facebook wouldn't have any data on the Twitter users' browsing habits etc, only the shared tweets. Ideally, if I didn't want to trust any platform with my data I should be able to deploy my own social media instance/node on my own personal hosting and still be able to interact with other users in the same way.\r\n\r\nThe concept of smaller services held together by open protocols is closer to what I imagine an idealized internet should be. There are open source decentralized social media platforms being developed such as Diaspora or Mastodon, but I haven't studied them enough to know if they are being built to work in this direction. I don't know if this misstep is something that starts the fall of Facebook, but hopefully the current problems would be enough to nudge the internet in a better direction, away from the large monolithic platforms capitalism seems to be urging us towards.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: https://roytang.net/category/magic/\r\n [2]: https://roytang.net/2013/03/scenes-from-a-quiz-night/\r\n [3]: https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/27/17167094/mozilla-firefox-facebook-container-tracker-blocker?utmcampaign=theverge&utmcontent=chorus&utmmedium=social&utmsource=twitter\r",

I figured it was a good time to do an update. I like doing posts like these because it provides an easy reference for me to look back and see what I was working with at a certain point in time.\r\n\r\nWhat Hardware Do I Use?\r\n\r\nDesktop. I bought a new desktop rig back in late 2015, here are the specs:\r\n\r\nCase: Silverstone Precision 10SST-PS10B\r\n  \r\nFan: 120mm internal aux fan\r\n  \r\nPSU: Cooler Master B600 V2 600W\r\n  \r\nCPU: Intel Core i5-4460\r\n  \r\nMB: ASUS H97ME\r\n  \r\nRAM: 2x DDR3 Kingston HyperX Fury 8gb 1600\r\n  \r\nGraphics: Asus GTX970 STRIX OC 4gb\r\n  \r\nSSD: Samsung 850Evo 250gb\r\n  \r\nHDD: Seagate 2tb\r\n  \r\nOS: Windows 8.1 OEM which I immediately upgraded to Windows 10 (upgrade was free at that time)\r\n\r\nThis cost significantly more than any desktop I had assembled before, but it's worth it. Still going strong up to now. Can easily handle most programming tasks I throw at it, including the notoriously resource-hungry Android development process and of course Google Chrome. Pretty good for gaming as well, although I'm not really the \"4k 120fps\" kind of gamer.\r\n\r\nI have two old monitors (a 19&8243; and a 21&#8243;) hooked up to this desktop (haven't bothered buying a new monitor...  it's on my list).\r\n\r\nLate last year I also impulse-bought a Razer Blackwidow Ultimate 2016, I'm mostly happy with it (it's my first \"real\" mechanical keyboard\") Recently one of the keys has been acting up, being a bit unresponsive but it got better after I removed the keycaps and cleaned up a bit under there.\r\n\r\na title=\"Moved the tower case under the desk to get a bit more desk space.

Will see if this works\" width=\"720\" height=\"720\" //a\r\n\r\nAs you can see above, I also have a much wider desk now than the dinky old computer table in the old post.\r\n\r\nLaptop. My only laptop currently is a work-issued Acer Aspire ES1-433-38DR. It's nice and handy and workable, but it's not even a year old and I've already had some issues with the laptop suddenly dying when it's not plugged in. For this reason (and a few other reasons like being able to publish iOS apps), I've been considering getting a Macbook Pro. (The only thing holding me back is the ridiculous price!)\r\n\r\na title=\"P20180311235708\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/zroytang/38939653510/in/dateposted-public/\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4783/38939653510441b87e717b.jpg\" alt=\"P20180311235708\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" //a\r\n\r\nGaming consoles. Gaming is one of my indulgences, so there's a few:\r\n\r\n  I still have a PS3, but it's no longer the original model from the old post. We had to buy a new one after some time because the original conked out. The PS3 is rarely used nowadays however. I still keep it around because I actually still have some backlog that I like to fantasize about finishing one day. \\Shakes fist at Ni No Kuni\\\r\n  I also have a WiiU that I purchased around 2012 or 2013 I think. My WiiU library isn't huge, but it let me play 3 different Zelda games! I often think about getting a Switch, but I want to finish what remains of my WiiU library first. (Only Twilight Princess and Earthbound remain AFAIK)\r\n  I have a PS4, purchased in October 2014. My PS4 library is larger than my WiiU one, but these days I typically only play one game on either console at a time.\r\n  I also bought a Steam Link to stream gaming from my desktop. I use my Logitech F710 wireless controller with it. It's great when I have platformers on Steam that I want to play.\r\n  Handhelds: I have both a PS Vita and a 3DS. Okay, actually I have two 3DSes, the other one is a 3DSXL. I rarely do handheld gaming anymore though, unless there's a long ride or something. I do still tend to carry one of these whenever I go out with a bag. Just in case.\r\n\r\na title=\"P20180311235839\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/zroytang/38939651450/in/dateposted-public/\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4792/389396514507203005b12b.jpg\" alt=\"P20180311235839\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" //a\r\n\r\nTV. Mid 2017 one of our 32-inch Samsung TVs in the house conked out with a bad display so we decided to buy a new one. We decided on a 43&#8243; LG Smart TV. Super happy with this, the display is much better than the previous TV. IDK how it works, I think they have some sort of software optimization that makes things look better. It's great for Netflix, Youtube, Gaming, etc.\r\n  \r\na title=\"IMG0187\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/zroytang/38939651730/in/dateposted-public/\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4801/38939651730b80aa43b3bb.jpg\" alt=\"IMG0187\" width=\"1024\" height=\"701\" //a\r\n  \r\na title=\"IMG0211\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/zroytang/38939652370/in/dateposted-public/\" data-flickr-embed=\"true\"img src=\"https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4776/38939652370714312f4dab.jpg\" alt=\"IMG0211\" width=\"1024\" height=\"768\" //a\r\n\r\nTablet. I have an 9.7&#8243; iPad Pro that I bought late 2016. I also bought an Apple Pencil for it, my main intention was to have a tool for sketching. Pretty happy with it, even though it looks pretty battle-scarred by now as I'm not the most careful user.\r\n\r\nCellphone. Wow, I was still using the Nokia 5800 in that last post. I've gone through quite a few Android smartphones since then, mostly Samsung Galaxy models, with the most recent one being a secondhand S5. I always have problems with battery life (probably due to being on data all the time) so last December I decided to buy myself an ASUS Zenfone Max 4. It's not as high-spec as the Samsung Galaxy line, but this has 10000mAH battery which means I can go all day without having to scrounge around for a charger. I haven't used my Powerbank in a while!\r\n\r\nOthers. I have a 10,0050mAH Asus Zenpower powerbank that was way more useful before I got the Zenfone. (I just now realized they're related brands). I also have a Fitbit Charge 2 for some reason. I find it more useful for tracking my walking than the mobile apps I used to use.\r\n\r\nWhat Software Do I Use?\r\n\r\nOS. Windows 10 is mostly serviceable. I'd love to have a Linux setup as well, but it's difficult to justify that as a primary OS when Windows has games! Instead I have a Linux Mint VM that I run on my desktop when I need to do Linux-y stuff.\r\n\r\nText Editor. These days any programming I do usually involves some combination of Python, JavaScript/Node or PHP, so the text editor is my weapon of choice. I tried Atom for a while, but it was a tad too slow for my tastes. I also tried Sublime Text, which is great and has everything I need but for some reason keeps nagging me to pay for it. Recently I installed VS Code, which has been pretty good so far so for now it's my main editor.\r\n\r\nOther Programming Stuff. For times that I need to dig into any Java stuff, I also still have an installation of Eclipse Mars on my machine. (I don't miss Eclipse). I also have Unity3d installed on my desktop, as I still like to pretend I have time to work on one of my gamedev projects. For SSH, I used to use Putty, but lately I discovered the great \"Bash on Ubuntu on Windows\". The name is a handful, but it makes doing Linux shell stuff like SSH and curl and whatever a lot easier.\r\n\r\nWeb Browser. Most of my work is web-related and I often use cloud resources, so the web browser is important. I recently switched from Google Chrome to Mozilla Firefox as my main browser, since the latest Firefox promised a bunch of speed improvements. TBH, I can't quite tell the difference.\r\n\r\nOffice Suite. As mentioned above, I often use cloud resources, so it's mostly GMail, Google Calendar, Google Drive and Google Docs/Sheets for my needs. I also have a local installation of LibreOffice because sometimes I have to open Excel files that are hundreds of megabytes large and Google Sheets refuses to import it. For cloud storage, my preference is Dropbox.\r\n\r\nNote-taking. I've grown fond of Google Keep. It's lightweight and handy enough for my usage, and the Android widget means I can use it to capture random thoughts and ideas throughout the day. On the iPad I also use NotesPlus if I happend to be in a meeting where I feel like writing notes down with the Apple Pencil.\r\n\r\nCommunications. Usually some combination of Slack + Skype for work-related stuff, although some clients prefer WeChat or WhatsApp so I have those too. For personal comms, it's mostly Viber and FB Messenger and sometimes Discord.\r\n\r\nSketching. On my iPad I use and am a big fan of the Procreate app for digital sketches, which I think I even paid for a while back.\r\n\r\nOdds and Ends. I have a bunch of other software utilities I often recommend. I use VLC Media Player for watching stuff on my desktop (doesn't everybody?). I use Space Sniffer to check disk usage. Audacity for the rare instance that I have to do some kind of audio editing.\r\n\r\nAll the photos in this post are available as a Flickr dataset: https://www.flickr.com/photos/zroytang/sets/72157688688295540\r\n\r\n [1]: https://roytang.net/2010/06/the-setup/\r\n [2]: https://roytang.net/2017/07/hardware-review-steam-link/\r\n [3]: https://roytang.net/2013/06/handheld-gaming-2013-playstation-vita-vs-nintendo-3ds/\r\n [4]: http://www.lg.com/us/tvs/lg-43UH6500-4k-uhd-tv\r\n [5]: https://atom.io/\r\n [6]: https://www.sublimetext.com/\r\n [7]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\r\n [8]: https://www.eclipse.org/mars/\r\n [9]: https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/\r\n [10]: https://www.libreoffice.org/\r\n [11]: http://keep.google.com/\r\n [12]: https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html\r\n [13]: http://www.uderzo.it/mainproducts/spacesniffer/\r\n [14]: https://www.audacityteam.org/\r\n\r\n Comments\r\n\r\nComment by shibainu on 2018-03-15 13:34:00 +0000\r\ndoesnt the BoUoW (Bash on Ubuntu on Windows) introduce a lot of other bloatware?\r\n\r\n Comment by roy on 2018-03-15 23:35:29 +0000\r\nIDK actually.

I asked my first question there and also wrote my first answer in September 2008, which was the month the site launched, so I was pretty much there from the beginning. The site was a huge boon to programmers when it first came out, because the internet as a venue for asking questions and answers back then was a horrible fragmented landscape of small forums and mailing lists and sites like Experts Exchange, all of which were terribly designed. (StackOverflow founder Joel Spolsky talks about this a bit in a recent retrospective post.)\r\n\r\nStackOverflow changed all that, providing a one-stop Q&A site where programmers were incentivized to contribute through gamification and achievements. It became my first port of call for asking technical questions. (My question history says I have asked 98 questions through the years -- going through them was a bit fun, it was kind of a fun reminder of stuff I used to work on through the years.) For the first few years, I was even reasonably active in answering questions -- 44 of the 52 questions in my answer history were from 2008-2011. I even got a few answers accepted! My usage tapered off after that, mostly restricted to asking new questions whenever I was studying some new technology. But still even now I'm told that I'm within the top 13% of the reputation score on the site. I'm far from being Jon Skeet or anything, but safe to say I'm an entrenched user.\r\n\r\nSo you can imagine that it piqued my interest when I came upon April Wensel's Twitter thread on the toxicity of StackOverlow and her subsequent blog post about it. At first I was skeptical, it felt like an overreaction. I mean sure, there's the occasional rude jerk who responds unpleasantly but that's not unheard of on either the internet or IRL. And as far as I recall, I had never personally encountered any toxicity during the time I was active there and I never felt unwelcome on the site. But as I read more details and examples and reddit threads and so on, I got a better sense of both StackOverflow's reputation and its problems. Issues that were difficult for me to see as someone who not only has a long history with the site but also as someone with a lot of experience in software development.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, it's easy to recognize that StackOverflow has a beginner problem. Beginners as in beginner devs, especially ones who haven't yet mastered the crucial skill of how to ask questions. Programmers have a reputation for wanting to get to the point Given the site's reputation, it can be intimidating for newbies to participate. The \"Ask Question\" screen isn't exactly super welcoming. More senior developers might find it easier to figure out what the rules and culture of the site are and behave accordingly, but for newbies or people who aren't super confident I can understand why it might be a harrowing experience.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't help that the community responds the way it does to poor questions: downvotes, rude comments, getting your question closed as a duplicate. And probably worst of all is the negative karma score. It can be pretty discouraging for people who aren't used to negative feedback or who have anxiety or lack self-confidence.\r\n\r\nPossibly related: everyone I know who does have a StackOverflow account also happens to be a gamer person who at one point or another also indulged in online multiplayer games. I wonder if this points to a general correlation between gamers and people who don't mind the culture of StackOverflow. It kind of makes sense because gamers are used to responding to negative feedback and figuring out the rules of a system. And people who play online multiplayer games are likely used to even more toxicity than a simple internet forum.\r\n\r\nDuring the week I had this blog post in my drafts folder, StackOverflow released their own take on the matter, outlining some initial steps to improve in this regard. The acknowledgement of the problem and the initial steps are great signs. Hopefully they can also look at improving downvotes (perhaps by requiring the downvoter to provide a reason for the downvote) and duplicate handling (perhaps by giving the original poster a time period to respond to suggested duplicates and indicate if and why he doesn't consider them duplicates.)\r\n\r\nI don't 100% agree with everything April Wensel said. For one thing, I still understand and appreciate the purpose of StackOverflow as being a repository of knowledge that is supposed to benefit the community at large and not just the specific asker. And I don't mind that some prefer to trim away pleasantries from questions. StackOverflow optimizes for the future reader, not for the asker. This bears out in how useful StackOverflow is in Google search results. In this regard, I believe StackOverflow has mostly achieved its goals.\r\n\r\nBut in many ways mentality this makes it inappropriate for certain types of questions. It's not so good for newer devs that need to be walked through their code or don't have enough experience to even know how to ask the right questions. And as a developer starts working on more advanced topics and more specialized libraries, the usefulness of general-purpose sites like StackOverflow start to wane. Over the past few years I've found myself relying more on narrower forums like the Github issues list for a library I'm trying to use, or the vendor's official support channels.\r\n\r\nPerhaps StackOverflow has held a monopoly on the developer Q&A space for too long, and while they're figuring out these things, there might be an opportunity for a new breed of Q&A sites with different kinds of focus to emerge.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: https://stackoverflow.com\r\n [2]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/99271/c-sharp-com-office-automation-rpc-e-sys-call-failed\r\n [3]: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/99302/would-it-be-useful-to-include-the-class-name-and-variable-name-in-any-nullpointe/99512#99512\r\n [4]: https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2018/04/06/the-stack-overflow-age/\r\n [5]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/18494/roy-tang?tab=questions\r\n [6]: https://stackoverflow.com/users/18494/roy-tang?tab=answers\r\n [7]: https://medium.com/@Aprilw/suffering-on-stack-overflow-c46414a34a52\r\n [8]: https://www.reddit.com/r/ProgrammerHumor/comments/8c61bk/askinga_questiononstackoverflowin_a_nutshell/\r\n [9]: http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html\r",

Except for Barangay/SK elections. I've never voted in Barangay elections.\r\n\r\nI understand that voting is a civic duty, and I have no real justification for shirking it. But the fact is that my level of awareness re: barangay-level government is very low. I have no idea what their responsibilities or jurisdiction is supposed to be. I know they have some sort of role in dispute resolution, low level law enforcement, and disaster relief efforts, but that's about it. If I have a local issue, I'm not likely to think about bringing it up to the Barangay. To be fair, bringing it up to the Mayor's office wouldn't be my first thought either, but I'd definitely think of that before the Barangay.\r\n\r\nUntil today, I didn't even know what geographic scope was covered by my Barangay. (I looked it up just now.) I had no idea who were the incumbent Barangay captain and kagawads. I have never had need to conduct business with them. The things that concern me about the government are more often city-wide (traffic) or nation-wide (taxes, internet, bloody anti-crime campaigns, loss of national territory) in scope. There's also the perception that many Barangays are largely a waste of taxpayer money with many of the officials being useless people who mainly indulge in meaningless projects like local basketball leagues.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't help that there is very little information about the candidates for those positions. Their campaign posters are little more than faces and names, indistinguishable from one another. They try to make \"clever\" initialisms to improve name recall but such attempts always fall flat. They annoy residents with their blaring campaign jingles that are all medley and no substance. Even if I decided to today to troop to the voting center and choose for someone to vote, I would have no idea who would be deserving. To be fair, the same criticisms can be said of the campaigns for national office -- but in those cases there is often a lot more information available about the candidates from other sources.\r\n\r\nI understand that this is partially my fault -- I don't really engage much with the community. If I really wanted to, I suppose they had some sort of miting de avance that I could have attended to get more information about the candidates. Or maybe I could have gotten into more discussions with others in my local community to find out more. Unfortunately, engaging in the community at that level might require more social effort than I am willing to spend.\r\n\r\nI also understand that my situation is partly the result of privilege. The privilege of not needing to invoke the services of this particular branch of local government and thus not really caring too much about them. It might even make some kind of sense that the ones voting on those positions would be the ones who are more affected by it, and not people like me who hardly interact with the Barangay at all.\r\n\r\nIn a bid to understand more, I started a reddit thread about it. The responses mostly confirm my perception that the Barangay matters more for poor people and that there are a lot of incompetent/useless Barangay officials. The best answer tells us there is a significant gap between the current state of the Barangay and the ideal state, and that a good Barangay would do wonders for the residents. I'm not certain what would need to be done to close that gap.\r\n\r\nIt's too late for me to vote in today's elections given my lack of knowledge. Maybe in the future it's something I can look into.\r\n\r",

Basically a combination of natural language processing + text-to-speech that can emulate human speaking patterns. It's not that much of a breakthrough (more like putting several different things together), but it's impressive and is a good indicator of where we are with regards to true conversant AI. On the other hand, it's a staged demo, it's yet to be seen how robust the technology will turn out to be in real life. And I doubt it passes the Turing test. The ovation from the crowd was understandable.\r\n\r\nOutside the technical aspect, there is another concern that many in the tech community (outside of the crowd) immediately raised though: this is deception. In the demo, the assistant calls up restaurants and basically pretends to be a real human. It adds \"umms\" and other human-like pauses to sound like a human. Not only is that deception, it's creepy deception. And totally unnecessary for the proposed use cases. If it was obviously a bot calling a restaurant to make a reservation, it could still work, the staff receiving the call would just need to get used to it. People already know how to talk to voicemail and answering machines and dial-in menus so it's not too far of a leap.\r\n\r\nIt's problematic from an ethics point of view so there was some blowback. Google got the hint, and soon after announced that they were staying ahead of the ethical concerns and that the AI will declare itself to the other party. This doesn't erase the concerns about what happens when this kind of technology becomes widespread and available outside of Google though. (This may not be a concern for a long time to come, since the computational power involved here is almost certainly not yet available to the normal consumer.)\r\n\r\nIt is an understandable fear. While we have reaped the benefits of technological advances over the past couple of decades, there are almost always bad actors that use the new technology for nefarious purposes. Mostly scams or to try to sell you things. See: emails from Nigerian princes, spam SMS messages trying to get you to transfer load, social media bots trying to promote their agenda, and so on. The future scenario of some bad guy robocalling your non-tech savvy parents and trying to scam them is not too far-fetched. One can assume regulation or such would keep them in line, but as you know, bad guys don't always follow the rules.\r\n\r\nScience fiction of course is replete with examples of AI that can mimic human communications, such as Iron Man's Jarvis or the droids from Star Wars, or Data from Star Trek. I believe none of those examples have human \"umms\" probably because that seems obviously creepy for some reason. (They do use human expressions of course, like C3PO's \"Oh my goodness!\"). I'm also reminded of Tad Williams' Otherworld series of books, of which I don't remember much but I do recall that AIs were required to answer truthfully if asked whether they were AIs. (It was very insulting to ask a human if it was an AI.)\r\n\r\nGiven how much we are able to imagine it, such tech is probably inevitable in the trajectory of human advancement (assuming we don't bomb ourselves to extinction). I'm sure eventually humanity will be able to adapt (soon inbound phone calls will require some kind of captcha), but there's bound to be some transition time where it's problematic.\r\n\r",

One thing I was hoping to find there was this TODO text file that I kept throughout the years I worked there, even as I moved from one computer to another. It was a very long, append-only file, accumulated over some number of years. It served as some combination of task list, temporary clipboard, notes repository and logging of random thoughts throughout the day. Sadly, I could no longer find the file.\r\n\r\nI'm a sucker for that kind of stuff -- things that remind you of your journey and the passage of time and give you a glimpse of who you were and what you were doing at a certain point in time. It's part of why I still keep up with this blogging thing. My target audience is 99% future me. Every so often I'll wonder about something like \"What year was it that I lost my eyeglasses to the sea?\" or \"Who did I vote for in the 2010 elections again?\" (In hindsight, some poor choices there.) or \"When did I first travel to Hong Kong?\" This blog has been around for a while -- the archives go all the way back to 2002. (Not that I was already on WordPress and my own domain back then, I just keep importing all the content as I move platforms.) This blog serves as an extension of my memory, which as you know is fragile and easily confused, especially as one grows older. Time ravages your memory, and as you grow older the years start to blur together, and it's nice to have an easy index of the sort of things happening to you back during those days.\r\n\r\nIn the parlance of my old job, it serves as an audit trail of your life.\r\n\r\nIt's also part of why I'm not in a rush to quit social media despite all the privacy issues involved: I find that they provide a useful service because they help keep track of my history. (That they are using this data to try to sell advertising is annoying, but that's a subject for another post.). I also do regular extracts of all my data on the social media sites so that I still have access to them if things go south.\r\n\r\nAside from public writings and musings on the internet, I also tend to keep personal logs. The text file I mentioned in the opening paragraph was one such example. Once cloud-based note-taking services became popular, I tended to latch onto them. It was EverNote for the longest time, before their free tier restrictions became untenable for me. I eventually settled on some combination of Google Drive + Dropbox + Google Keep. Most of my writings are on Google Drive at the moment, while other files (pictures etc) are on Dropbox, and todos/quick notes on Google Keep.\r\n\r\nSince 2015, I've been gradually getting more and more detailed with my logging. Initially I was just logging things once a week as a sort of weekly review document on EverNote. I kept tracking more new things like daily meals, and expenses until eventually I ended up with a day-to-day spreadsheet with a whole bunch of columns. (This is how I've managed to make detailed yearly reviews.) One of my side projects at the moment is even my own personal tracking/logging system, I have a small prototype running, but nowhere near enough functionality that I want. Like many of side projects it's fallen into some kind of black hole. Ah, maybe I'll finish it someday.\r\n\r\nA couple of months ago I was going through some old boxes that I thought contained some old high-school notebooks and found that I had thrown them out some time before. Sadness. I had some sweet drawings in some of those. It would have been a lot easier to archive them digitally nowadays since I have a scanner at home now. Oh well. If I could send some messages back to my younger self, \"Keep your old notebooks and log files\" would be among my highest priorities. (Probably after \"Buy Bitcoin\", \"Buy Apple stock\", and \"Keep your G1 Transformers\")\r\n\r\nSometimes I wonder if this tendency to look back at the past is some kind of sign of growing old. I've certainly appreciated it more as I grew older. I mean, when you're young and stupid  you kind of feel invincible and that you'll live forever and remember everything. I remember at some point in high school I had convinced myself that I had something close to a photographic memory. These days eh, if you ask me where I was last Thursday I'll have to check my spreadsheet. For me, I still consider the ability to record a lot of our day to day lives as one of the better things that technology has brought us. Some might say we are recording too much, but hey it's my life right. I shouldn't be deprived of those memories just because my flesh is starting to fail. (And maybe in the future I can use all this data to model and simulate my consciousness and personality -- oh wait, Black Mirror did that already.)\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n [1]: https://roytang.net/2004/11/my-eyeglasses-belong-to-the-sea/\r\n [2]: https://roytang.net/2010/05/elections-2010-my-ballot/\r\n [3]: https://roytang.net/2004/04/roy-goes-to-hk/\r\n [4]: https://roytang.net/archives/\r\n [5]: https://roytang.net/2018/03/rethinking-facebook/\r\n [6]: https://evernote.com/\r",

Due to the author's glacial writing pace, at this point the TV series went past the point that the novels had reached. Thus nobody -- book readers or tv viewers -- knew what events would unfold in the story. I usually don't watch the episodes until a few days after they air. On the day the first episode aired I found while scrolling through my social media feeds that one of my friends (who shall remain nameless) posted what turned out to be the resolution to the cliffhanger ending of both the previous TV season and the last available book. It was of course followed by immediate comments of \"Spoiler!\" from me and a few other people.\r\n\r\nSome people might say, what's the big deal? When you're invested in a story, getting unintentionally spoiled as to future plot points is a terrible feeling. It robs of you of the the experience, as you now go into the story with certain expectations. You only ever get one chance to watch/read/experience a story for the first time. If you enjoyed that experience, you should be considerate of others and not take that same experience away from them. (Unless they ask for it of course.) Sure, it's just a story. But hey, life is stories.\r\n\r\nThe need to talk about what happened in a story is certainly understandable. You're excited about the story and you can't wait to talk to people about it and tell them what you think and speculate about what happens next and so on. It's akin to coming back to school/work on Monday and discussing what happened in your favorite TV shows over the weekend. (Back in high school we probably had multiple Monday morning conversations along the lines of \"Can you believe Goku is still running down the snake road?\")\r\n\r\nAnd when it's you and your buddies talking about it over the water cooler after everybody's seen the episode in question that's fine. But in the modern age, we have social media, and with social media comes the tendency to broadcast your thoughts to the world. If you're not careful you're going to accidentally spoil everyone.\r\n\r\nI'm writing about this because of Avengers Infinity War of course. I normally post a spoiler-free review on Facebook after watching a movie, but there's so much to unpack in this movie I had to get down my thoughts and write a spoiler-filled review over on NedStarkDies.com. Marvel themselves were well aware of the dangers spoilers poised in ruining people's experience of the movie. In the weeks running up to the movie, they ran a campaign to encourage people to avoid spreading spoilers using the hashtag #ThanosDemandsYourSilence. The campaign included a letter from the Russo brothers and a video message from the cast. The campaign seems to have been largely successful, which is amazing to me.\r\n\r\nSide note: I wasn't able to watch the movie on the opening day, so it was a bit brave for me to still be scanning my feeds in the days before I was able to watch. But I think I got away mostly unscathed. I will say however, that I do consider as mild spoilers reactions like \"I need a hug\" or \"that wasn't good for kids\". I mean, that already implies the tone of the ending. But then again, I'm probably more finicky about spoilers than most -- these days I tend to avoid all but the first trailer for any movies I plan to watch since I feel that succeeding trailers already tend to spoil too much.\r\n\r\nOne last spoiler-related anecdote: my brothers and I are big fans of profession wrestling (WWE). We used to follow all the storylines and whatnot. Back in 2005, up-and-comer Dave Batista (who also happens to appear in Infinity War) got his first title shot at Wrestlemania 21. One of my brothers was unable to watch the show at the time that it aired on local TV. But he didn't want us to spoil the match outcome for him until he got a chance to find a copy that he could watch. We didn't want to download it because it would have taken too long on our very slow internet back then. It took him a couple of months to find a store that had DVD copies of the event. As the lady behind the counter handed him the DVD she commented something along the lines of \"Batista was so good in this event sir, he became the champion!\"\r\n\r\n [1]: http://nedstarkdies.com/avengers-infinity-war/\r\n [2]: https://twitter.com/search?q=%23ThanosDemandsYourSilence&src=typd\r",

Some years ago I had read one of the author's previous books, The Four Hour Workweek, and I wasn't too impressed. It was interesting at least, but a lot of the advice seemed either difficult to apply to my personal situation or involved doing stuff I wasn't really interested in (i.e. sales and marketing and whatnot). But this new book intrigued me -- it's a collection of life advice from \"mentors\", basically successful people from a wild variety of fields including entrepreneurs, celebrities, venture capitalists, athletes, chefs, scholars, bloggers, authors, and so on. I'm always a sucker for this sort of thing -- even if I don't learn anything myself personally, it's always interesting to learn how other people approach life. Spoilers: I enjoyed the book.\r\n\r\nThere's some common themes that are often repeated among the different mentors in the book:\r\n\r\n  Many recommend some form of meditation, whether it be transcendental or something else\r\n  Many stress how important it was to them to be able to say \"no\" to unnecessary commitments\r\n  A lot of them recommend some form of nonconformity and taking the time to find your own path\r\n  Some great examples of learning from failures and really makes you think about how we often overreact to failures that later on turn out to be not that big a deal\r\n  I was often pleasantly surprised by how well-read some of the celebrities turned out to be\r\n  Each mentor also gives a short list of books they often give out as gifts, and there's a \\lot\\ of interesting books mentioned, I'll probably try to read quite a few of them\r\n\r\nI also started using this function in the Kindle app which let's me highlight some parts and save them for later. I would send those quotes to Google Keep. (Although to be honest there were a lot I didn't bother to note down, mostly because I was lazy.) Here are the ones I did manage to save:\r\n\r\n \"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you’ve got to focus on. But that’s not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I’m actually as proud of the things we haven’t done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things.\" –Steve Jobs\r\n \r\n \"I say no to nearly everything. I make a lot fewer short-term compromises. I aspire to only work with people who I can work with forever, to invest my time in activities that are a joy unto themselves, and to focus on the extremely long term.\" -- Naval Ravikant, CEO and co-founder of AngelList\r\n \r\n \"God will not have his work made manifest by cowards.\"—Ralph Waldo Emerson\r\n \r\n \"Desire is a contract that you make with yourself to be unhappy until you get what you want.\" -- Naval Ravikant, CEO and co-founder of AngelList\r\n \r\n \"First, whenever possible, connect with others. Second, with enthusiasm, strive always to create fun and delight for others. And third, lean into each moment and encounter expecting magic—or miracles.\" -- Adam Robinson, educator, freelance author, and US Chess Federation life master\r\n \r\n _\"Too often, I hear people effectively given advice that is consistent with sunk cost fallacies. I certainly heard it a lot. \"You’ve spent X years learning Y, you can’t just up and leave and now do Z,\" they say. I think this is flawed advice because it weighs too heavily the time behind you, which can’t be changed, and largely discounts the time\" -- Peter Attia, Surgeon\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n \r\n _\"Yet change is usually stressful, and after a certain age, most people don’t like to change. When you are 16, your entire life is change, whether you like it or not. Your body is changing, your mind is changing, your relationships are changing—everything is in flux. You are busy inventing yourself. By the time you are 40, you don’t want change. You want stability. But in the twenty-first century, you won’t be able to enjoy that luxury. If you try to hold on to some stable identity, some stable job, some stable worldview, you will be left behind, and the world will fly by you. So people will need to be extremely resilient and emotionally balanced to sail through this never-ending storm, and to deal with very high levels of stress.\" -- Yuval Noah Harari, author of Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n \r\n _\"So you have no choice but to really get to know yourself better. Know who you are and what you really want from life. This is, of course, the oldest advice in the book: know thyself. But this advice has never been more urgent than in the 21st century. Because now you have competition. Google, Facebook, Amazon, and the government are all relying on big data and machine learning to get to know you better and better. We are not living in the era of hacking computers—we are living in the era of hacking humans. Once the corporations and governments know you better than you know yourself, they could control and manipulate you and you won’t even realize it. So if you want to stay in the game, you have to run faster than Google. Good luck!\" -- Yuval Noah Harari again\r\n  \r\n_ \r\n\r\nWhenever I read a book like this it refreshes me a little bit and gives me a better sense of perspective and inspires me to do more things that I want to do and maybe live life a little bit more on my own terms. (Whether I actually execute on that, well that's a different matter all together.)",

        "content": "---\r\nauthor: roy\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2018-06-16 01:00:49\r\ntags:\r\nstandard\r\ntournament-report\r\nMagic the Gathering\r\nTravels\r\ntitle: Kuala Lumpur and the MTG25A RPTQ\r\ntype: post\r\nurl: /2018/06/kuala-lumpur-and-the-mtg25a-rptq/\r\n---\r\n\r\nI had an out of country trip last weekend to Kuala Lumpur to play Magic, but I was a bit tempted to not write about it all. The reason being that inevitably after one of these MTG-related trips the first thing people ask me is \"Nanalo ka ba?\" (Did you win?) and this time, the answer was sadly no. (Let's get the spoilers out of the way early shall we.) However, I realized that not all stories have to have happy endings. Sometimes the journey itself is the story.\r\n\r\nBesides, it was my first trip ever to Malaysia, and as I like to use this blog to remember past events, it's probably a good idea to write a little bit about it. If you're here just to get my opinions on Malaysia and want to skip the MTG bits here you go:\r\n\r\n  Weather was hot, but nowhere near as hot as manila\r\n  Look and feel more like Singapore than Manila. I was expecting it to be closer to Manila, but I guess with the proximity to Singapore the similarity makes more sense\r\n  Food is more expensive than Manila, again probably due to Singapore being a few hours away by bus\r\n  I didn't get to sample the public transpo, we mostly either walked or took a Grab anywhere. We didn't really have time to do anything touristy anyway as we were either prepping for the RPTQ or tired from doing poorly.\r\n  I did like how the airport was like 50km away from the city proper. It's one of the terrible things about NAIA is that there's no space between the airport and Metro Manila. There's also a fixed grab rate when travelling from the airport, so that was cool.\r\n  I still have 100+ extra ringgit. I'm selling, if you're interested LOL.\r\n\r\nNow for the MTG bits: I was actually not intending to do any foreign travel this year, mostly because I had decided to lay low with MTG for a while after last year's lackluster performances. I was so decided to skip standard for this year that during that last trip I left my standard deck with @switchfollows in Singapore so he would have some cards for the GP they have in June. Around February, another friend @aleksfelipe tells me that he has a deferred invite to the 25A RPTQ happening in Kuala Lumpur in June. The format for that RPTQ happened to be Team Unified Standard, so Alex would need to bring two more players as his teammates. Among our old playgroup, it was really only him and me and Switch who were still sort of playing regularly and at a kind of competitive level, so we were the chosen team!\r\n\r\nOf course, the problems of card availability came up. Switch was in Singapore, and he had most of the standard-legal cards with him. Alex and I were in the Philippines, with much less cards available. We had been planning to purchase the standard challenger decks when they came out, so that helped get us a bunch of other cards we needed. The timing was tough too. Dominaria would be coming out around a month before the RPTQ, which meant we didn't know what decks we could play until then. We also didn't want to spend too much resources on singles, since the trip was already costing us some money. Between the usual work business and the fact that our card pool was split across two countries, we also did not have time for playtesting. As the date of the RPTQ drew near, it was increasingly likely that we would need to assemble our decks on-site and just do our testing there.\r\n\r\nWe did manage to get a bit of support from a local gaming store that let us borrow some cards we were missing, so shout out to Roll Play Game Lounge for their support (although we totally fumbled the ball.)\r\n\r\nWe eventually settled on playing RB midrange, GB constrictor, and UB Improvise (\"Anguished Affinity\"). We decided against even trying to assemble a UW control deck because (a) we were missing too many pieces (mainly {{ card }}Disallow{{ /card }} and the white sideboard mythics -- {{ card }}Lyra Dawnbringer{{ /card }} and {{ card }}History of Benalia{{ /card }}); and (b) we felt that piloting a control deck required a comprehensive understanding of the metagame, which we didn't have with our limited prep.\r\n\r\nOur configuration ended up being Switch in Seat A with RB midrange, me in Seat B with GB constrictor and Alex in Seat C with UB Improvise. Here is the GB list I piloted:\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist title=\"GB Constrictor\" }}\r\n  \r\n[Creatures]\r\n  \r\n4 Llanowar Elves\r\n  \r\n4 Glint-Sleeve Siphoner\r\n  \r\n4 Winding Constrictor\r\n  \r\n3 Jadelight Ranger\r\n  \r\n2 Rishkar, Peema Renegade\r\n  \r\n2 Thrashing Brontodon\r\n  \r\n4 Ravenous Chupacabra\r\n  \r\n2 Blistering Hydra\r\n  \r\n2 Verdurous Gearhulk\r\n  \r\n[/Creatures]\r\n  \r\n[Spells]\r\n  \r\n4 Adventurous Impulse\r\n  \r\n2 Aethersphere Harvester\r\n  \r\n[/Spells]\r\n  \r\n[Lands]\r\n  \r\n4 Woodland Cemetery\r\n  \r\n4 Blooming Marsh\r\n  \r\n4 Aether Hub\r\n  \r\n4 Swamp\r\n  \r\n7 Forest\r\n  \r\n[/Lands]\r\n  \r\n[Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n4 Doomfall\r\n  \r\n1 Vraska, Relic Seeker\r\n  \r\n1 Nissa, Vital Force\r\n  \r\n1 Shapers' Sanctuary\r\n  \r\n3 Lifecrafter's Bestiary\r\n  \r\n2 Cast Down\r\n  \r\n2 Fatal Push\r\n  \r\n1 Aethersphere Harvester\r\n  \r\n[/Sideboard]\r\n  \r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\nBecause of how hot it was and how we'd been sweating a lot during the trip and how we somehow decided to all play black decks, we jokingly referred to ourselves as Team Black Pawis. This turned out to be an unlucky team name LOL. We managed to practice a few matchups (including with a proxied UW control) on-site Friday and Saturday. Our red matchups didn't feel too good, but it was too late to switch. All we could do was hope for the best.\r\n\r\nAs for the tournament itself:\r\n\r\n  The turnout was huge, with 82 teams opting to play. I think as many as ten Philippine teams and probably a bit more Singaporean teams. The organizer actually had to switch to a larger venue to accommodate everyone (which caused not a bit of inconvenience from groups who had chosen to book early). I suppose the team nature of the event and the fact that an invitee could bring his friends along vastly increased interest in the tournament.\r\n  Speaking of the larger venue, it could indeed hold all the teams, but their airconditioning was not up to it, so we ended up sweating a lot throughout the event. Team Black Pawis indeed.\r\n  We did quite poorly. Dropped after four losses and only one win which was a no-show. I didn't even win a match. A lot of it was due to lack of preparation and poor positioning/deck choice.\r\n\r\nLosing of course was a feel-bad, as it always is for me. My teammates were not quite as spikey as I was, so they took it a bit better. I mentioned to Alex that his invite might have gone to better use if he had looked for other players who were actively playing standard at the time. He correctly responded that the thought never crossed his mind, that the opportunity to play in a team tournament with friends who he had known for a while was what he wanted. It was a good reminder for me that winning isn't always everything. The trip was not a waste since we did enjoy our prep time and had some fun moments and catching up with each other.\r\n\r\nIn hindsight/afterwards:\r\n\r\n  We sent Switch off back to Singapore with his RB deck. We felt that monored probably would've been a simpler choice, and far easier to pilot as well, so he might decide to switch that up for his GP next week.\r\n  I'll probably still try to play the same deck in standard PPTQs before Core 2019 comes out, with minor adjustments. At the very least, will probably add 1-2 {{ card }}Blossoming Defense{{ /card }} somewhere in the 75.\r\n  Team Unified Standard was a fun puzzle. I think we did get the general solution in the days leading up the tournament, but lack of card availability and flexibility left us unable to execute that.\r\n  For a while I tried to metagame the seating arrangements but I gave up because realistically there's no way to predict what other teams would do. One of our opponents did give us a good insight though: they put the quick monored deck in the middle seat, so that no matter what, his decisions would be quicker and he would have more time to advise the other team members.\r\n  Alex and I are also qualified for PH Nationals in July, so that's something to look forward to. Unfortunately, that tournament happens in week 1 of a new meta, so I'll probably be playing the same deck again, with whatever adjustments needed for Core 2019.\r\n\r\nJust for fun, I also started compiling a trip playlist. Then I stopped because I could only remember three relevant songs:\r\n\r\n  Call Me Maybe -- was playing on the radio during the Grab trip from the airport, and for some reason it got stuck in my head\r\n  All Star -- only because during our late night testing we ended up watching a few of Jon Sudano's videos.\r\n  Be Prepared -- this was the main takeaway from the defeat! For me personally, the biggest takeaway is that preparation is always important.\r\n\r\nMy new, upgraded set of rules (an improvement over the ones from the GP Singapore post:\r\n\r\n  Be prepared\r\n  Read the cards\r\n  Mulligan well\r\n  Think before scooping\r\n  Life is unfair\r\n\r\nSo much for \"laying low\". Ah Magic, you are such a hard game to quit.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://roytang.net/2017/12/grand-prix-singapore-2017-tournament-report/\r\n [2]: https://twitter.com/switchfollows\r\n [3]: https://twitter.com/aleksfelipe\r\n [4]: https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/feature/challenger-decks-lists-2018-02-23\r\n [5]: https://magic.wizards.com/en/products/dominaria\r\n [6]: https://www.facebook.com/kcrollplay/\r\n [7]: https://open.spotify.com/user/12136350922/playlist/0yXbBinhLNAaSAVNaIl8pd\r",

I thought I would post about something here. And I've decided (just now), that I need to post more frivolous things, a bit of dumb blogging as some might say. Today I will talk about what games I've been playing in the whatever little spare time I've been able to scrounge up. I find that if I don't distract myself with some gaming, my brain tends to overthink about silly things like problems and deadlines that I can't do anything about anyway. Most of these are for Steam, because someone borrowed my PS4 and hasn't given it back yet.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  I started playing Borderlands 2 again after I randomly saw a friend playing it on Steam and I invited him to a coop. I had forgotten that I had finished this before on console with my brother, but WTH it’s fun and there are achievements to be had. And there's a bunch of silly quests like this one: \r\n    figure id=\"attachment2711\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"img class=\"wp-image-2711 size-large\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201807072143021-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201807072143021-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201807072143021-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201807072143021-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201807072143021-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"I haven't done this quest yet, because I currently have like 150k of in-game money and discovered that dying takes away 7% of my total. Not sure where I want to spend that money though lol/figcaption/figure/li \r\n    \r\n      I’ve also been playing Skyrim, as I’m only one achievement away from completion, but that last achievement requires so much grinding (need to kill a legendary dragon) that it’s a bit of a drag. This is my second \"full\" playthrough of the game, where \"full\" = I didn't just spend 15 minutes in character generation and then get bored before even getting to Rivenwood. My first run was with the vanilla version of the game when it first came out in 2011 (yup, I've been playing this game on and off for 7 years), and during this second run I've managed to complete the DLC content as well. I still enjoy Skyrim, despite its age, and I have a lot of thoughts, it probably deserves its own blog post as a full review. As soon as I kill that legendary dragon. \r\n        figure id=\"attachment2712\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"img class=\"size-large wp-image-2712\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201805272354231-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201805272354231-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201805272354231-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201805272354231-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201805272354231-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"Such scintillating conversations in this game/figcaption/figure/li \r\n        \r\n          For some unfathomable reason I also started Beat Hazard again after I randomly decided to purchase a network switch on Lazada. The network switch means my Steam Link is alive again and I can now tolerate playing Beat Hazard since I get to sit on a couch some distance from the TV. It’s a fun game although it does tend to give one eyestrain if you play too long. And there’s a ton of achievements too and they seem totally achievable despite this being an action game (Obviously my secondary motivator for picking up old games again, aside from fun, is achievements -- maybe I’ll pick up Hoard again soon lol)\r\n          Eternal of course, one of my daily habits. I’m actually also one achievement away from completing this, which is the draft master one. I started my draft master run about a week ago with around 42,000 gold, let’s see if that’s enough to get me there by end of month. So far I’m at 16,000+ gold left and only at gold, doesn't seem likely I can make it. The new draft format seems fun though. I’ve actually gotten a lot of playtime out of Eternal considering it’s F2P for me. \r\n            figure id=\"attachment2714\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"img class=\"size-large wp-image-2714\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201710252049401-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201710252049401-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201710252049401-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201710252049401-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201710252049401-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"I've actually played enough Eternal that I regularly make Master rank (usually within the last week of the month) and my favorite was when I beat the top-ranked player at that time (I mulliganned this hand obviously)/figcaption/figure/li \r\n            \r\n              Still doing my once a week Street Fighter V sessions, although it’s really tough to find online matches, not sure if it's because I'm perpetually stuck in bronze. I am net earning FM though, and my favorite character Cody just came out so that's cool. I won some money on Paydro the other day which was conveniently just enough to purchase his prisoner costume. Cody's SFV version feels so weird without the rock though lol. \r\n                figure id=\"attachment2715\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"img class=\"size-large wp-image-2715\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201807141458401-1024x576.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201807141458401-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201807141458401-300x169.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201807141458401-768x432.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/201807141458401-600x338.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /figcaption class=\"wp-caption-text\"This is probably the only costume I'm willing to pay for in this game/figcaption/figure/li \r\n                \r\n                  I also recently started going through the tutorials of Blazblue Chronophantasma Extend, but I’ve only done like 2-3 play sessions so far. Probably won’t do this too often as I’m terrible with the ArcSys games so I can’t really dedicate too much time to them. But I like how they look and I think I got this from some Humble Bundle, so probably better to play this than spend money on Cross Tag Battle which I would be equally bad at.\r\n                  All of the above I’m playing on Steam, but this month’s PS+ also gave me Zero Escape: Zero Time Dilemma on Vita which I had been eyeing on steam so it's a little bit of a lucky break. I played (and platinum'ed the second game VLR on the Vita as well, although I've never played the first game 999.)  Hopefully I find some time for it, I imagine it’s the sort of game where I need some focused time to play it./ul \r\n                \r\n                Whenever people ask me if I'm looking forward to game XX coming out in a few months, I now often reply \"I'm still trying to finish games from 2011!\", this is so true. I mean, when people ask if I'm getting a Nintendo Switch and there's like Xenoblade Chronicles 2, Octopath Traveller, Mario Odyssey and so on, which is like two or three hundred hours of gameplay altogether, where am I gonna find time for that? Kingdom Hearts 3 is coming out early next year and I still have maybe another 100-200 hours of games from the 1.5+2.5 collection to get through. The one upcoming release that I am seriously tempted by is Insomniac's PS4 Spider-Man game (no surprise there). Somehow when I was in college I had time to play lots of RPGs and stuff, but being a working guy really eats away at your gaming time. (That and I should probably be reading more, natch.)\r\n\r\n [1]: https://karigee.com/blog/2018/6/27/i-have-some-updates\r\n [2]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/49520/Borderlands_2/\r\n [3]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/20180707214302_1.jpg\r\n [4]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/489830/TheElderScrollsV_SkyrimSpecial_Edition/\r\n [5]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/20180527235423_1.jpg\r\n [6]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/49600/Beat_Hazard/\r\n [7]: https://roytang.net/2017/07/hardware-review-steam-link/\r\n [8]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/63000/HOARD/\r\n [9]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/531640/EternalCardGame/\r\n [10]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/20171025204940_1.jpg\r\n [11]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/310950/StreetFighterV/\r\n [12]: https://paydro.ph/\r\n [13]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/20180714145840_1.jpg\r\n [14]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/388750/BlazBlueChronophantasmaExtend/\r\n [15]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/702890/BlazBlueCrossTag_Battle/\r",

Here's the first one. Two is a series, right?)\r\n\r\nGreat comment the other day on reddit (found via r/bestof), in response to Twitter's inaction vs Alex Jones. Quoting part of the comment:\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\r\n  p\r\n    How can the OG generation of web users possibly hope to maintain the Internet as a free and decentralized medium when a growing majority emof the current userbase/em accept centralization of content and audience, as not only the status quo but as the way things emshould be/em? To such an extent that they make the perverse argument that YouTube shouldn't be able to ban people for inciting violence?\r\n  /p\r\n  \r\n  p\r\n    2007 (or possibly earlier) was the end of the personal Internet and the beginning of the corporate silo Internet. People from 1997 would be totally confused that everyone visits ONE SITE to participate in forum discussions. The 1997 way of doing things would be two hundred different forums for subject interests and if you wanted to find another one you would have to Ask Jeeves or use a web ring. People from 1997 would be emappalled/em that Reddit not only doesn't ban Stormfront, we let them run communities emunder our noses/em like redpill and the D (or gradually take them over, like tumblrinaction and cringepics). But the bitterness in our cup, we mixed for ourselves: this is the logical consequence of \"wouldn't it be great if all forums were just a click away from each other?\" Why have forums when you can have THE forum? And then let's put a corporation in charge of it, a corporation that's too much of a fucking pussy to actually take action against evil that's happening on their watch -- except sporadically, hypocritically and only when the media spotlight burns too bright.\r\n  /p\r\n  \r\n  p\r\n    So, sure, the Jones defenders are half right in that the modern internet is a corruption of the original Dream of the Web: far from a decentralized \"web\" of users, everything now is a natural monopoly, and the corporations rent the actual function of the Internet back to us, piecemeal. We are no longer a web, but a series of watering holes.\r\n  /p\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nI miss the decentralized internet of 2007 that the comment above alludes to. A few weeks ago I was cleaning up some old files and found a list of blogs I used to follow. Most of them are dead now, either unavailable or no updates in years. Probably the owners thought \"what's the point\" and started hanging out in one of the corporate silos instead. Some of them were people I knew IRL, while others were strangers I met or online or whose blogs I stumbled upon and found interesting enough to follow.\r\n\r\nSlight tangent 1: Hill I am willing to die on: a blog is a website with a series of posts, often reverse chronological nature. A blog post is a single post on a blog.\r\n\r\nUnderstandably, running and maintaining your own blog isn't for everybody; it's much easier to set up a Facebook page or a Twitter account or a subreddit and just post everything there, and that's fine. But what's disappointing is the lack of open interoperability between these channels that makes it difficult for smaller sites to operate independently of the large behemonths.\r\n\r\nSlight tangent 2: I miss RSS, I really wish it took off. I mean, fundamentally, sites like Facebook and Twitter aren't that much different from feedreaders of yore (Okay, I still use a feedreader, it's Feedly), except we'd probably need to expand the protocol to standardize on reply/commenting systems. \r\n\r\n4.5. If you want to give RSS a slight boost, there's a tool I found recently that lets you export URLs from your twitter follows to an OPML that you can import to an RSS reader. It's net!  \r\n\r\n\r\nWith Twitter's current Alex Jones problem and the recent troubles at Facebook, I've been looking into some interesting approaches to decentralized/federated social media. One that I found interesting is Mastodon. I currently have an account, @roytang@mastodon.social, not sure if I'll migrate to a different server at some point. It's much less toxic than Twitter, and I'm especially fond of their declared philosophy re: abuse and harassment. However, there isn't that much interesting content yet, at least as far as I can tell. If you know of someone interesting to follow on Mastodon, tell me about it!\r\n\r\n5.5. Andy Baio of waxy.org recently posted an interesting tweetstorm talking about how it was in the early days of Twitter and how Mastodon feels by comparison.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI run a personal blog with very few readers (I'm fine with that), and I use social media cross-posting to notify Twitter followers and Facebook friends when I have new posts. Or at least I used to, until Facebook recently pulled the plug on their APIs that now make it impossible to autopost from Twitter. I'm tempted to stop crossposting altogether lol. (At the very least I know there's at least one person that reads my blog without me posting the link to Facebook, so that's nice.)\r\n\r\nThere's a kind of relevant Oatmeal comic about this here. (Not that I produce anywhere near as good content as Oatmeal does but w/e)\r\n\r\nAll hope is not lost though, there are still people out there blogging tirelessly. A while back I found quite a few interesting blogs from a Kottke post. One of the ones I like best is karigee.com, and she puts it quite well as to why she still blogs (this quote also conveniently quoted in the same Kottke post above):\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\r\n  p\r\n    I also keep it out of spite, because I refuse to let social media take everything. Those shapeless, formless platforms haven't earned it and don't deserve it. I've blogged about this many times, but I still believe it: When I log into Facebook, I see Facebook. When I visit your blog, I see you.\r\n  /p\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nI think it's highly unlikely that we get anything close to the decentralized internet back. The internet trend of megacorps and centralization and consolidation is reflective of real-life trends after all (capitalism and economics of scale and mass consumerism and all that seem to point in this direction.) But that doesn't mean we can't keep writing our blogs.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://roytang.net/2017/06/blogging-and-social-media/\r\n [2]: https://np.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/96ug3n/vimeojustdecidedtoremovecontentfrom/e43gtq8/?context=1\r\n [3]: https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/9/17669144/twitter-alex-jones-jack-dorsey-del-harvey\r\n [4]: https://feedly.com/\r\n [5]: https://opml.glitch.me/\r\n [6]: https://joinmastodon.org/\r\n [7]: https://mastodon.social/@roytang\r\n [8]: https://blog.joinmastodon.org/2018/07/cage-the-mastodon/\r\n [9]: https://waxy.org/\r\n [10]: https://twitter.com/waxpancake/status/1027793032676962305\r\n [11]: http://theoatmeal.com/comics/reaching_people\r\n [12]: https://mailchi.mp/kottke/blogging-is-not-dead-edition-2575912502\r",

Pitkin\r\n  /p\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nIt's supposed to be a milestone of some kind, isn't it? Like any other birthday though, I don't feel much different. I still feel like a kid (hence the \"kid-at-heart\" in this blog's header), no more an adult than I was twenty years ago. More or less still the same person. I still enjoy the same pursuits, prefer the same foods, have the same hobbies, appreciate the same things. I would like to believe that despite the harshness of the world I still remain mostly an idealist. That in the face of chaos I remain stoic and committed to reason. That I can still step forward into the world with faith in humanity. (Though the past few years have been challenging to say the least.)\r\n\r\nNot everything is the same of course. What is humanity if not change? Perhaps a little bit wiser, maybe a bit more battle-scarred, almost certainly a tiny bit less optimistic and a tiny bit more cynical. Knees a little bit more wobbly. A tiny bit more forgetful. Traveled more of the world. Learned more about people. Maybe even understood them a little bit more. Hoped, dreamed, disappointed, challenged, failed, got back up again, got hurt, hurt people back, achieved victory, suffered defeat. Seen more, lived more.   \r\n\r\n\r\nI still hold a lot of the aspirations I had when I was young. When you are young, you tend to dream ambitiously. This is the benefit of youth, your world is yet unbounded by harsh realities, you are invincible and everything is within your reach. These days, I think I still hold to the same hopes and dreams, but I have a better acceptance of what their probabilities are. And right now I'm at a stage of life where my priority is mainly to enjoy life and not to stress myself too much. Do things that I want. Work on projects that make me feel alive. Sleep in on rainy mornings. Read good stories. Enjoy the company of family and loved ones and friends.\r\n\r\nLife and age and time, they come and go. This is supposed to be some kind of midpoint isn't it? But who knows how much time we really have in this world? (Or how much time this world has at all?) Life and age and time, they creep on you slowly, in an almost unnoticeable manner. Days and months and years pass by quickly and fade to memory. All the more for us to cherish each moment as it comes and it passes. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to the next forty.",

The most common scenario is when someone messages you like \"Hey, can we talk later?\" with no additional context whatsoever. Depending on your relationship with that person, you might start to overthink things. \"Am I in trouble? Did something go wrong? What did I tell her last time? Did I forget to submit something?\" And so on. Relevant tweet:figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter\"\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 888463047857197056 }}\r\n\r\nWhich is nonsense of course. Without any additional context, there is an equal likelihood the discussion would end up being about something positive or neutral, instead of something negative. Anxiety is caused mostly by fear and uncertainty, magnified by a time gap. That time gap is filled by a hyperactive imagination with worst-case scenarios.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I'm a well-adjusted adult, so I rarely let this sort of anxiety affect me, although I know I am more vulnerable to it when I am stressed by other factors. For me, the key to avoiding this problem is to practice some level of detachment (something I need to improve at as well), and also to keep oneself busy, to prevent the hyperactive mind from going into overdrive.\r\n\r",

It's a fantastic read for anyone who grew up playing PC games during the 80s and 90s. It gives us a birds-eye view of what the burgeoning gaming industry was like back then, not just with the technical and business aspects, but a lot of the human aspects as well: there's plenty of drama, conflict, and betrayal to go around.\r\n\r\nThe book's narrative does a good job of contrasting the Two Johns: Carmack was a programmer, a technical wizard who pushed the boundaries of game programming where no one else dared go. He was interested purely in the programming and in the creation of virtual worlds and preferred a smaller, leaner, ruthlessly efficient company focused on making the most of his technology. Romero was a gamer first, and an ambitious and competitive one. He was the number one competitor on their own deathmatch games and dreamt of building a gaming empire, living the life of a rock start among the gaming community as the front man of id software. Together their complimentary skill set would take them through a dizzying rise to fame and fortune in the game development world as they blazed new trails, defined new genres, and inspired a new generation of competitors. At the same time, their differences would ultimately cause them to go down different paths -- knowing full well in advance how the story ended for their partnership made me turn the pages quicker as I dreaded the inevitable split.\r\n\r\nI was a gamer since the late eighties, and though I never considered myself particularly good at first-person shooters, I did play most of the games that comprised id software's wonder years -- Wolfenstein 3D, Doom, Doom II, Quake and Quake II. I will freely confess I mostly used the build-in cheat codes to just fool around in most of these games, although I'm pretty sure I finished Quake II's single-player campaign legitimately. We didn't have good internet back then, so the only opportunity I ever had to play Deathmatch back then was split-screen on a console at a friend's house, even then it was helluva fun. Post-Quake II, I never played FPSes much again, though I did enjoy reading about John Romero and Ion Storm and was looking forward to their promised RPG Anachronox and only later heard about what a failure Daikatana turned out to be.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI still have this lingering dream of breaking into game development somehow. Though I'm not envious of the death march crunch mode periods typically described in the book, I am a bit envious of what a huge advantage it was for geniuses like Carnack and Romero to have been at the right place and time for the nascent games industry to turn them into legends. I don't know if I'd have had the technical chops to compete with them if I had the same opportunities, but I surely would have given it a go. I consider myself closer in temperament to Carnack than Romero -- I'm more interested in the technical side and could probably use some help in the promotion and game design and level design stuff. I don't know if I'll ever actually get there, but I take solace in this quote from the penultimate chapter of the book:\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\r\n  p\r\n    Carmack disdained talk of highfalutin things like legacies but when pressed would allow at least one thought on his own. \"In the information age, the barriers just aren’t there,\" he said. \"The barriers are self-imposed. If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you don’t need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on, and the dedication to go through with it. We slept on floors. We waded across rivers.\" br /\r\n  /p\r\n/blockquote",

A while back I wrote a review for Tim Ferris' book Tribe of Mentors on this blog, and for some reason someone decided to contact me citing this review and asked if I would review this other book and they would give me a complimentary copy. This was something new to me, so I thought I'd try it out! (I guess this a thing I do know. Feel free to send me books on random topics to review!)\r\n\r\nLink to the book on Amazon.\r\n\r\nAnyway, on to the book: It's relatively short, it only took me a while to get through it because of general busy-ness. Coming from someone who doesn't have much experience in marketing and sales, I think the book gives a decent overview of this space. I have some prior informal knowledge of many of these concepts, but it's nice to have a more structured idea of how the general flow of marketing works. \r\n\r\nI find a lot of modern marketing techniques distasteful. I'm not especially fond of people aggressively push-marketing to me via cold calls or pushing flyers in my face. To the book's credit, it points out that such blind-shotgun techniques are wildly ineffective. And while it doesn't go into too much detail about each particular area, I think having a more solid understanding of modern marketing techniques and mentalities will help me \"understand the enemy\" better, so to speak.\r\n\r\nAs to the 1-page marketing plan itself: I don't have enough marketing knowledge to say whether it's really an innovation in implementation as the author claims, but it seems like a reasonable checklist for a business to consider when planning out their marketing activities. If I ever manage to talk myself into starting a business, the overview given by this book would certainly be useful. The book itself isn't very expensive, so I think it's a reasonable buy for someone new to the marketing space.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://roytang.net/2018/06/book-review-tribe-of-mentors-by-tim-ferris/\r",

Capitalism mirrored the law of nature: the strong will survive.\r\n\r\nThese days, I am much less enamored with the idea of capitalism. Not that I disbelieve that it makes us more efficient, but that ruthless efficiency has a cost. Like the law of nature that it mirrors, capitalism ensures that the strong survive, but the corollary is also true: the weak will die and be consumed by the strong. Humans are a societal species, which means we are supposed to be stronger together. But capitalism, optimized towards the pursuit of profit, often times can force us to sacrifice the greater good in favor of individual interests. Corporations especially, will often act as soulless entities whose mandate is above all to pursue profits in the name of the stockholders.\r\n\r\nMany of the societal ills in the world today can be directly traced to the ruthless efficiency in pursuit of profit, the prime example being environmental issues like climate change and pollution: governments don't want to enact stronger controls because it will cut into corporations' bottom lines, and politicians don't want to piss off corporations that they rely on for donations. Capitalism's ruthless efficiency has brought us to a world of wage inequality, banks too large to fail, and large monolithic companies that are virtual monopolies due to network effect. It's a system that reinforces the rich and powerful (the strong survive) while the masses suffer in silence (the weak will die)\r\n\r\nThe emergence of large monolithic corporations wielding monopoly powers is especially challenging, and is a natural consequence of \"the strong survive\". As the rich get richer, they can use the accumulated power and money to defeat any further competition that dares to challenge them. Thus they are able to resist becoming more efficient in favor of simply using their leadership status as a blunt instrument. You can see this in the tech industry with virtual monopolies such as Google (search), Facebook (social networking), Amazon (sales, cloud hosting); realistically they can only be challenged by companies of similar scale, there is no space for smaller guys to move into.  \r\n\r\nI still think capitalism can be a force for good, and that efficiency is still something to strive for. But I also now believe that this efficiency should be tempered by a corresponding collectivism, whether enforced by states&nbsp; (through regulation or subsidies or welfare programs) or by some other mechanism. The idea of something like universal basic income is promising, but under a purely free market system, I don't see how it could work. It is hopefully not too late for us to find a way to navigate our society to a post-scarcity Star Trek-like future, where humans are able to dedicate themselves to scientific and artistic pursuits without worrying about survival.\r\n\r\n(If this sounds like a rant with no proposed answers, it is. This post and others like are just me sounding off on how my thinking and philosophical leanings have changed throughout the years, so that I may consider where it can lead me to. Feel free to debate me in the comments.)",

I'm talking about software projects/systems, but there are a lot of parallels with societal systems too, like governments or states.\r\n\r\nI've been in large projects with hundreds of thousands of LOC where a lot of the code was painful to read and full of code smells and so on. It happens over time as projects get maintained by different developers and teams or different enhancements or changes are made. It becomes more difficult/costly for new developers to work on the project as things are brittle and may easily fall apart.\r\n\r\nI've also had the dubious pleasure of living under a system of government heavily burdened by corruption and inefficiency and patronage and nepotism and inequality and a bunch of other problems.\r\n\r\nYou Will Be Tempted To Throw Everything Out And Start Over\r\n\r\nIn such situations, you will often find yourself fed up. You will be tempted to throw everything away and start over and rebuild everything from scratch. You wonder who made all of these past decisions that have resulted in such a terrible system and what the heck were they thinking?\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, you can't just throw everything away. People still need to eat, and the system users still need to do their work. You can instead do some kind of system-wide one-time big-time change. But the problem with that is... \r\n\r\nChange Is Risk\r\n\r\nMore often than not, the existing system works. Or at least, it works well enough that the system isn't totally unusable. The software system's users can still perform the needed functions, albeit maybe with some number of bugs. The state's citizens can still mostly survive and there aren't riots on the streets or people dying of mass starvation or anything like that. Life is hard, but there is life.\r\n\r\nLooking to change things means some level of risk, and of course some level of cost. There are several possible outcomes:\r\n\r\n  Change happens and things become better. Hooray! The change was worth it!\r\n  Change happens but things remain the same. Uhh, why did we spend all that time and effort for the change then?\r\n  Change happens but things actually get worse. This is the worst of all worlds. We wasted time and money and energy and things got worse! Why didn't anyone warn us this could happen!\r\n\r\nOften we can't predict with any certainty which outcome will happen. We can make educated guesses, by comparing to past experiences or other people's experiences. But each software project is unique.&nbsp;This is kind of a blessing since it means it's hard for programmers to run out of work. But it's also more of a curse since it means we can only reuse small parts from other projects with no guarantee that the entire whole will work cohesively together.\r\n\r\nCountries/states/governments are unique too. Each people has their own geography, culture and history and unique problems arising from such. And to make matters worse, countries are made up of people, and most people will have differing opinions on which things are better and which things are worse. This makes it much more difficult to form a consensus.\r\n\r\nRisk Management\r\n\r\n**Granted that change is risk. But sometimes we have to take those risks anyway. We have to decide whether the risk is worth the possible upside vs the potential downside.",

I found the code lying around while I was going through some backups lately. It's way out of date, it uses an early version of django. I thought of bringing it up to speed, but that didn't seem practical. Instead, for archival purposes, I cleaned it up a bit and uploaded the code to a github repo. (Helpful github immediately warned me that having a very old version of Django was a security risk lol). There's a lot more information in the README.md of that repo. I actually used this as my main blog engine for a while before I decided the maintenance effort wasn't worth it and switched to WordPress.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTangent: I'm not actually 100% happy with WordPress, and when I found this old code I was tempted to maybe trying building Yet Another Blog Application (TM), except maybe using the opportunity to learn some other framework. My 2018 personal to-do list is already way too long though.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://www.djangoproject.com/\r",

Modern systems, Perrow argues, are made up of thousands of parts, all of which interrelate in ways that are impossible to anticipate. Given that complexity, he says, it is almost inevitable that some combinations of minor failures will eventually amount to something catastrophic.\r\n\r\nThe description of \"modern systems\" above reminds me most of modern software systems. And it is true that modern software systems are made of thousands of \"parts\", and the way they all interrelate with each other can be impossible to anticipate. This is why software defects are inevitable, especially as system size grows. Once a software system is large enough, there will be no single developer who can see all the details of every operation the software does. While we try to maximize testing scope, we cannot possibly handle every possible combination of thousands of inputs, and we limit ourselves to the most likely cases. This is considered an acceptable risk of software development.\r\n\r\nWhile your critical software bug is not likely to cost millions of dollars to clean up, a lot of what Gladwell discusses in the article can still be applicable to software development.\r\n\r\nIf software systems can be compared to normal accidents, what else does Gladwell's article say about such accidents that might be applicable to software systems? Later on Gladwell tells us about risk homeostasis:\r\n\r\n There is another way to look at this problem, and that is from the standpoint of how human beings handle risk. One of the assumptions behind the modern disaster ritual is that when a risk can be identified and eliminated a system can be made safer. The new booster joints on the shuttle, for example, are so much better than the old ones that the over-all chances of a Challenger-style accident’s ever happening again must be lower-right? This is such a straightforward idea that questioning it seems almost impossible. But that is just what another group of scholars has done, under what is called the theory of \"risk homeostasis.\" It should be said that within the academic community there are huge debates over how widely the theory of risk homeostasis can and should be applied. But the basic idea, which has been laid out brilliantly by the Canadian psychologist Gerald Wilde in his book \"Target Risk,\" is quite simple: under certain circumstances, changes that appear to make a system or an organization safer in fact don’t. Why? Because human beings have a seemingly fundamental tendency to compensate for lower risks in one area by taking greater risks in another.\r\n\r\nRisk management is a big part of software development, especially as projects grow larger. We need to be careful that we are evaluating the collective risks on a project accurately and not just trading one set of risks for another.\r\n\r",

The combat system is basically Pokemon. So yes, it's Ghibli+Pokemon. Pokemon in this game are called \"familiars\" and each party member can have up to 3 familiars ready to fight in battle. The party members can fight directly as well, but most of the time it's a better idea to let your familiars go at it. \r\n\r\nAs you can imagine, the grindiest part of the post-game was collecting all the familiars. Ok, not all of them, the achievement only required 250 different species captured, but that's a helluva lot. During the normal main game run, I only captured a bit less than 100 different species. It was made more grindy by the fact that there's no mechanism for trying to capture the familiars (i.e. pokeballs), you basically just have to beat them in battle and whenever you beat one, there's like a 2-8% chance that you will get an opportunity to recruit it. Thankfully, you can shortcut the grind a bit by collecting the lower level ones and using metamorphoses (basically pokemon evolutions) to get the higher level ones.\r\n\r\nThe story feels like it's targeted towards children, so it has a kind of fairy tale feel, and the world is very bright and cheerful (mostly) and there's things like a kingdom where the king is a giant cat, and so on. Not that the plot is simple mind you -- there's quite a bit or parallel worlds, a tiny bit of time travel, and a few plot twists thrown in (although you might have seen them coming).\r\n\r\nMy favorite part of the game has to be all the puns. Many of the familiars have some sort of pun involved in their name, like there's a dog familiar called \"Ruffian\"; there's an egg-shaped familiar with a pharoah mask called \"Eggyptian\". There's a cat thief familiar called \"Purrloiner\", who evolves into a \"Cutpurrse\", and can then evolve into another form which you can fight on the seas called a \"Puss in Boats\". There's a sheep familiar called \"Baatender\" who can evolve into a \"Baabarian\". There's a familiar that wears a turban and he's called a \"Turbandit\", and he has higher forms called \"Turban Myth\" and \"Turban Legend\". Okay, I'll stop before I enumerate them all. \r\n\r\nThere's a few other systems familiar to JRPG players -- crafting, a casino, farming enemies for drops, bounty hunts, errand boards and so on on. Oh and some nonsense about fixing people's hearts by finding people willing to contribute attributes like confidence and kindness and whatnot.\r\n\r\nAll in all a very fun game and something I'm glad to have gotten off my backlog! Not sure if I'll have time to play the second game though, maybe in another five years?  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n__",

But I do recognize that I have this problem of emotional attachment to a project, especially if I'm the main person responsible for it. When working on anything you of course need a certain amount of drive or passion that commits you to the project and pushes you to do the best work you can, but there's a line you can cross where it becomes unhealthy for you. It's when the project and the stress that comes with it starts to take over your life, such that it starts eating up your personal time and you can't get it out of your mind and maybe you even start having nightmares about it. \r\n\r\nThe key to realize this is happening and take a step back and think about whether you need to let go of things for a while. Maybe take some time off even. Learn to compartmentalize and set aside work when you leave the office. Emotional detachment is a skill I still have to learn and master, but it's essential. Otherwise (as the quoted zen proverb states), you get dragged. That means the stress starts to cascade through your personal life and your health and that can't be good for you. As the HN thread notes, work is not the end-all and be-all of life, and on your deathbed you won't wish you had worked more.\r\n\r\n\"But how can I possibly scale back my involvement, there's so much stuff to do!\". Delegate. Ask for help. Ask to adjust the schedule. Trust your team to get things done. Find a better approach. Regardless, you shouldn't sacrifice your well-being for the sake of work. As the airline safety videos tell you, you have to take care of your own oxygen mask before taking care of others!  \r\n\r\n\r\nI actually find this to be a problem with me with personal matters as well, not just with work. I tend to get attached to particular problems or issues and won't give it a rest until I've somehow managed to resolve the issue. Most of the time this isn't a big problem (I rarely have big personal issues), but some time ago a close friend and I drifted apart because I was insisting that she should follow my advice. I don't regret giving my advice -- I still think I was right -- but I do regret pushing so hard for it, it was her life to live, not mine. (This particular situation led to the creation of one of my personal rules: Don't insist on helping people who don't want to be helped.)  \r\n\r\n\r\nA small side note: I binged seasons 3-7 of Parks and Recreation lately (seasons 1-2 weren't very good sadly). While I've always considered myself most similar to the characters of Ron (loves breakfast food, hates government inefficiency, prefers substance over form) and Ben (nerdy, loves pop culture and boardgames and Batman), I realized after this rewatch that I also embody one of the character Leslie's worst traits. And that trait is the inability to detach from her work and even her personal problems. She gets a certain tunnel vision when she's focused on a particular issue and tenaciously never lets go of it. Granted, she does get a lot of stuff done over the course of the series, but more than once the other characters have had to point out how her overzealousness creates problems.\r\n\r\nSo yes, letting go. I don't consider myself super religious, but there's a prayer I like, called the serenity prayer, that I think kind of embodies the kind of personal detachment I want to strive for:  \r\n\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\r\n  p\r\n    God, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,br /Courage to change the things I can,br /And wisdom to know the difference.\r\n  /p\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r",

This usually involves reviewing other people's code, helping them with tough technical issues, and even giving career advice. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how good I am when it comes to mentoring other software developers. When I first became technical lead on projects, I got some evaluations from junior developers saying I can be \"intimidating\". I think it comes from the fact that I have a natural tendency towards being snarky and being annoyed at bad code. It's something I'm trying to improve, and while I'll never be cuddly, I think I've made some great strides in being approachable and in advice-giving. I do try to be accommodating and I'm always willing to help anyone who asks for it.\r\n\r\nTo that end, a while back I tweeted the following (it's currently my pinned tweet):figure class=\"wp-block-embed-twitter wp-block-embed\"\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 905431727681572865 }}\r\n\r\n(Side note: If you're working in tech and interested in business stuff, Stephanie Hurlburt is a good follow on Twitter)\r\n\r\nIt was a bit scary putting myself out there in this way -- impostor syndrome kicked in big time. What if people ask me questions I'm not good enough to answer? What if I give terrible advice? Even worse, what if I give \\wrong\\ advice?!? Still, it seemed worth a shot.\r\n\r\nI wasn't actually expecting to get many questions, since I didn't have too many followers on Twitter. But the above tweet got me put on at least 2 twitter mentor lists (https://ishansharma.github.io/twitter-mentors/ and https://mentorlist.herokuapp.com), so I did end up getting a few. Here are some samples of the discussions I ended up having:\r\n\r\n  A C/Java developer with 2 years experience looking for advice on how to write good code. I ended up recommending some books to read\r\n  A student looking for some help with a group assignment involving JSP and Servlets -- he wasn't too well-versed with the technology yet or web programming in general, and I ended up having to explain some of the more basic concepts (apparently their teacher wasn't doing a very good job)\r\n  A Java developer with 7 years experience looking for advice on how to keep up with advancing technologies and how to interview for senior positions\r\n  A developer asking for feedback on a technical blog post he wrote \r\n  A developer asking for feedback on a small project she had uploaded to Github\r\n\r\nAll of the responses so far have been from internet strangers -- not sure if it's because most of the devs I know IRL aren't on Twitter. Well, that and any devs I know IRL who want advice have better channels to contact me by. \r\n\r\nIt has been an interesting experience. So far everyone seems to have been receptive to my advice and my impostor syndrome concerns haven't been realised (maybe they've just being polite lol). I'm also not sure if I should follow-up with them after some time to see how things worked out or if that's weird. I'm looking forward to more queries in the future.",

He's funny and well-written and basically just a big bag of human flaws that somehow bumbles his way into managing an office. He's self-centered, attention-hungry, easily distracted, and refuses to acknowledge any bad news, yet despite all of that he loves his workmates like a family.  \r\nfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\r\n\r\nimg src=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/980x1.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2852\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/980x1.png 748w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/980x1-269x300.png 269w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/980x1-600x669.png 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px\" //figure \r\n\r\nThe thing I find most relatable is his complete self-confidence that he can be good at everything. Not just his job as a manager and as a salesman, but everything he chooses to do. As an example, he auditioned for a play (The Demon Barber of Fleet Street) and automatically assumed he was getting a part. He also made a movie which fell into the so-bad-its-good category (Threat Level Midnight) and was pissed off that his girlfriend didn't care much for it. He also claims to have written a business book and an HBO comedy special.\r\n\r\nI find the above relatable because I have this similar flaw of wanting to do everything and yet feel bad when I fall short. Like Michael Scott, I often don't have the patience for grinding through the beginner stages of some new thing I'm trying out -- it's something I'm working on improving. I'm sure both Michael Scott and I could stand to learn from Adventure Time&#8216;s Finn the Dog:  \r\n\r\n\r\ndiv class=\"wp-block-image\"\r\n  figure class=\"aligncenter\"img src=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/6dc1.gif\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2854\" //figure\r\n/div",

The rest of the list took a lot more thinking. Back to the Future (and the rest of the trilogy, really it's hard to take them separately) is undoubtedly my favorite movie of all time. (And unquestionably the best time travel of all time, fight me!) There is not much to say: it came out when I was growing up and instilled with me a great love for time travel stories of all kinds.

My earliest memory of these movies was watching A New Hope via betamax at my ninong's house during one of our visits there when I was a child.  ANH is my choice here, but Empire and Jedi hold up really well for me as well.  \r\n\r\n\r\n3.

Zoolander is one of them. For some reason, me and a group of work friends latched onto the movie and kept quoting it in our internal chats for ridiculous reasons. The movie isn't of the best quality, but it's hilarious and we still randomly say Merman!! when we see each other. (The sequel did not make any particular impression on our group.)\r\n\r\nToy Soldiersfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\r\n\r\nimg src=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36606393101567500513189122937498257388994560n1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2739\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36606393101567500513189122937498257388994560n1.jpg 624w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36606393101567500513189122937498257388994560n1-195x300.jpg 195w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36606393101567500513189122937498257388994560n1-600x923.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 624px) 100vw, 624px\" //figure \r\n\r\nThis is one of those weird instances where I can't tell why I like this movie so much. I've never seen it in the theatres or TV nor do I have any digital copy, but I do believe we had a betamax copy of it back in the day and that me and my brother watched it several times. I have fond memories of this movie and being especially excited at the sequence where they use the flying drone thing to create a distraction while one of the kids sneaks out avoiding the hostage takers in order to communicate information to law enforcement, and he has to sneak back in in time for roll call, which he misses and he has to pretend he was in the shower all along. Actually, that's mainly the only part of the movie that I can clearly remember.\r\n\r\nGroundhog Dayfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\r\n\r\nimg src=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36849180101567588864289128944807849674932224n1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2740\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36849180101567588864289128944807849674932224n1.jpg 644w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36849180101567588864289128944807849674932224n1-201x300.jpg 201w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36849180101567588864289128944807849674932224n1-600x894.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px\" //figure \r\n\r\nIt's a bit strange for me to have a kind of a sappy romance movie on this list, but it's also an awesome time loop movie that I've seen many, many times. I thought about putting Ghostbusters on this list as the representative Bill Murray movie, and it was close but Groundhog Day won out, probably because I really really like stories that mess with the flow of time.\r\n\r\nCaptain America: Winter Soldierfigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\r\n\r\nimg src=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36825371101567618145989125429857823523602432n1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2741\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36825371101567618145989125429857823523602432n1.jpg 648w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36825371101567618145989125429857823523602432n1-203x300.jpg 203w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36825371101567618145989125429857823523602432n1-600x889.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 648px) 100vw, 648px\" //figure \r\n\r\nI've greatly enjoyed the MCU over the past ten years, so I'm pretty sure it deserved at least one slot on this list. I waffled on choosing Winter Soldier _and _Guardians of the Galaxy for this, but while the space adventure was fun, I chose the Captain America one because of the timely themes of government surveillance and the government being controlled by evil Nazis and well-meaning civil servants having to defy orders to save the day.\r\n\r\nStreet Fighter the Moviefigure class=\"wp-block-image\"\r\n\r\nimg src=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36866236101567635245339127213879159724965888n1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2742\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36866236101567635245339127213879159724965888n1.jpg 686w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36866236101567635245339127213879159724965888n1-214x300.jpg 214w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/36866236101567635245339127213879159724965888n1-600x840.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 686px) 100vw, 686px\" //figure \r\n\r\nLike Zoolander was the cult classic for my work friends, Street Fighter The Movie is the so-bad-its-good cult classic for me and my high school friends.

It's too bad no one ever thought about making a series of live-action movies in this franchise.\r\n\r\nWhen I started this list I had trouble getting beyond the first item, but after having thought about it a while, there's a lot of other movies I'd have liked to be able to fit in this list. _Ghostbusters, Die Hard, the Indiana Jones trilogy, Con Air, Shawshank Redemption, Inception, Infinity War, The Lord of the Rings trilogy, _and that's just off the top of my head. \r\n\r\nThanks for reading!

I only know John Krasinski from The Office, \r\n\r\nSpoilers for Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan: \r\n\r\n{{% spoiler %}}\r\nThe story starts with Ryan tracking down Suleiman's network via financials, but they never follow-up on who was financing his group\r\nI'm not sure what was the point of the whole drone pilot side story (including the weird trip to the casino and the night with the couple), although it was admittedly kind of entertaining\r\n{{% /spoiler %}}\r\n\r\n\r\nDaredevil season 3 (on Netflix) -- I enjoyed the season a lot. I posted a spoiler-free review over on the ireadcomicbooks tumblr. Over here I can post spoilers. \r\n\r\n{{% spoiler %}}\r\nI wasn't familiar with Murdock's parentage from the comics, so the Maggie reveal came as a surprise to me. A+\r\nSad that there was no Bullseye namedrop.\r\nThe ending kind of flubbed it a bit, could have used an explanation of at what point Matt decided not to kill Fisk. It's not clear if it was something he decided on the spot or if the compromise was part of a plan he devised after interrogating Manning.\r\n{{% /spoiler %}}\r\n\r\n\r\nVenom -- I initially wasn't planning on watching this given the terrible early reviews, but eventually I was like, hey I watched X-Men Apocalypse so might as well watch this too. It turned out not so bad (low expectations helped), although I find the movie's enhancements to the symbiote abilities a bit disconcerting. Read my spoiler-free review here.\r\n\r\nBatman Ninja -- I found out this was on Netflix and went ahead and watched it. The animations and character designs are nice, but the plot is just ridiculous lol. Feels like someone wrote a Batman fanfic.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://ireadcomicbooks.tumblr.com/post/179331448050/daredevil-season-3-spoiler-free-review\r\n [2]: https://ireadcomicbooks.tumblr.com/post/179008685600/venom-spoiler-free-review\r",

Our wager was worth one cubic meter of solid gold.br /br /A few years back, I made a wager with an officemate who was about to leave my company to go independent; I bet that I would become famous before he would. To win the bet, one would have to be named person of the year by a major international publication such as Time or Newsweek.br /br /I'm still a dreamer, I always have been. Since I was young I've dreamed of accomplishing something great. br /br /I think everybody has a dreamer inside them, especially when they're young. But as we grow older and face the different trials and tribulations of life, they start to chip away slowly at our dreams. Everyday we make some simple decision that trades a part of those dreams for something pragmatic. br /br /We tell ourselves we'd just be working for a year or so, until we figure out what direction I wanted my life to take. We have so many options in this day and age; never has the barrier for entry into freelancing, entrepreneurship or innovation been so low. One year passes, then another and then yet another. But we still don't know where we want to go.br /br /We say to ourselves; it's okay, I can work on my dreams in my spare time. I'll write a chapter a day. I'll code a few portions of my revolutionary web service after I get home. I'll do design work on my game on weekends. I'll brainstorm business ideas on the way to work. But when we come home from our daily grind, we're dead tired and just want to relax, or surf the web, or play games on our consoles. emI'll start tomorrow/em, a familiar mantra. And days turn into weeks and turn into months and into years.br /br /emI need to get some experience first. I just need to save up some more money. I'm already doing pretty well, why ruin it? I'm pretty lucky to have a well-paying job in this economy, I'd be foolish to take risks now. I don't think I can maintain my lifestyle without my job. /embr /br /These are the lies we tell ourselves when we find ourselves wondering what happened to our dreams, when we wake up to find ourselves trapped in the loop of ordinary life.br /br /In the end, we tell ourselves more lies. emI could've been great. I never had any opportunities. If only I had gotten a break. /embr /br /And we end our days, humble and simple, having lived an ordinary life. Just another statistic in human history, just another cog in the great wheel of destiny. br /br /For some people, this ordinary life may be enough, and that's great for them. They will live out their ordinary lives with their ordinary ending and grow old and raise their kids and enjoy the company of their grandchildren and they'll be completely happy and satisfied with that.br /br /That isn't my story. I don't want that to be my story. I'm greedy, I want more out of life. I don't want my dreams to die.\r\n  /p\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nWhile I think I more or less still agree with the sentiment expressed above and recognize it within myself, I think the past six years have also added to my perspective in certain ways. \r\n\r\nFor one thing, at one point in the intervening years I suffered what I consider to be true burnout (I will write about it in more detail someday). That experience created a part of me that's just weary of the world in general and just wants to rest and chill and enjoy life.   \r\n\r\n\r\nHaving worked in a startup recently, I can see how much hard work it takes to try to reach for your dreams and build something for yourself. After having experienced burnout, I am not sure I am willing to put myself through the same level of stress I used to tolerate in the past, much less the additional stress involved with managing my own business.\r\n\r\nFor sure part of me still has that same ambition and fire from six years ago, that still hopes I'll be able to figure out something clever and build something great and make a name for myself. But now there's another part too, and that part just tells me that I've already worked hard enough, that I don't need to prove anything to anyone, that I've earned a break.\r\n\r\nI know that this isn't an option for anyone and I realize that I am quite privileged financially -- having significant savings contributes to the fact that I can even consider taking a rest. \r\n\r\nBut this isn't about financial security. This is more about two conflicting philosophies. The first is that you should work hard to get the most out of life (ambition). The second is that happiness should not be dependent on success (contentment). Ambition pushes us to keep reaching for ever-increasing heights; but too much ambition means we may never find contentment since we keep searching for something greater beyond the horizon. It's a kind of delicate balance we need to walk. We need the fire of ambition to keep us moving forward, but we also need the wisdom of contentment to appreciate where we currently are.",

As such, I have a list of suggested additions to the High School curriculum here in the Philippines. (The first version of this list was in an FB post I wrote during the 2016 campaign period, in response to people clamoring for better Martial Law education. I have since made additions and added some notes. )  \r\n\r\n\r\n  planninbasic logic and reasoning\r\n  different types of fallacies\r\n  how to do basic research\r\n  critical analysis of history -- not just the rote memorization of dates and names common in most schools, but the students should be encouraged to analyze why things happened the way they did\r\n  how to judge whether something is likely to be true -- not sure if this is possible, humans are quite bad at making judgements\r\n  how to judge whether a source is reliable\r\n  how to to identify satire and/or sarcasm\r\n  basic concepts of statistics\r\n  how to articulate your arguments well (I think the Eng/Fil subject in HS curriculum covers only literature and not any sort of communication skill)\r\n  how to debate and argue without taking things personally\r\n  planning, decision making and time management\r\n  basic concepts of economics (including how taxes work, inflation, GDP, mortgages, loans, etc -- we had an economics subject in 4th year HS, but I don't know if that's standard and it was mostly theory and not on day-to-day applications)\r\n  basic concepts of investments and financial advice\r\n  ethics\r\n  proper usage of memes\r\n  when it is appropriate to post spoilers\r\n\r\nObviously, the challenge here is that many of these topics are easily \"testable\", i.e. it means the teacher will have to work harder with individual students to make sure they are understanding the concepts. If we turn these topics into simply rote memorization classes, then they would be useless anyway. \r\n\r\nI'm sure the lack of critical thinking/analysis and other life skills in education curricula isn't a problem unique to our country, but as a developing nation I think it's an important aspect that we can't afford to skimp on if we want to accelerate our development. The information age requires more than factory workers and rote memorization skills, it requires a well-educated citizenry with creativity and thinking out of the box.",

So it's not surprising that the derivative shows tend to lean the same way. Not only do many of the shows promote diversity, but many are becoming overtly political as well. Some recent examples. (Spoilers for current seasons of Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow and Daredevil follow)\r\n\r\n  The current season 4 of Supergirl seems to be focusing on anti-alien sentiment, a thinly-veiled allegory towards the anti-immigration movement propagated in far right \"nationalist\" circles. Similar to real-life, hatemongers are portrayed riling up crowds frustrated with losing jobs and threats to law and order due to the presence of \"aliens\".\r\n  The pilot episode of Legends of Tomorrow's season 4 includes a short segment where one of the characters visits her mother, a Muslim immigrant in the US, and wishes she could warn her to move to Canada before \"this country turns against her.\" Do the Legends know about things to come? (Of course, during the previous season, the showrunners admitted that the Muslim character in question was introduced precisely as a response to Trump's election.)\r\n  And finally, in the fantastic Daredevil season 3, Wilson's Fisk's being billeted in the \"Presidential Hotel\" and his calling out his supposed crimes as politically-motivated \"fake news\" reminds a lot of people of the current American president. If that wasn't enough, even the showrunner compares the Kingpin to Trump.\r\n\r\nThough it's not a completely new thing I'm glad the showrunners are willing to make their political opinions known. This, despite the existence the so-called ComicsGate movement among a minority of superhero fans, which is a self-described revolt against \"liberalism\". I wonder if these ComicsGate people also hate the TV shows?\r\n\r\n [1]: https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/aug/4/dcs-legends-of-tomorrow-producer-admits-muslim-cha/\r",

The PCSO 6/58 Ultra Lotto had gotten up to a record high jackpot prize of more than 1 billion PHP (roughly 20M USD -- I know some lotteries in the US have prizes way higher than that, but hey, we're not the US.) Many people who normally don't play the Lotto were participating due to the sheer size of the pot. I must confess that even I bought a few tickets during the latter part of the run. \r\n\r\nFor reference, the Ultra Lotto draw has 6 numbers from a pool of 1-58 (hence \"6/58\") drawn three times a week. Using the power of Math (TM), that gives us roughly 40 million possible combinations. By comparison, the Avengers only had a 1 in 14 million chance of surviving the events of Infinity War, so that's way worse odds and you don't even have a time stone! The price of an individual ticket is 24 PHP, and 24 * ~40 million is ~960 million, so once the jackpot exceeded 1 billion PHP, the EV of a single lotto ticket was already a net positive. If only I had the 960 million and change to bet on every single combination!\r\n\r\nI had actually started betting on the lotto sporadically since last year, mostly for fun. The first time you make a bet it's kind of exciting. Suddenly you went from zero chance of being instantly rich to a nonzero chance! A ridiculously small, highly unlikely chance, but still a chance!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nvia GIPHY\r\n\r\nOnce you've bet a few times though, the novelty kind of fades away after a while and you kinda feel silly, like you're paying a tax for not understanding the probabilities right. (To be fair, I totally did understand the probabilities, I just chose to hope! How can it be wrong to choose hope!)\r\n\r\nMy last bet was the Friday before the jackpot was actually won, and the jackpot was already past 1 billion at that time. To be honest, it caused me a little bit of anxiety. Obviously winning all that money would be good, but in the Philippines suddenly becoming rich had it's own share of risks, including security risks from less-than-honorable people finding out and targeting you for crimes. There was even a Reddit thread about it. (Yes, reading that thread didn't help with the anxiety.) Luckily (what?) I didn't end up winning.\r\n\r\nThe jackpot was eventually won last Sunday, Oct 14, split by two winners, bring the the dreams of a nation to an end. Almost immediately I read some conspiracy theories about how the whole thing was a setup and that the powers-that-be had purposely allowed the jackpot to get so high so more people would bet and then at the last minute they faked one of the winners so they could get the money and use it for the upcoming elections. Or something to that effect.\r\n\r\nI must say however, that I don't actually recommend regularly betting on the lotto. It's popular in this country, even when the jackpot isn't that high, I'm sure my dad has been regularly betting for decades now. Life is tough in this country and for many people the ridiculously low odds are about the same odds they face in daily life anyway so why not? But if you're going to play the lotto, don't delude yourself into thinking that you're actually going to win.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n [1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value\r\n [2]: https://giphy.com/gifs/jim-carrey-dumb-and-dumber-so-youre-telling-me-theres-a-chance-ToMjGpKniGqRNLGBrhu\r",

Quoting the relevant part:\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\r\n  p\r\n    br /Once you've done that, you have a population that's easier to manipulate. You have, say, 30% that's 100% sure on both ends, and probably another 15% on both ends that are 80% sure, and a remaining 10% that could go both ways. The more you do this, the more the 15% will be set in stone.br /Then, the fun begins with manipulating the 10%. You know where they live (through facebook), you know how they think (Cambridge Analytica), so you can target emthem/em, and only emthem/em. Not only can you target this particular group, but by knowing how the electoral system works, you can target only a few people, in a few swing states.\r\n  /p\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nThe US is already in this hyperpartisan state, as evidenced by how the GOP rhetoric often has them itching for civil war. This is kind of mirrored in the more extreme online views of some pro-admin people here in the PH, with admin propaganda minions demonizing anyone who opposes the president and some literally calling for opposition to be jailed or even killed. I don't think the PH has gotten as bad as the US in terms of hyperpartisanship though, mainly because (a) political parties in the Philippines are a joke; (b) Majority of Filipinos distrust politicians in general (hence the popular term \"trapo\" -- it's just that they still vote for them even knowing how they are); and (c) Filipino politicians\r\n\r\nI have a friend who has given up on being moderate or centrist, he says:\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\r\n  p\r\n    br /The past couple of years have taught me that politics really is like Game of Thrones. Moderation and compromise is weak. If you get complacent, if you let your foot off their throat, they'll destroy you, so you need to be willing to do all that dirty stuff right back.br /In the US the other side is racists, misogynists and rich old white ppl. In the Philippines the other side LITERALLY HAS DEATH SQUADS.br /Progressives can never let up on the gas. They can never stop and say \"this is enough,\" because if you do, the gains it took decades to work toward can be undone just like that.\r\n  /p\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nI'm sure he knows I disagree with this position -- I don't believe in fighting dirty (but I do believe in calling out those who do). I'm not advocating we adhere to the Spaceballs quote \"Evil will always triumph because good is dumb,\" but rather I would prefer people find a way to rise above this hyperpartisanship and find better ways to resolve differences. Somehow, there's still part of a \"Lawful Good\" idealist in me, despite the best efforts of this terrible world. Maybe this will be the death of me when fascists start trampling over the rest of us.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/9mcuy2/viralmanspreadingvideoisstaged_kremlin/e7e10n2/\r",

There was some kind of event going on in the main plaza for the Department of Agriculture; Secretary Pinol was there giving a speech. I walked a couple of rounds around the park so I could meet my daily steps target. The sun was coming down and I'm not the best photographer but I thought it looked good on the Quezon Memorial Shrine so I took the above shot.\r\n\r\nI have fond memories of the QCMC. When we were young our extended family used to have Saturday picnics there. We'd roll up this colorful rattan mat and get into our uncle's car and hang out there playing around and riding bikes and eating sandwiches. I also have this vague recollection of my dad bringing me up the tower that is the Quezon Memorial Shrine. (I don't know how that works. Are there stairs inside? Seems tiring to climb.) I don't think I've ever been in the museum at the base of the shrine though, I should try it some day.\r\n\r\nThese days I still pass by the QCMC every so often. (A single pass around the park adds a good 1500-2000 steps to my daily walks). There's a lot more stuff there now than when I was a kid -- there's playground sets for kids, some kind of exercise machines, there's now restaurants inside, and a whole lot of small vendor stalls. I remember a while back I saw like a zipline and some kind of small duck boat thing, not sure if they're still there, I don't recall seeing them during my last visit. There's a peace bell from the UN that was inaugurated in 1995. And a lot more weird statues than there used to be. (I regret not taking a picture of this weird gold statue I saw with three boys doing something I have no idea what.)  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe park doesn't feel super well-maintained; the asphalt roads have definitely seen better days. But somehow I still like it, there's this kind of homely atmosphere, and even on weekday afternoons there's a lot of people hanging out in the park. For me, the QCMC is more \"iconic\" than say, Rizal Park in Manila, maybe because I've lived in QC all my life.\r\n\r\nIn a few years, there will be an MRT station inside the Circle. I hope it leads to more economic activity in the park in general and doesn't lead to any sort of degradation. I hope to be visiting the park for years and decades to come.",

Circa 2001-2004ish. A time of Geocities and AIM and and ICQ and from before Gmail even launched.\r\n\r\nAt that time, I was a big Final Fantasy fan (okay, I still am, more or less). My first real experience with online fan communities was a Yahoo Groups mailing list called the \"Final Fantasy Forum\". It was a fun, tight-knit group that loved to discuss the FF series and other JRPGs of that era. The group was small, maybe 20-30 active members at peak, but it was also very active; it was not uncommon to have dozens of messages in a day, or even an hour. This was back in the days of dial-up internet here in the PH, so it was a bit challenging to keep up.\r\n\r\nBut I did keep up, and was quite active with the group, and eventually even became a moderator. I got to know some of the other active list members quite well, such that I considered them friends (in as much as people you've never met IRL can be friends in those days, at least). But as you all know, all good things must come to an end.\r\n\r\nThe bane of all good discussion groups is drama. First, the original list creator and owner came back from hibernation. Most of us mods had been second generation list members, we never really knew the original creator since he had gone inactive. At first we were all like \"Hey, welcome back!\" but then we quickly got into disagreements over how the group should be run. Over a tumultuous few days, he started kicking out and banning people who disagreed with him. I asked him for a dialogue and promptly got kicked out as well. Such was the fate of the FFF.\r\n\r\nOver the next couple of months, the old mods and members tried to re-establish the same community elsewhere. First, they set up an alternative Yahoo Groups list called \"The AntiFFF\" (I told them this was a terrible name), which appears to be the currently listed \"Final Fantasy Forum\" on Yahoo Groups. It had a burst of activity for a month or two, and I was there for a short while as well, but there was some disagreement on who should or should not be allowed into the new group, and there was no strong moderation so at some point there was a long debate about religion (another bane of discussion groups) which caused a lot of members to leave and group petered out shortly after. \r\n\r\nOne of the other ex-FFF mods who was made unwelcome at the AntiFFF messaged me and proposed we create a new group with a more general RPG topic, and we did get the old mod team together and did that, but that group didn't last very long either before activity petered out.   \r\n\r\n\r\nAround that time, Yahoo Groups itself started to wane in popular usage and everyone kind of drifted apart. I seem to have unsubbed from the last group about a year after it was formed. I only recently started looking into all of this again when I dug up some old emails that referenced the FFF. I don't even have copies of old emails from either the original group or the successor groups. Most of my recollection of events comes from what I remember and the fact that I can still go through the archives of the AntiFFF at the YG site.\r\n\r\nI was struck with a wave of nostalgia when I remembered all of this, and a little bit of regret that I didn't keep in touch with these folks that I interacted with regularly for the better part of 4-5 years. I tried to see if I could track down some of the members I could remember, but back then most of the list members went by aliases which are now defunct. I did manage to find Twitter accounts for a couple of the old members, but couldn't track down the old mod team that I worked closely with. For the rest, all I could find were now-defunct websites and domains and emails and handles for chat networks that aren't even around anymore. It was a completely different internet back then.\r\n\r\nIt feels kind of weird to miss those guys, since I never really knew them in person. These days virtually all of the people I interact with online are people I know IRL. (\"Virtually all\" because I do have some Twitter mutuals that I've never met in person but interact with regularly enough that we are aware of each other.) After the FFF and the derivative groups, I was never again actively a member of a community of \"strangers on the internet\" as it were.\r\n\r\nThis was all of fifteen-ish years ago, so I can only imagine that many of those peeps have vastly different lives now. Maybe they're no longer active online. Maybe they've outgrown video games. Maybe they're teaching their own kids now about Final Fantasy. Maybe they're all in different places now with different jobs and different hobbies, and none of them even remember the little mail group we had all that time ago. Or maybe someday some of them might stumble upon this post and say \"Hey the Final Fantasy Forum! I remember that group! Good times\"\r\n\r",

We teach students from a young age to follow rules and answer roll calls. We teach them standard prescribed solutions. We teach them how to take exams and how to find the right answers. Even school culture among students teaches kids to conform or be ostracized. Our school systems are optimized for generating employees for industry -- and in the old days industry meant factory workers, who knew just enough to get on an assembly line and put things together. Even today, we are told that the purpose of education is that we need it in order to get a good job.\r\n\r\nLocally, this talk became even more relevant when the Director General of the Philippine National Police questioned why state scholars \"go against the government\". This is a common line found in the comments section of news articles as well whenever students from universities would participate in protest actions against the government. As if by virtue of the government providing for the education of its citizens (as is their responsibility), the students now owe the government an unquestioning obedience and should turn a blind eye to any of the government's abuses. (This line of thinking seems to be primarily prominent during the current administration though -- I didn't really notice people commenting this way during previous admins despite the fact that students have \\always\\ tended to be more activist).\r\n\r\nFor me, this is working as intended. The purpose of the state sponsoring education shouldn't be in order to create obedient, unquestioning citizens. It should be to create citizens that are more discerning and analytical and able to make intelligent and informed decisions about the country's future. And we shouldn't be educating people simply so they can find good jobs (although that's part of the reason as well), we should also be educating them because an educated citizenry leads to a better society. (And when I say educated here, I assume there is an ethics component involved as well.)   \r\n\r\n\r\nStudent activism isn't a bug, it's a feature.\r\n\r\n(Of course, I'm not advocating that all students should be required to be activists, just that we shouldn't consider universities producing some percentage of students as activists as a problem.)\r\n\r",

In the dreams, \"home\" is not the home that I live in now. Instead it's the \"home\" I grew up in. It's my grandparents' house, where we lived until the right after the turn of the millenium.figure class=\"wp-block-image\"\r\n\r\nimg src=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/27993693101564077620189125283830136135427657o1.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2820\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/27993693101564077620189125283830136135427657o1.jpg 984w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/27993693101564077620189125283830136135427657o1-300x220.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/27993693101564077620189125283830136135427657o1-768x562.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/27993693101564077620189125283830136135427657_o1-600x439.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 984px) 100vw, 984px\" //figure \r\n\r\nThat house is no longer there; I've mentioned it before. But when I manage to remember my dreams it seems like it's still \"home\" for me. I distinctly remember some dreams where I come home to that rusty metal gate. I can't remember any instance where I recognize my current home in a dream.  \r\n\r\n\r\nI wonder why that is? I'm going to guess that my subconscious still considers that old house as \"home\", despite not having lived there for almost 18 years now. I don't know whether this is a common thing for people who have moved houses or I'm just especially attached to that house and the associated childhood memories.\r\n\r",

Prospects have ranged from my own software consulting firm to a food stall in an MRT station. None of these ideas never push through. Aside from general risk-aversion and not being confident in the ideas, there's a few factors that in my mind are significant obstacles towards starting a new business for me.\r\n\r\nGovernment red tape and paperwork\r\n\r\nI have a friend who manages a small business for his family, as he's often ranting about the situation here in the Philippines, about how there's always a lot of filing requirements, many of which don't make sense and are seemingly designed to make it easier for unscrupulous employees to bilk you for money. A direct quote: \"It is literally easier to cheat on taxes and filing requirements via connections/bribery than it is to make a good faith effort to follow regulations.\" This is not something I would want to deal with.\r\n\r\nHiring other people\r\n\r\nA while back I was discussing with someone the prospect of setting up a food stall franchise somewhere. They offered an affordable package and assistance, but I balked at the idea that I would have to find and hire someone to man the stall myself. I have enough trouble delegating my work to other people when I'm in a team of competent engineers. I find the idea of entrusting an entire store or stall in which I invested hard-earned money unnerving. I'm not sure I'd be able to properly identify someone trustworthy enough that I can leave them alone to handle such things.\r\n\r\nMarketing and Sales\r\n\r\nWith my background as an engineer, I'm not too fond of marketing and sales. However, I have spent the last couple of years working with a small startup, where I had a lot more visibility into the overall business process, so I guess I have a slightly better appreciation of marketing and sales now. These skills are largely focused on manipulating humans, whereas my own skillset is largely focused on manipulating computers. It doesn't help that a lot of marketing techniques and sales methods feel very \"scummy\" to me, like clickbait ads and so on. I know these can be done well and in ways that conform with my own personal code of honour, but still, in my head these skills constitute \"black arts\" and \"necessary evils.\" \r\n\r\nAll of these are hurdles I'd have to overcome if I ever really want to start a business. That, or I'd have to find business partners willing to handle all this drudge work for me so that I can focus on the parts I enjoy -- engineering and problem solving and implementation. Until then, I'll have to content myself with working as an independent consultant.",

The idea of 100 hour weeks seemed insane to me, and it got me thinking: I've done some serious overtime before, have I ever gotten close to that amount of work in a week?\r\n\r\nLuckily, I didn't have to speculate too much, because I had data (I love data). My previous employer had us track and log our work hours, and I had kept a copy of my own data after I left. That's working hours from 2003-2015. I crunched the numbers and I found that:\r\n\r\n  I had 633 weeks of data in all, from 2003 to 2015  \r\n    \r\n  I had 239 weeks where I worked more than 40 hours\r\n  I had 60 weeks where I worked more than 50 hours\r\n  I had 15 weeks where I worked more than 60 hours.\r\n  My record for number of hours in a single week was week 34 of 2015 where I had a whopping 80.50 hours in a single week. This was when I was deployed on-site to London and was also on call for support at the same time, so basically working all the time.\r\n\r\nSo luckily I've not been in the \"100-hour week\" situation that the RDR2 team found them in (though I came close). I'm not sure if this is an accurate representation of what it's like to work in the software industry in general, though I'm sure it's typical of my former workplace. Hopefully, overtime is something I can avoid or minimize in my own career moving forward.\r\n\r\nRead what I had to say before about overtime here.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://sea.ign.com/xbox-one-gaming-hardware/142536/news/rockstar-exec-clarifies-statement-about-red-dead-redemption\r",

At this rate, you can become an expert in 477 weeks. (Roughly 9 years and 2 months)\r\n\r\nAre there shortcuts to expertise? Probably talent can help some. But for most of us, it takes a whole lot of hard work. You can make things go faster if you like, but you need to sacrifice a lot.  \r\n\r\n\r\nPersonal note: I mentioned before that I had my own effort data from 2003-2015. The total is 23621.36 hours of work in various software development projects. I shouldn&#8217;t be shy about calling myself an expert, impostor syndrome be damned.\r\n\r",

Seeing the occasional art post wander across my feeds is often a welcome respite from the terrible news in the world today. I thought I'd share some of my favorites!\r\n\r\nJim Lee is a comic book icon and for me his very detailed and elaborate pencils epitomize 90s comic art and his style still heavily influences many newer artists today. He often posts his drawings on his instagram and he also has a Twitch channel where he occasionally livestreams himself drawing. I'm watching the stream right now as I'm typing this post! (Actually I should maybe follow more artists on Twitch...)\r\n\r\n{{ instagram BqaUsnKHWYf }}\r\n\r\nMarcio Takara is a relatively new comic book artist I discovered a couple of years ago. I haven't actually read too many of his comic book work, but I am a big fan of his instagram where he's always posting finished works and WIPs. His linework isn't as detailed as Jim Lee, it's a completely different and more cartoony style, but I like it. And his coloring is spot-on too! He also has a website.\r\n\r\n{{ instagram BriKMMWHm9o }}\r\n\r\nKenneth Rocafort was an artist I discovered when DC had their \"New 52\" reboot, his DC work includes Red Hood and the Outlaws and Superman. I'm a fan of his detailed pencils and his color work. He has an instagram and a twitter and he posts regularly, especially his drawings in a small notebook.\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 1055841158495113217 }}\r\n\r\nAndrea Sorrentino is an Italian comic book artist. I first encountered him doing the later part of the New 52 Green Arrow for DC. He later went on to do Old Man Logan and Uncanny X-Men work for Marvel. He seems to like working with Jeff Lemire. While writing this post, I found out they're currently doing a series for Image called Gideon Falls, now I want to read it! His illustrations and colors always have this surreal, otherworldly feel. He has a twitter, but he doesn't post his art there too much (other than sharing posts from others). He has a website that showcases his work.\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 1044300566032252934 }}\r\n\r\nClick Burgundy/Hungry Clicker is an artist I found on Twitter somehow, I don't know much about him other than he does great character portraits. He has a more anime aesthetic, and he draws mostly anime and fighting game characters, with the occasional character from some other pop culture like comic books etc.\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 1047534822644625408 }}\r\n\r\nThe Art of Animation is a Tumblr blog that showcases art from different artists with a varied set of art styles. Many of the works are super detailed and most are really good. The variety of styles means you might not like all the posts, but following them can be good for finding new styles you like.\r\n\r\n div class=\"tumblr-post\" data-href=\"https://embed.tumblr.com/embed/post/wGqSqJXCjr5ficjZcsYJKA/180270794364\" data-did=\"ef21cf56cdc5926ab88c4bf0dd53e44ab552d053\"a href=\"http://theartofanimation.tumblr.com/post/180270794364/bangqiao-yan\"http://theartofanimation.tumblr.com/post/180270794364/bangqiao-yan/a/div  script async src=\"https://assets.tumblr.com/post.js\"/script\r\n\r\nThat's it for now!

It's a type of envy of other people's lives and as a type of envy it's also a form of regret for our own life choices.\r\n\r\nFOMO is rightly called a fear, and like all irrational fears, it should be dismissed as soon as one recognizes it. I had the draft of the first part of this post for a while, but after revisiting it, I realized how much it applied to one of my own decisions I'm faced with right now. I've already evaluated the decision and have made a rational assessment, but my irrational subconscious is giving me some hesitation. I realize now that the hesitation comes from a place of fear, specifically a fear of missing out on opportunities and experiences by giving up on the other choice. \r\n\r\nWe can't live our lives with the fear of regret or missing out, that can only lead us to indecision and paralysis. I try to live without FOMO and one of my own personal life tenets is to \"Choose without regret\". As long as I made the best decision I could given the information I had at the time, I will not have any regrets. \r\n\r\n(Pretty sure an attitude of FOMO is one of the main reason social media use can lead to depression too!)",

Or to avoid any semblance of doubt I could specify the actual date, \"this weekend, on the 4th\" as my mom did.\r\n\r\nThis reminds me of a conversation I had with a client some time ago (paraphrased because we don't have enough Slack archives for me to find the conversation that far back):\r\n\r\n Me: \"Ok, our dev estimates that this can be done in two days. We can have it ready for testing by next Thursday.\"\r\n \r\n Client: \"Why would it take so long? Is no one available to do it now?\"\r\n \r\n Me: \"What do you mean? We're going to start it immediately, Thursday is two days from now.\"\r\n \r\n Client: \"Oh you meant this Thursday, the 15th... I see.\"\r\n\r\nSo, he initially assumed that I meant Thursday next week. While for me my usage of \"next\" is perfectly logical according to the definition of \"immediately succeeding\", I can understand where it might cause some confusion. So from now on, I should remember to avoid using \"next\" and prefer to specify explicitly what I'm talking about.",

I've been thinking about this lately as I try to plan for what's ahead and what I want. I think one has to be able to decide what one wants independently of what other people are doing. \r\n\r\nAs a concrete example, it's easy to fall into the trap of \"Oh, this other person in my field did X and now they are making so much money, should I take that path as well?\" In a situation like this it's helpful to ask yourself if \"more money\" is really what you want. Sure, \"more money\" is always good, but you need to consider what you are giving up in exchange for that money. Is X really something you want to be doing? Or would you be miserable doing it? Sometimes you decide that the tradeoff is okay, I'll give up a little happiness in exchange for a little more money, and that's fine if that's what you really want. But that conclusion should come from knowing what it is you want and you need, not out of envy for what other people have.\r\n\r\nIt's especially difficult to avoid comparison to other people in the modern age of social media. It's just another form of FOMO. You have to remember that what people project on social media isn't often the entire picture of their lives. They are more likely to hold back on the failures, troubles, problems, and other negative aspects that they have to go through. Comparing your own life to others on social media is inherently an imbalanced situation - you will have a tendency to compare your worst days against their best days.\r\n\r\nIt can also be challenging and tempting to compare yourself to other people when you find yourself wanting to make unconventional choices. In such a case, even society itself will sometimes challenge you with comparison. It's important to have a firm understanding of what you want for yourself, to avoid falling into the trap of letting comparison decide to take away your joy.\r\n\r\nI guess the saying isn't absolute. Comparison can be a good thing, as long as it's used in service of what you truly want.",

When I took a work hiatus in 2016, it was one of the daily habits I promised myself I would pick up. During that time, I wanted to hit the often-recommended daily target of 10,000 steps per day. (Tangent: I found out while writing this post that this number may have no scientific basis after all)\r\n\r\nBack then, all I had to track my steps was the dinky Samsung health app that came with my Galaxy phone. It was good enough, at least at first. At some point I switched to the Google Fit app. Neither app was super accurate though. I started with a modest target, and slowly ramped up to 10,000 steps per day, which I hit sometime near the end of 2016. (Frustratingly, I can't find my daily records of my step counts from that year. I'm sure I had them in a spread sheet of some kind somewhere...)\r\n\r\nOne thing I learned on these daily walks is that I don't like repetition. I had been trying to get into the daily habit even before my work hiatus, but because of limited time, I only went a short distance from home and just did laps around a nearby basketball court or subdivision. This however was hard for me to keep up because I found it terribly boring. During 2016, since I had more time, what I did was I would walk as far away from home as possible until I hit half my target, then I'm also forced to walk all the way back and meet my target. And because I dislike repetition, I seldom took the same route on succeeding days. \r\n\r\nA pleasant side effect of this method is that I got a better layout of the geography near our house. I've lived here for more than a decade, but haven't really explored the nearby areas that much because when you're a working joe you don't really have that much time for exploratory walks. And I would walk pretty far too, something like 8-10 km a day. I went down roads I never travelled, visited small malls I never knew of, walked all the way to a friend's house, sometimes even walked through some sketchy-looking neighborhoods and so on. It's also happened more than once that a friend I don't see too often but lives nearby will say to me \"Hey, I saw someone who looks like you walking around [my neighborhood]!\"\r\n\r\nAround mid-2017, my brother got me a Fitbit Charge 2, so I switched to that for my step counting. By this time, I had been maintaining the 10,000 step target for a while after I hit it, but when I started working regularly again I started to slip and often found myself only hitting 2 or 3 thousand a day. I've been trying to ramp it up again the past few months, but I find that usually 10,000 steps takes way too much time, in the neighborhood of 1.5-2 hours of walking, depending on my pace. Maybe I'll still ramp up to that step count but I'll take it a lot slower this time. \r\n\r\nThese days, my daily target is now a more manageable 6,000 to 8,000 steps a day, and I have more regular routes I follow. It somehow feels a bit more challenging to do this regularly in 2018 as the weather now seems much hotter than it used to be (that, or I had gotten used to being in an air-conditioned office again). I find my walks now more often happen after dusk, which makes them a bit more dangerous (these are Metro Manila streets after all), despite what a certain former DFA secretary might say. I just try to avoid wandering through shady streets these days.\r\n\r\nAlso, according to the fitbit logs, I've clocked in around 2.8 million steps since I got the fitbit, over around 500 days, more or less 5,500 steps per day. While it's not ideal, I think it's a lot more than I used to get regularly, and I am able to burst to 10,000 every so often. Hopefully I can get back to 10,000 regularly soonish.",

Social media algorithms optimize for engagement (eyeballs, views, likes, whatever, etc). Meanwhile, humans are more likely to engage with controversial content. Everyday status quo content is boring by comparison. Hence, controversial or extremist content will tend to bubble to the top. \r\n\r\nIt's the same reason politics has made social media divisive -- promoting divisive content has turned out to be profitable in terms of engagement. This was happening before with mass media, but on a slower scale. With the worldwide internet, the spread of divisive and extremist content has accelerated rapidly. \r\n\r\nIt will be interesting to see how society counterbalances these forces, if at all.\r\n\r",

Recently though I've started following more sources and blogs that are focused on more... \"cultural\" affairs. When I started doing #sketchdaily a couple of years ago, I started following more artists. During the past few months, as a sort of counterbalance to the prevalently negative current events and tech industry news, I've also begun following a few more people who are focused more on things like philosophy, history, poetry, literature, creativity, and so on. A lot of it goes over my head - I don't really have any formal background in the humanities - but many times I come upon posts I appreciate and that help expand my horizons and point me down new avenues of thinking. And I can still enjoy good art and good poetry and good prose.\r\n\r\nI have also purposely cut back a bit on the more political follows, especially on Twitter. Following current events feels a lot like being a spectator at a car crash; everything is terrible, but you can't help but be fascinated by what's going on. Even much of the tech industry news tends to be negative - Facebook has done something horrible; there's a new data breach; people are spending too much time on their computers; big tech is helping fascist countries do censorship; and so on. It's too easy to lose yourself in current events and be angry all the time about the state of the world or the country or our leadership. I'm not planning to disconnect completely from the news, like some people do, and I'm still always open to discussion about any topic (though I have decided to be more restrained in my urge to debate people and respond to every possible outrage). \r\n\r\nI still believe that good citizens have a responsibility to stay abreast of what's going on in the world and to be informed so that we can make good decisions. But that doesn't mean it has to be outrage 24/7. We're not going to run out of bad news any time soon. We have to find the space as well for appreciating what's good in life and for broadening our horizons.",

This is why we have search engines and indexes and maps. This is why bookstores and groceries and department stores try to sort their wares into logical arrangements, to facilitate this efficient search.\r\n\r\nNot everything needs to be efficient however. There's something to be said for exploration - browsing, meandering, walking down new paths, and so on. Browsing and exploration are a means of discovery - a means of finding things which you wouldn't have known to search for. Many times there might be nothing remarkable to find, but sometimes you get lucky and you find something new or something extraordinary or something to latch on to. \r\n\r\nPurely random discovery might be too much of a waste of time though. Filtered discovery might be better - exploring avenues related to or similar to things you already like. For a while now I've been adding new blogs to my Feedly reading lists, and many times when reading posts from one interesting blog they link to another one that I also find interesting, so the collection can grow quickly. It will also often happen that those blogs have slightly different interests than mine, and so I find myself exposed to something a bit outside of my usual spheres. If it's of interest, it's an opportunity for growth. If not, well, not all exploration can be fruitful, right?\r\n\r\nIn this age of echo chambers, maybe we all need a bit more discovery in our lives.",

I liked it so much that I now use it as my regular alarm tone.

(Actually, this is mainly an excuse to write down a story about how stupid I am.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, yeah my bro got me a Fitbit. Or maybe I paid for it. I don't really recall. The point is, I had it and I've been using it regularly for the past year and a half. It's a great little gizmo, not only do I use it for step counts, but it also lets me track how much sleep I'm getting (which is why I know how rare a regular continuous 8-hour sleep is for me, even when I'm not working). I'm a big fan of measuring my own data for self-improvement purposes so I like it. Conveniently, it also works with IFTTT, so I have an applet that exports my daily data to the a Google Sheets for easy reference. In theory I could also use the Fitbit to track stuff like my food intake and weight, but those don't happen automatically so I don't. Maybe someday. The fitbit itself doesn't use too much battery and has an Android app that syncs with the device via bluetooth (so I have bluetooth on all the time now).\r\n\r\nOne minor nitpick I have is that it my wrist doesn't seem to like the fitbit too much, after a while I realized it was growing darker where I wore it. My brother suggested maybe I was wearing the wrist strap too tightly. After this realization, I sometimes started wearing it on the other wrist when I felt like it.\r\n\r\nOkay, on to the stupid story! About 4 or 5 months after i started using the fitbit, this happened:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOh noes! Normally you can just snap the strap part back into place, but this time something had come off and it wouldn't stick back. I didn't want to spend money on a replacement strap, so in a brilliant move that I would surely never regret, I glued it back into place with Mighty Bond. This worked well! The strap held in place and I could now use the fitbit again without worry.\r\n\r\nFast-forward another seven months or so later, and now the strap on the other side came off too! AND around the same time, my charger thingy fell apart as well, and I could not put it back together! Oh noes! Was this the end of my fitbit experiment? \r\n\r\nLuckily it turns out a friend owned an online shop that could get me a replacement strap and charger for a good price (check out FitbitManila on Facebook if you're interested), and it would be delivered to my house. All I had to do was wait a few days. During that time I was unable to charge the fitbit so it died.\r\n\r\nWhen the goods arrived, I attempted to replace the faulty half-strap only. I couldn't remove the other side since it was glued into place! What a surprising twist, I did regret that decision from just three paragraphs ago! And to make it worse, for some reason the replacement strap was not the same width as the older strap, so I can't use the old half with the new half! I was forced to pry apart the glued half-strap, and I did eventually manage to do it, and now my fitbit was whole again, and I think I lost a couple of days data? Actually when I charged the fitbit again it was no longer sync'ed to my phone and I had to reinstall it. The replacement strap felt a bit off, but I got used to it soon enough, and here we are half a year later and I'm still using the Fitbit, hooray! Stupidity overcome!\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm quite happy with my year and a half of fitbit usage. I'm told that the devices themselves last fairly long, even if the straps don't, so I hope to be using it for at least a couple of years more, maybe? I'll try never to glue the straps again.",

I don't want to do work that doesn't interest me.\r\n\r\nSomeone shared this image to me a while back:\r\n\r\nimg class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2488\" src=\"http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG20171001121426847.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1027\" height=\"759\" srcset=\"https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG20171001121426847.jpg 1027w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG20171001121426847-300x222.jpg 300w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG20171001121426847-768x568.jpg 768w, https://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/IMG20171001121426_847-1024x757.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1027px) 100vw, 1027px\" /\r\n\r\nI was looking at this diagram and it really solidified in my mind that in all likelihood I'll never really pursue entrepreneurship.\r\n\r\nI get the personal satisfaction circle, everyone wants that. It's the economic feasibility and market opportunity circles that kind of throw it out of whack for me.\r\n\r\nI'm not ruling it out or anything. I mean, for sure I could come up with a killer game design idea that I actually manage to implement that becomes a hit with a niche market and suddenly takes off. There's always that chance.\r\n\r\nBut I have no interest in studying markets or marketing or promotion or selling to people in general. And a lot of my interests are niche so that gets in the way of economic feasibility.\r\n\r\nLike when I have an idea for something I want to build, I don't think about marketing opportunity or economic feasibility or anything. I just start building it.\r\n\r\nI like building things. I like solving problems. I like studying systems and figuring out how they work and what problems they have that are solvable and what not.\r\n\r\nBut the idea of having to sell those solutions, to find people to finance my time, to do marketing work and reaching out and networking and promotion, etc. For me, that's just hard work that I'm inclined to avoid.\r\n\r\nAnd I do avoid a lot of hard work that I don't want to do. This is probably why I tend to leave a lot of half-finished projects behind. This is why it's best for me to be working in a team and having other people willing to do those tasks I dislike.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then why not hire some people to do that other work for you?\" I can do that, sure. That involves some capital, but I have some capital and surely I can raise more if needed. But doing the due diligence to figure out whether the idea is feasible enough to work on, meaning the investment of capital is worth it -- that in itself is something I don't want to do. What more trying to convince people to raise capital for me.\r\n\r\nAnd again, because of my niche interests, a lot of ideas that I tend to think of tend to fall into the \"I think this is cool, but it doesn't seem to be likely to be profitable\" bucket.\r\n\r\nWell-meaning go-getters will be all \"Well, that's just a defeatist attitude! You can do anything if you put your mind to it! Stop thinking of reasons why you can't do it!\" Yes it's true. It's just a matter of attitude. The human brain is just another system after all, and one only needs to study one's one own system to figure out how to maybe hack it to figure out how to get into some kind of \"entrepreneurship mode.\" But again, it doesn't interest me. Maybe someday it will.\r\n\r\nI can't speak for the future, but at the moment I think the most likely way I'd become an entrepreneur is by accident. Stumble into something that happens to be profitable. I don't think I can do it on purpose.\r\n\r\nI realize this post is kind of a downer. A really negative post full of \"I can't do it\" kind of statements. Don't take this to mean I don't appreciate people sharing entrepreneurship advice or articles, I do. And please keep them coming. But I think it's worth the time to study your own psyche and understand what holds you back so that when the time comes you know what you need to be able to set aside. Who knows, maybe next week I'll be writing why I should and can be an entrepreneur.\r\n\r",

        "content": "---\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2018-11-24 02:00:21\r\nfeaturedImage: https://roytang.net/uploads/2018/ipad_screen.jpg\r\npublishdate: 2018-11-24 02:00:21\r\ntags:\r\nTech Life\r\ntitle: iPad Restrospective\r\n---\r\n\r\nLooking back on 8 years of apple tablets.\r\n\r\nI got my first iPad (1st generation!) back in 2010 with 64gb storage. This version was purchased for me by a friend in Singapore. I got the 3g model back then, but I never got around to using that feature. Future purchases would be wifi only. My main usage for the iPad back then was for reading ebooks/comics and playing some games. I spent a lot of time on Tilt to Live on that bad boy.\r\n\r\nMy first upgrade was a 4th generation iPad that I asked a friend to buy for me in Hong Kong in October 2012. This was a straight upgrade for performance reasons. The 1st gen iPad was already having trouble with modern apps and the latest iOS, my usage for it was pretty much the same. I think the game I played the most on the 2nd iPad was Mika Mobile's Battleheart. Come to think of it I don't think I ever finished that game, I wonder if my save would still be there if I reinstalled it.\r\n\r\nMy current iPad Pro is my 3rd apple tablet. It's a 1st generation iPad Pro (2015) with 128gb, which I bought around this time in 2016. At this time, my previous iPad was still doing well, but my main motivation for getting the iPad Pro was the Apple Pencil. I had started getting back into drawing as a hobby and wanted to explore digital sketching. With my previous iPad I had tried purchasing some kind of capacitive stylus, but those never worked out, as the precision was never good enough for my liking. The Apple Pencil solved those issues and has been great, it's a fantastic product. Most of my digital drawing is done using Procreate, although I also tried a few other apps like Paper by 53 and Autodesk Sketchbook Pro. I could also be using the Apple Pencil for note taking, and I have done so on occasion, but I'm not that much of a note taker so this doesn't come up often. When I do use it, I find the handwriting functionality fairly good as well. My note-taking app of choice is ???.\r\n\r\nDespite being my newest iPad and being only two years old, this one is the least well-maintained and is experiencing some problems. It already has quite a few cracks on the display, so it looks quite worse for the wear. (See the visible cracks in the image below.) I don't think the cracks are on the display itself, probably on the thin protective layer on top, because the cracks extend over the bezels. I suspect this is due to me banging my bag around too much. The battery life also seems much worse these days, I'm not sure if that's due to the most recent version of iOS. When my niece comes over she always drains the battery with her Youtubes and weird games.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the most mysterious problem is an incessant beeping. It's been happening for a while, but I haven't been able to figure out yet. Basically, at times the iPad will beep continuously, as if it was being repeatedly plugged and unplugged into the charger. It happens most often when I'm lying in bed holding the iPad above me at an angle or at my side. I can't identify whether it happens due to position or something else. Also, it's rare for it to happen when I'm using the iPad in some other place or position. And it never happens when I'm not using the iPad. I'm starting to suspect that it has to do with some sort of static charge caused by my hands and the bed somehow, but that seems ridiculous. That, or my iPad has developed sentience and is trying to communicate with me through beeps. (That theory gives a fun image whenever I put the iPad down and the beeping starts to taper off.)\r\n\r\nSpeaking of charger problems, another issue I have with Apple tablets in general is hardware-related but not with the tablet itself - the problem is their lightning cables, which tend to rapidly fall apart over time. I'm talking the official Apple lightning cables here. I've tried some unoffical ones as well, but those seem highly inconsistent as to whether they'll even work, so I tend to prefer the official ones. I just wish they lasted longer.\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 382888558639333376 }}\r\n\r\nSome friends have told me that supposedly the cable material is not very tolerant of our tropical heat. Apple needs to be better than this! More pictures (these are 3 different cables.):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRe: apps. When I first got the iPad, I did indulge myself in purchasing a few apps, mostly games like the aforementioned Tilt to Live and Battleheart. Gaming on the iPad is okay, but as can be expected it's a big battery drain. I often got iPad versions of \"real\" games like Street Fighter, Injustice, and so on. But I stopped buying apps in 2013. I don't know my rationale at the time, but I do know today that buying apps on the iPad is extremely problematic for one reason: rapid changes in iOS. The programming APIs change rapidly, and apps will often need to be updated to work with more recent versions of iOS, and many app developers won't bother keeping up. That means many apps will tend to be short-lived - I checked my purchase history and roughly more than half of my previously purchased apps could not even be downloaded anymore. (Not sure if this would be alleviated by using older iOS versions). Maybe I'm spoiled by backward compatibility on Windows, where I can basically still run software from two decades ago. These days, my iPad gaming is mostly just Words with Friends.\r\n\r\nAside from drawing and gaming, my other main usage is for reading. I use both iBooks and the Kindle app and also Comic Flow for comics. At any given time, my tablet is loaded with hundreds of books and comics, so it's hard to run out of things to read even if there's no internet. I still enjoy reading physical books, but having a fairly large library easily accessible is great too. This is the main reason I often get high-storage versions even though they're a lot more expensive.\r\n\r\nAll in all, I'm happy with my iPad purchases so far, I've used them constantly, and even the older models are still in use by other family members. I will admit I am tempted by the recently announced new iPad Pro iteration, especially given the problems my current iPad already has. It's attractive for me mainly due to the Pencil now being able to be docked on the iPad itself and the reports that it performs about as well as a Macbook. These tablets are quite expensive though, and I've already made one big tech purchase this year (more on that in a future post I guess), so I'm skipping on the new iPad Pro for now. Maybe next year.",

I remember I bought the game for Steam on launch day. I finally \"finished\" it after 350 hours of gameplay and seven years real-time. \"Finished\" in this case means \"achievement complete\", not just \"main quest complete\", because as any Bethesda gamer knows, that&#8217;s not how their RPGs roll.\r\n\r\nI had been looking forward to this game because I had previously enjoyed both ES4: Oblivion and Fallout 3 on PS3 and had also just finished Fallout: New Vegas on Steam and was open to more open-world exploration. I remember being tempted by the badass collector&#8217;s edition Alduin statue too but opted out due to price and the fact that it was huge. \r\n\r\nMy first character was a male Nord named Hunter. I actually managed to finish the main quest a bit more than a month after getting the game (fairly fast!). I used that first character to complete all the guild quests -- Companions, Mage&#8217;s Guild, Thieves Guild, Dark Brotherhood. Afterwards I immersed myself with the open world and toyed around with mods for a bit. I played it on and off again for a few years, and buying the DLC expansions (Hearthfire, Dawnguard and Dragonborn) eventually when they were on sale. I started a few other runs but never got far. \r\n\r\nIn 2016, I started my final run -- the character that I would be able to bring to \"achievement completion\" including all DLCs. This final character was Arche, an Imperial (named after the Tales of Phantasia character).figure class=\"wp-block-image\"\r\n\r\nfigcaptionMy final armor set was the Deathbrand from the Dragonborn expansion since I was trying to level up Light Armor./figcaption/figure \r\n\r\nAnyway, I greatly enjoyed this game obviously. It&#8217;s been available for a while and been ported to every platform imaginable (it even got a new console release this year!), so there&#8217;s not much point talking about the features and whatnot. There are some other things I&#8217;d like to cover though:\r\n\r\nLevelling Up and Legendary Dragons\r\n\r\nThe last achievement I got was the one for killing a legendary dragon, which took me forever. The first issue was that legendary dragon&#8217;s don&#8217;t spawn unless you&#8217;re already level 78. In my 2nd run, I finished the Dawnguard and Dragonborn content and all other achievements by around level 50, and it was a grind to get to level 78 througn conventional means. I didn&#8217;t want to do any console cheats to get to 78, so I tried to look for faster ways to level up. There&#8217;s a bunch of suggestions on the internet, but here are the best ones:\r\n\r\n  Telekinesis -- with enchantments to reduce MP cost, you can use Telekinesis to quickly level up Alteration, simply by levitating an object in front of you until you run out of magic, then you just rest and repeat. This method was still fairly slow for me though and more importantly it was really boring. I read some posts saying you could speed up this process by levitating an object then doing fast travel to a far location so that the game thinks you were using Telekinesis during the entire trip, but I could never get this to work and that feels a bit too exploit-y for me.\r\n  Giant blocking -- basically go find a camp with high level giants, then keep blocking their attacks with your shield, healing when necessary. The advantage of this is that it increases multiple skills -- Block, Restoration and Light/Heavy Armor (depending on what you&#8217;re wearing). However, it wasn&#8217;t much faster than the Telekinesis method and it was also quite tedious and if you weren&#8217;t careful, you could die.\r\n  Finally, I came upon, in my opinion, the single fastest way to level up in Skyrim: the Illusion mastery spell Harmony. You can use Muffle to level up your Illusion until you learn Harmony, but once you have Harmony, things go into overdrive. You simply go into the middle of Whiterun (near the plaza is fine, or that big tree in the middle section) and cast Harmony. The spell has a very, very wide AOE so it affects almost all citizens, gaining you ridiculous amounts of Illusions skill levels. A single casting can earn you as much as 50+ Illusion levels. This method is quick, safe, easy, and I wish I had discovered it earlier. As it is, it took me from 68 to 81 in around an hour.  \r\n    \r\n\r\nAfter getting to Level 81, the next problem was actually finding a Legendary Dragon to fight. Supposedly there was one that always spawns at Arcwind Point, but I never got one to spawn there, even after clearing my mods. I tried fast-travelling across dragon burial grounds for a while with no luck. Eventually I managed to randomly find a Legendary Dragon while wandering near Dragon Bridge (that&#8217;s where my last save is!)\r\n\r\nMods\r\n\r\nI had a \\lot\\ of mods installed, mostly additional gameplay/quests, additional items added to the game world, convenience mods (adding map markers etc), or stuff to improve the ambience. I&#8217;m not much for stuff like graphics improvements or silly mods that add Thomas the Tank Engine or Macho Man dragons. I did have this mod that added Star Wars lightsabers to the game that I wanted to get rid of but I had so many mods installed I always gave up trying to find it on the list. The best mods I used throughout my 350 hours were:\r\n\r\n  Forgotten City -- this mods add a self-contained quest that involves time travel, groundhog day-style time loops, multiple paths to resolution and investigating a mystery. It was so good it got turned into its own standalone game.\r\n  Stan Bush combat music -- basically replaces Skyrim&#8217;s combat music Stan Bush&#8217;s songs \"The Touch\" and \"Dare\" from&nbsp;Transformers The Movie,&nbsp;giving you a quick adrenaline boost when combat starts. I didn&#8217;t actually notice that Skyrim had separate combat music before I installed this mod!\r\n  That&#8217;s it, out of literally two hundred mods only two stood out for me lol.\r\n\r\nWishlist for Elder Scrolls 6 (or things I wish they had done in Skyrim)\r\n\r\n  Make the shovel useful -- it&#8217;s weird that there&#8217;s a shovel object in the game but it&#8217;s not really used for anything, not even as a weapon (I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s mods that do that), but I was thinking stuff like buried treasure quests could require you to have a shovel to dig up chests or maybe you can randomly dig in the dirt and hope for goodies (one of the Zelda games did this AFAICR)\r\n  Mountain climbing -- okay, this wish is straight from Breath of the Wild. One of the best things about BOTW was the ability to climb anywhere, a refreshing addition to an open world overworld after Skyrim&#8217;s \"How the heck do I get to the top of this mountain\" challenge.\r\n  More immersion in the Hearthfire DLC -- don&#8217;t get me wrong, I liked the Hearthfire DLC, it added a nice opportunity for role-playing with the chance to get married and adopt kids, makes for some nice stories and fun moments like this. After a while everything falls into a rut though, it would have been nice if they had expanded the Hearthfire content with some additional radiant quests. Some random ideas: Your wife or one of your kids goes missing, you have to find her; bandits threaten your house and you and your family have to defend it; you gave one of your kids two many daggers and now he accidentally stabbed one of his friends; your entire house has vanished along with your family! It has been teleported somewhere!\r\n  Actually just more radiant quests in general would have been nice for a bit more variance (I&#8217;m not sure if I will ever be satisfied). I think there&#8217;s already mods that do this, but I never tried them out.\r\n  The ability to take over a fort after you clear it. Skyrim has a lot of small forts or buildings held by bandits or whatever, it would have been a nice alternative to buying a house, after you clear a bandit the Jarl of the containing hold offers you a chance to buy/earn the title for the hold. Once you own a hold, whenever you recruit new followers you can choose to send them to the hold instead of following you around, and same as the house you could build improvements like a smith, stables, etc, and earn money from shops maybe?\r\n\r\nI also have the Legendary Edition on Steam (free upgrade since I had the DLCs), but I don&#8217;t think I have the patience to go through the entire game again. The size of the game and the excellent mod community mean one could very well play Skyrim forever, especially since Bethesda tells us&nbsp;The Elder Scrolls 6 is still a ways away. Unfortunately, there are still a lot of other games to play, and now I&#8217;m finally able to uninstall Skyrim. But before that here&#8217;s an Imgur dump of my Steam screenshots folder:figure class=\"wp-block-embed-imgur wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-imgur\"\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/ZWNxtnz\"a href=\"//imgur.com/a/ZWNxtnz\"/a/blockquotescript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"/script\r\n\r\n [1]: https://i.imgur.com/0mR5pvs.png\r\n [2]: https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/70219/\r\n [3]: https://store.steampowered.com/app/874260/TheForgottenCity/\r\n [4]: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=720815421\r\n [5]: https://tumblr.roytang.net/post/174535189435/playing-skyrim-i-have-my-wife-aela-and-adopted\r",

I thought I&#8217;d look back at a number of text editors I&#8217;ve used over the years. (I grew up with Windows, so I won&#8217;t list vim/emacs/nano here, even though I&#8217;m at least a bit proficient with vim by now. That is, I know how to exit vim.)\r\n\r\n  Notepad -- of course, the default editor in Windows. The one we turn to when all else fails. It used to be pretty bad at handling UTF-8 and probably just gives up on large files, but for quick and dirty work, it&#8217;s sufficient.  \r\n    \r\n  Crimson Editor -- relatively useful. First editor I used with multiple tab support and find in files. The first team lead I worked with (who I affectionately call \"boss\" to this day), recommended this to me mostly because she thought the dog icon was cute.\r\n  UltraEdit -- a very powerful editor, lots of features. We mostly used it back then for the superior UTF-8 handling and for the ability to open very large files. However, it has one glaring flaw that prevented me from using it too much: It&#8217;s not free.\r\n  Notepad++ -- I think this had roughly the same if not slightly larger feature set as Crimson Editor. But it was well-maintained and received regular updates, even up til now. (The latest update was a few weeks ago.)\r\n  Eclipse -- ok, I&#8217;ll include IDEs in this list. Most of my early career was in Java web development, and our IDE of choice was Eclipse. Slow-as-hell, always-compiling, unforgiving Eclipse. It had a rich features set, but again, hella slow, even among Java IDEs. Still, I spent enough hours with it to become fairly proficient with it and I even published a few internal blog posts on the most useful shortcuts and how to get the most out of the IDE.  \r\n    \r\n  Visual Studio .NET -- I actually had experience with the older Visual Studio versions, since we had a few legacy VC++ programs we had to maintain, but that was minimal at best so I don&#8217;t have much familiarity there. But then we had a C# project and I used VS.NET for a while. I didn&#8217;t care much for the C# language, but I did enjoy that VS.NET was way faster than Eclipse and especially enjoyed how good the Intellisense feature was.\r\n  Atom -- when I left my long-time job and started considering other directions to take my career, I considered using Atom because it was open source and I had long wanted to get into open source, and I figured what better way to get involved than to help improve your own tools right? Sadly, while I liked Atom&#8217;s feature set, I was turned off by its incredibly poor performance and loading times.\r\n  Sublime Text -- Sublime is so good. Extensive feature set, good performance. Only downside is that it&#8217;s not free, although it was so good I considered actually paying for version 3 at one point. Luckily I didn&#8217;t before deciding to try out my current text editor of choice:\r\n  VS Code -- VS Code is great. It&#8217;s free and it&#8217;s open source and it&#8217;s cross-platform. It has a good feature set. It&#8217;s super extendable and it has a vibrant extensions ecosystem. It performs reasonably well. I&#8217;d say not as fast as Sublime on startup, but way more tolerable than Atom. Once it&#8217;s loaded it&#8217;s blazing fast. It also inherited my favorite feature from VS.NET, Intellisense! Microsoft did a good job with this one. And I was able to have my first pull request for VS code merged into the codebase a few weeks ago! (I can now officially claim to be an open source contributor? Lol) I&#8217;ve only been using VS Code for a short while (less than half a year) so I&#8217;m sure I have yet to tap into its full potential, but I feel it&#8217;s deep enough that it will greatly improve my workflows as I gain more mastery over it.\r\n\r\n [1]: http://www.crimsoneditor.com/\r\n [2]: https://www.ultraedit.com/\r\n [3]: https://notepad-plus-plus.org/\r\n [4]: https://www.eclipse.org/\r\n [5]: https://atom.io/\r\n [6]: https://www.sublimetext.com/\r\n [7]: https://code.visualstudio.com/\r",

This of course turned out a bit bad in the short run. I was easily distracted from whatever work I was doing -- although I did take pride in being pretty good at multitasking (Yes I know, no one is \\really\\ good at multitasking, I'm just less bad at it than other people). I think in the long run was a problem too, somehow my brain has been rewired to instinctively always want to reply quickly to everything when it isn't necessary, and even when I'm not on the clock.\r\n\r\nThings got worse when we had this project that required our team to provide off-hours support. As you can imagine, that led to me checking emails and IMs all the time. I think I've developed a sort of notification anxiety, where if I hear my phone make a notification sound I'm always tempted to get up and check it. And of course there's the common social problem nowadays of always checking your phone compulsively while you have it in your hand. There's some kind of FOMO there that might be some kind of crisis or emergency I have to respond to.   \r\n\r\n\r\nI've started modifying the settings on my phone so I don't get too many notifications. I've turned off many noncrucial notifications; I don't really need a notification telling me someone liked a Tweet I made or that it's my turn on Words with Friends. If there's something urgent, I expect people to call.   \r\n\r\n\r\nResponsiveness is good for software systems but maybe not for humans.",

That was in Feb 2017. I stopped playing Duelyst after around six months. I started playing Eternal regularly July of that year, and have been playing regularly ever since.\r\n\r\nWhat changed my mind? I'm not sure, but once I got around to playing Eternal regularly, I found myself enjoying it. I think one of the main factors is that out of all the online ccgs I've tried, Eternal is the one that's closest to Magic the Gathering. That's not really surprising, since a number of Eternal's lead designers are MTG Pros and Hall of Famers. As such, my review will tend to compare Eternal to MTG.\r\n\r\nEternal games play out almost exactly like MTG games. Each player plays mana sources (called Power in eternal), then uses his pool to play creatures and spells to interact with the enemy. You send in creatures to attack and deal damage to the enemy until the enemy's life total is at 0 (Eternal starts at 25 life vs MTG's 20.), the enemy can send his units to block your attackers, and so on. Eternal feels like a smoother, more streamlined MTG. I'm also playing MTG Arena regularly these days, so I know that by comparison Eternal's games feel like they flow quicker and finish faster.\r\n\r\nSome of the relevant changes that I believe make it feel like a faster MTG:\r\n\r\nlimited fast effect windows. This is the main one. MTG Arena has to stop and ask you what you want to do every time there's an opportunity to play fast effects, and there's tons. In Eternal, there are only three windows: during combat, at the end of the enemy's turn, and whenever the enemy plays a spell. And you can only play fast spells (basically MTG instants), there are no creature abilities to activate at instant speed.\r\nthe game will automatically pass priority whenever you don't have any relevant plays. MTG Arena does this automatically as well. You can turn it off, since it has a bit of disadvantage (it conveys information to the opponent)\r\nsimilar to HS, Eternal limits the number of creatures you can have on the board. Eternal allows twelve on each side vs Heathstone's seven. This is more due to technical constraints than anything else. MTG Arena has to play the same on paper, so you can crash the game by generating some large number of creatures somehow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEternal's power system is similar to MTG's mana system - you have to draw cards that provide power the same way that you have to draw lands in MTG. This means one of MTG's inherent \"problems\" - mana screw - still happens in Eternal. In fact, on the forums mana screw is one of the complaints that often comes out (I suspect from former HearthStone players). Coming from MTG, I understand that building your deck to avoid mana screw is one of the skills needed in games like Magic and Eternal. Eternal eases the problem a little bit with its mulligan mechanic: Eternal gives you one free mulligan, and the 2nd hand is guaranteed to have 2-4 power. As I write this, they are also experimenting with allowing a 2nd mulligan that drops your starting hand size by one, still with the guarantee of 2-4 power.\r\n\r\nColor screw can still be a problem in Eternal, if you don't have enough of the correct influence (Eternal's analogue to color), you can't play cards that require that influence. They improved on this a bit because in Eternal, power and influence aren't tied together the way mana and color are, they are independent. The influence requirements are minimums that aren't used up like mana of a given color. That is, if you have one Fire influence, you can play any number of cards that require one Fire influence. In MTG, if you only have one source of red mana, that red mana can only be spent for one card at a time.\r\n\r\nFactions\r\n\r\nSpeaking of color/influence, Eternal has five factions like MTG's color pie:\r\n\r\n|Faction|Symbol color|Closest analogous MTG color|\r\n|-----|-----|-----|\r\n|Fire|Red|Red|\r\n|Shadow|Purple|Black|\r\n|Primal|Blue|Blue|\r\n|Justice|Green|White|\r\n|Time|Yellow|Green|\r\n\r\nAs you can see, they don't map cleanly. Often in my own head I still refer to the factions by their MTG analogue (and I call Justice Green and Time White), but I've been improving on this lately. The play styles largely map correctly though. Fire decks are often aggressive with small quick creatures and burn for reach. Primal decks have card draw and counter magic. Shadow decks have a lot of removal and life draining. Time decks have mana acceleration and big creatures. Justice decks have Wrath of God lol.\r\n\r\nKeywords\r\n\r\nAs expected, many of Eternal keywords are similar or analogous to MTG keywords. And they added some fun, unique keywords of their own. Eternal already has a number of expansions out, so there are quite a number of keywords already. Here's a quick list:\r\n\r\n|Keyword|MTG Analogue|Notes|\r\n|-----|-----|-----|\r\n|Aegis|Hexproof|Unlike hexproof, Aegis only works once (it resets if the unit enters play again). Also, Aegis will protect against Wrath-style effects whereas Hexproof does not. I think this is a neat hexproof variant that could also work in MTG, maybe.|\r\n|Berserk|None|This is a fun, unique risk-reward mechanic that has no equivalent in MTG. Basically you can choose to attack twice if a unit has Berserk, one time only. After activating berserk, the unit becomes Reckless. |\r\n|Charge|Haste|\r\n|Deadly|Deathtouch|Deadly + Overwhelm/Quick Draw work exactly the same as MTG's Deathtouch + Trample/First Strike|\r\n|Double Damage|Double Strike|Well, the damage is just doubled, there's no second damage step.|\r\n|Endurance|Vigilance|In addition to not tapping to attack, units with Endurance can't be tapped (exhausted) or stunned by enemy effects|\r\n|Flying|Flying|Big surprise!|\r\n|Killer|Fight|Fight is a close analogue, but there are major differences. A unit with Killer can attack one enemy unit at any time (even with summoning sickness), and the fight is treated as a combat (effects that trigger on attack or block will take place)|\r\n|Lifesteal|Lifelink|\r\n|Overwhelm|Trample|\r\n|Quickdraw|First strike|But only when attacking. No defensive first strike!\r\n|Reckless|Attacks each turn if able|\r\n|Revenge||The first time this unit dies, it gains Destiny (automatically played when drawn) and is shuffled back the top ten cards of your deck|\r\n|Unblockable|Unblockable|\r\n|Warcry|Warcry|This was my favorite when first starting out. Whenever a unit with Warcry attacks, the next unit or weapon in your deck gains an attack/defense buff. Value! This is one of those abilities that can't happen in a paper game like MTG.|\r\n|Scout|Scry\r\n\r\nThese are just the battle skills! Eternal also has a set of trigger keywords that define when an effect will happen. There's Summon and Entomb, analogous to HS's Battlecry and Deathrattle; Empower, Spark and Tribute, are analogous to MTG's Landfall, Bloodthirst and Morbid; and so on. There's far too many to cover here!\r\n\r\nRe: other mechanics, the main one to note is that Eternal takes full advantage of the fact that it's a computer game and doesn't need to deal with player memory issues. This means that buffs and debuffs stay on cards, even when they leave zones. Unlike Hearthstone, the graveyard/void zone exists and thus reanimator strategies are viable. There is some amount of RNG, such as \"units gain a random battle skill\", but not as much as HS. \r\n\r\nA nice mechanic they have is the \"Market\". Basically each deck can have a set of five cards set aside as a \"Market\"/sideboard, and there are a set of cards (one for each faction) that allow you to fetch a card of that faction from the market. Basically similar to the way the Wishes worked in Magic. It's a clever approach that allows for some form of \"sideboarding\" even for best of one matches\r\n\r\nSkill Level, Competitive Play and F2P\r\n\r\nI think Eternal is inherently more skill-based than HS because of:\r\n\r\nmanabase decisions\r\nmuch less RNG\r\nattacking and blocking\r\n\r\nThe meta for competitive play is rather healthy, there are a number of viable decks in different archetypes that can you to Master ranking on the ladder.\r\n\r\nEternal provides several modes for Limited play as well. \r\n\r\nThere's Forge, which is similar to Hearthstone's Arena\r\nThere's monthly sealed leagues\r\nThere's 4-pack draft available at any time\r\n\r\nIn terms of F2P, Eternal is the most generous among CCGs I've tried in terms of how much it gives players for free, as far as I can tell. Aside from the standard three daily quests, your first ranked win of each day gets you a free pack. There's a free Gauntlet mode where you fight against AIs, and just grinding Gauntlet can get you enough gold to purchase the campaigns, which give you more cards to work with. When you start out, you quickly earn starter decks for five factions and five color pairs. These decks are decent enough for ranked play; I remember I took the Rakano and Stonescar starter decks up to Gold rank during my first month. They recently nerfed gold rewards from chests (that you earn from quests) by 10% for balance reasons, but I think the rewards are still pretty generous. \r\n\r\nI hit Master rank in constructed on my third month of play (same rate as with Duelyst I believe) and have regularly hit it ever since. By comparison, I've never hit legend rank in HS. It really helps that Eternal games are quick and a lot more fun.\r\n\r\nIt took me a while longer to hit Master rank in draft - more than one year in fact, I only hit it last week. This was the last achievement I needed for Steam completion too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLore and Aesthetics\r\n\r\nEternal's world is described as \"Six Guns and Sorcery Combined\", which means there's Gunslingers alongside magic users and shamans and such. There's a little bit of steampunk in there too, along with valkyries, yetis, centaurs, wisps, dinosaurs, radiants (basically magical aliens), grenadin (basically goblins), sentinels (basically giant robots), and a bunch of other stuff too.\r\n\r\nIt's pretty fun, and the story is continuously being updated. Each monthly league and the occasional campaign or new card set represents a change in the story. Major characters are represented by powerful cards and often have multiple versions representing their stages of growth. A prime example is Icaria, the young Valkyrie captain who later becomes a rebellious keyword-souped Akroma-like avenger after witnessing her superior's misdeeds:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAside from the lore, I like the game's overall aesthetic. Many game actions have smooth and quick animations that keep the game alive. Units with Aegis are wrapped with an animated bluish glow. Legendary units crash onto the field with force, attacking units dive towards their blockers, and so on. I think the animations and aesthetic are comparable with HS in this regard.\r\n\r\nThe Future\r\n\r\nThe question is now: will I keep playing Eternal now that I've hit my usual target of all the Steam achievements? Or should I focus on MTG Arena for the foreseeable future? (MTG Arena blog post sometime in the next month maybe)\r\n\r\nIt is still pretty fun to play Eternal, and they just came out of Early Access and launched on XBoxOne, so there might be an upsurge in community activity. I think I will play it for a while, the designers seem to know what they're doing, and a new set comes out next month too. \r\n\r\nThere are a few other online CCGs I have accounts for that I haven't really gotten into for some reason or another, maybe I'll try giving them another chance next year. There's Spellweaver (very slow games and kinda boring), Shadowverse (not a fan of the aesthetic and ugh the UI is so messy/cluttered), and Gwent (uh, it's weird). There's Valve's Artifact coming out too, I might try that if reviews are good. So many card games to play!",

It had it all -- the age of exploration, religious conflict, language barriers, duty, honor, love, betrayal, war, sacrifice, samurai, ninjas, guns, cannons, etc and it still influences my thinking to this day.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite quotes from this book:\r\n\r\n Toranaga: \"Tsukku-san says that the Netherlands were vassals of the Spanish king until just a few years ago. Is that true?\"\r\n \r\n Blackthorne: \"Yes.\"\r\n \r\n Toranaga: \"Therefore, the Netherlands – your allies – are in a state of rebellion against their lawful king?\"\r\n \r\n Blackthorne: \"They’re fighting against the Spaniard, yes, but –\r\n \r\n Toranaga: \"Isn’t that rebellion? Yes or no?\"\r\n \r\n Blackthorne: \"Yes. But there are mitigating circumstances. Serious miti- \"\r\n \r\n Toranaga: \"There are no ‘mitigating circumstances’ when it comes to rebellion against a sovereign lord!\"\r\n \r\n Blackthorne: \"Unless you win.\"\r\n \r\n Toranaga looked at him intently. Then laughed uproariously. \"Yes, Mister Foreigner…you have named the one&nbsp;mitigating factor.\"\r\n\r\nI later ended up reading the rest of Clavell's Asian Saga (in fact, I believe I still have most of them on my bookshelf), but none of them stuck with me as much as Shogun. And I just found out there's gonna be a TV adaptation soon! Hope it's good, looking forward to that one. (I know there was an older TV adaptation before starring Richard Chamberlain and Toshiro Mifune, but I'm too lazy to go look for a copy of that.)\r\n\r\n [1]: http://roytang.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/1901150101528380204439121173953250_n1.jpg\r\n [2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TheAsianSaga\r",

I have a few issues with Wordpress, none of them a major dealbreaker, but collectively enough to make me consider something else:\r\n\r\nthe new Gutenberg editor set to become standard in 5.0 was in my experience, very clunky and kinda annoying\r\nthe code structure of Wordpress is very deep and complex, sometimes making it difficult for me to make changes I want. I can usually figure it out, but it feels like things are unnecessarily more complicated than they need to be\r\nWordpress's rich plugin library is a plus, but it also means having to figure out how to have multiple plugins interoperate with each other. An easy example is that I was using a queueing plugin that didn't work great with the Gutenberg editor\r\nWordpress requires a lot of maintenance, including needing to regularly update plugins for security purposes, and comment moderation\r\n\r\n Static Site Generators\r\n\r\nAt the same time, while reading across some blogs over the past few months, I had ran into the idea of static site generators, which intrigued me as a Wordpress alternative. SSGs offered several advantages:\r\n\r\nI could compose my posts offline and using any text editor I wanted, using a simple format like Markdown\r\nPage load performance is better since Apache will simply serve up the static files, no processing or database hits of any kind\r\nStatic sites don't require security updates of any sort - there's no database or admin backend to be hacked\r\nEasy backups. In WP I was using a custom plugin for backups. With an SSG, I can simply have the raw content stored in Github, then the static content \"built\" from there. The content always exists in at least three places - the actual site, Github, and my local computer I use for posting.\r\n\r\nWhy Hugo\r\n\r\nThere's quite a lot of static site generators available right now actually. The most popular one seems to be Jekyll which is ruby-based. I first decided to try Pelican because I preferred Python over Ruby. However, it turned out problematic on my Windows machine, I encountered some interoperability problems with pandoc for the WP migration. I didn't want to have too many dependencies and issues with dependencies because I would later want to deploy the generator itself to my hosting on Webfaction for automated deployments, so I wanted the setup to be as easy as possible.\r\n\r\nThen I stumbled upon Hugo, which offered two main advantages:\r\n\r\nthe MSP was performance. I wanted to migrate over the entire history of the blog, which was almost 900 posts at this point. \r\nno external dependencies - all I needed was to download the hugo executable \r\n\r\nAfter reading up and testing a bit of Hugo, I had a fit of \"I couldn't sleep, I'll just go ahead and do the site migration now\" that I would later regret since it completely screwed up my sleep schedule. \r\n\r\n Wordpress Export\r\n\r\nI used the Wordpress to Hugo plugin to convert my Wordpress content for Hugo. Many posts had reported problems with this plugin, but I didn't have any issues with its basic operation. I had a two problems with it:\r\n\r\nwhen exporting existing Wordpress comments, it didn't include the commenter's URL, which I felt I should include\r\nall the posts were exported into a single posts folder. While this didn't create any permalinks issues due to each post having the url attribute in the frontmatter, it made the entire folder look very unorganized since I had almost 900+ posts. I preferred that the posts be grouped by year and month, matching the /yyyy/mm/slug/ format of the permalink\r\n\r\nSince I had the source for the plugin, it was straightforward to fix both issues myself.\r\n\r\nAfter getting the export from the plugin, I still had a bit of post-processing and cleaning up of the posts to do.\r\n\r\nFor one thing, all the single-quotes in the exported posts seem to have been converted to HTML entities for that smart quote thing, so I had to reverse that. Luckily, it was a simple find and replace across text files. The format for embedding posts such as Twitter, Youtube, etc was different as well, I had to correct those files one by one.\r\n\r\nCleaning up the taxanomies\r\n\r\nI had always wanted to clean up the categories in the blog, but I never got around to it with Wordpress because I didn't feel like figuring out the SQL I would have needed to do it. (I've never liked Wordpress's table structure.). With Hugo, all I had to do was update a bunch of text files, which I was much more comfortable with. This involved simply importing a Python library to parse frontmatter, and a script to do the conversion.\r\n\r\n Generating the archive pages\r\n\r\nHugo doesn't have built-in support for archive pages, so I had to create them myself. I followed the setup described in this blog post and wrote a python script to generate the individual year/month archive pages.\r\n\r\nA bigger problem was the archive listing (the page that would link to the individual archive pages). Because the blog has been running for 15 years, there's a whole lot, so I preferred to organize them in a table like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI actually couldn't find a decent Wordpress plugin that did this for me exactly, so I wrote my own plugin for this.\r\n\r\nFor Hugo, I struggled with this a while and was close to figure out when I finally got the approach right. CHeck my archives page for how it turned out. The upside is I got to become a bit familiar with https://golang.org/, particularly the way content is parsed and processed in Hugo templates.\r\n\r\nCustom shortcodes\r\n\r\nI had some custom-formatted code in Wordpress that wasn't exported properly by the plugin. This required I create some new shortcodes for Hugo and replace the corresponding calls.\r\n\r\nSpoilers. I had only recently added this WP plugin, and only one post was using it so this was straightforward. I created the spoiler shortcode and added some simple jQuery-backed code to toggle the spoiler content. I would have preferred doing this with vanilla JS so as to avoid the jQuery dependency, but I decided to put off learning how to do that for another day.\r\nMTG Decklists and card links. Individual card links wasn't an issue - I just generated an anchor as needed, and had to clean up some of the pages that used it. The decklist part was more challenging, as it involved a lot of text parsing. I managed to get it working to a point where the decklists were formatted correctly, but individual cards weren't linked, before deciding to give up. The main issue is I haven't figured out how to parse each line to split the card count and the card name, if the card count exists, i.e. \"3 Lightning Bolt\". I considered just adding JavaScript to format the contents post-load, but the current behavior will do for now. Maybe I'll even revisit the Hugo parsing issue later.\r\n\r\n Redirects\r\n\r\nI wanted to minimize changes in the URLs of older content, so the permalinks for the old posts were kept in place. Another issue was the RSS feed, generated at /index.xml by Hugo, which I wanted at /feed/ so that feed readers don't need to be updated. A simple redirect in .htaccess was enough to get this done. I'm not much good at regexes, so I had to reference another blog post for this one. The RSS feeds for categories/tags has changed, I think that's fine.\r\n\r\nAutomatic Deployment\r\n\r\nI referenced another blog post for setting up automatic deployment. The main difference was my host was Webfaction while his was Digital Ocean, which did cause me a bit of trouble when I was trying to set up a Github webhook to automatically deploy on every push. It turns out Webfaction doesn't allow me to set an env variable in .htaccess to be read by the PHP script (as was in the blog post linked above). It took me a while to figure out this was the issue, so I just gave up on the Github webhook for now and just set a cron job to periodically pull and redeploy the site. I needed the cron job anyway, if I wanted to support future publishing and possibly some form of queueing later on.\r\n\r\n Comments\r\n\r\nLegacy comments from WP are imported directly into the markdown of each page. Future comments are now handled using Disqus. I already had a Disqus account before, I forgot why I stopped using it. That being said, outsourcing the comments makes a lot of sense. \r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n\r\nwe lose the site search for now. There are some workarounds, including Google SiteSearch (I believe it has ads) or building a JSON index and searching on the client-side (seems impractical given the number of posts). I believe I'm the only one using the site search anyway, I'll revisit this at another time.\r\nthe markdown engine allows raw HTML in the content, but if you have any line breaks in between, your structure breaks, so that required some cleanup\r\n\r\n Theme\r\n\r\nI'm not much of a CSS/site design guy, I'm more a \"find an existing theme and tweak it to your liking\" guy, so I browsed Hugo's available themes for a while and settled on Hyde-Y, which I proceeded to modify a bit, adding a picture to the sidebar and so on. It's simple and clean and straightforward, nothing too fancy. Maybe I'll revisit the theme later.\r\n\r\nFor posterity's sake, a screenshot of the new layout/theme:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nAt the end of it, it turned out a bit more effort than I expected. I'll probably be cleaning up the exported older posts every so often because I'm OC that well. The theming/templating turned out to be a bit more complicated than I expected, but I think it was easier to manage than Wordpress. The last time I tried to use a custom blog engine, I got tired of maintaining and upating it so I switched back to Wordpress, hopefully that doesn't happen here. Not having to maintain a web interface is a pretty good indicator.\r\n\r\nDespite the effort, the great thing is that I did learn a few things, so at the minimum it's already a win:\r\n\r\na bit of GoLang\r\nhow to create Github Webhooks\r\nmore .htaccess stuff\r\nusage of pathlib.Path in Python3 (no more os.glob for me!)\r\n\r\n",

I ran into this one called Sparketypes recently. Here's my result:\r\n\r\n Your Primary Sparketype reveals the essential nature or \"driver\" of the work you're here to do (whether it's the work you get paid to do, or not). When you do the work of your Primary Sparketype, you come alive with purpose and, fully-expressed in a healthy way, deepen into meaning, flow, connection and joy.\r\n \r\n As a Maven, fascination is your call. You latch onto a topic, field or industry and devour everything you can know about it. Staying \"surface level\" just isn't an option for you. It's no fun. You are driven to learn, to discover, to ferret out information, wisdom, knowledge for no other purpose than the joy of learning and knowing something as fully and deeply as you can.\r\n \r\n Your Maven's fascination and yearning to learn might be expressed more generally, as a perpetual curiosity about everything and everyone. Or, it may be more focused on highly-specific topics or fields of interest that evolve over time, often because your ceaseless yearning to learn has largely exhausted what the topic has to offer. So, you find the next area of fascination to move on to.\r\n \r\n For Maven's it's not necessarily about what you \"do\" with your rapidly-accumulating reservoir of wisdom. What you learn may be useful to the others, or not. When it is, you enjoy sharing it. It is a beautiful potential \"by-product\" that also is essential if you want to turn your Maven-ness into your living. But, when you're really being honest, it's not the essential reason you do it. The fact that is has value to others is more a measuring stick of the depth of your knowledge and ability to fully-express what you've learned than a true expression of your reason for being. Either way, the deeper driver is the quest to learn, to satisfy your perpetual, insatiable fascination.\r\n\r\nOh, there's two results! I'm not sure I understand what the difference is. Here's the second one:\r\n\r\n Remember, your Primary Sparketype (above) represents the essential nature of the work you're here to do. Your core driver of purpose, passion, expression and flow in work and life. Your Shadow Sparketype, on the other hand, is also a big part of you. Some may feel its call nearly as strongly. Your Shadow Sparketype most often reveals the work that you may well enjoy and have developed a high level of skill around, BUT it is also largely taken up in service of doing the work of your Primary Sparketype better.\r\n \r\n Your Shadow Sparketype is The Scientist, which means you are driven by, and find a deep sense of satisfaction in the pursuit of an answer to a burning question, or the solution to a significant problem. But, for you, when you're really being honest, that drive is almost always in service of doing the work of your Primary Sparketype at the higher possible level. It's more a means than an end. \r\n\r\nMany times quizzes like these are eerily accurate - which shouldn't be a surprise since you're the one providing the input, so the results will tend to reinforce what your own views are about yourself. I'm especially fond of the assessment of the Maven's tendency to latch onto anything that fascinates him, since that happened to me just recently with learning Hugo and the site migration from Wordpress which I lost sleep over. I think this is one of things that makes me feel most alive - when I find a topic of interest and dive into it and lose sleep over it. Unfortunately, that happens fairly rarely nowadays and rarely lasts very long.\r\nI'm slightly amused by how I've read so much about strategies for monetizing content on the internet that by now I can easily recognize when someone else is doing it. After sending me my Sparketype, there was also a link to a page upselling me on their \"Mastery Program\" which would allow me to make the most of this knowledge for $29.99. I guess it was a book or video of some sort. Exactly 24 hours after the initial results email, I got a 2nd email which was following-up and encouraging me to take a look at the program. I unsubscribed at this point, but I find it safe to assume I'm still in their database. I don't even think I ever signed up. I'm not really the type of person who would pay for these things, so as long as I know what I'm getting into, I don't mind tolerating the sleazy marketing for a bit.",

Took just a little under two weeks from start to Platinum. Maybe mild, unmarked spoilers somewhere in this review, be warned!\r\n\r\nOverall: the game was amazing and spectacular and fun, especially for a big comic book fan like me, well worth the buy.\r\nMechanics: Combat felt a bit weird to me at first, mainly because I was expecting it to be closer to Arkham-style combat, and I kept trying to use Spider-Man's Circle Dodge the same way I use Batman's Triangle counter, and that got me clocked by the first boss of the game (Kingpin) a few times. Spider-man's Dodge doesn't allow you to cancel out of existing animations like Batman's counter, so I really needed to unlearn that instinct. Once you get a hang of it, it's pretty good, but feels a lot more chaotic than Arkham style combat. Arkham combat felt a lot more rhythmic where you just tap commands out and point at the baddie you want to hit. Here it feels like you have to be jumping all the time and swinging across the air and moving the camera around to look for objects to throw at enemies.\r\nMechanics: Web-swinging around Manhattan also felt weird at first. Sometimes the command to web swing would be unresponsive, which I would later realize would be because I was at a height that was too high to find surfaces to swing from. Once you get the hang of it, it feels very smooth and fun and you're zipping around Manhattan like a boss.\r\nStory: Peter Parker in this universe is reminiscent of old-school Peter Parker who's always late to things and always behind on his rent. The early parts have him getting evicted from his apartment (classic Parker!) and looking for a place to crash. (Although after that point, it's never mentioned where he's sleeping, if he is at all.)\r\nStory: Spider-man here is however, a well-known public figure, a veteran of super-heroing who even gets some assistance from law enforcement primarily in the form of Captain Yuri Watanabe. He's been webslinging around long enough to build a stable of villains who are constantly referenced about being held in the Raft.\r\nMechanics: There's actually a lot to do around the city. Not really collectibles, but more like different kinds of challenges and missions. There's a lot of crimes to stop that you'll hear on police bands as you're web-swinging around. More difficult crimes and missions unlock as the story progresses, and they all come with optional objectives (such as perform X type of special move, etc) that give you bonus rewards. There's also stealth missions reminiscent of Arkham's predator modes, pigeon chasing, research missions that have you doing all sorts of weird tasks, and so on. Missions typically reward you with some form of tokens, which are used to unlock suits, gadgets and upgrades. This Spider-Man has a lot of gadgets, making him closer to a Batman figure in this universe. \r\nStory: In this universe, J. Jonah Jameson is retired from his days at the Daily Bugle and instead hosts an internet radio show where as can be expected, he's always castigating Spider-Man. His broadcasts come in as you're swinging around the city, and Jonah will often comment on things you've recently done or missions recently accomplished. I especially like it when one of the missions had you doing something ridiculous like intentionally swinging through smog and Jonah makes wild speculations about what the hell you were smoking.\r\nMechanics: The suit selection in the game is fairly good, there's a lot of suits available and you unlock more as you level up (you need to purchase them with tokens). You can change costumes at any time, and most cutscenes will show Spider-Man wearing whatever suit you have on at the time, which can be sometimes hilarious. I'm severaly disappointed at the lack of the Fantastic Four Amazing Bag-Man costume though. My favorite costume from this game is the classic comic book costume (screenshots below), I really like how well it's animated so smoothly and gives such a cartoony vibe. I would totally play an entire game rendered in this fashion. It's also hilarious when this costume is used in cutscenes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMystery: I'm not sure why, but the distance scaling in this game is super-off. In-game measurements tell me Manhattan island is about 4 km from top to bottom, which feels really small. The Wikipedia entry says Manhattan is almost 60 sq km, but in-game it can't be more than 10 sq km. I'm not sure why it would be like this.\r\nStory/Mechanics: You don't get to play as Peter Parker/Spider-Man all the time, there's also a few missions you have to play out as one of two side characters. One of them is the lovable spunky red-headed Mary Jane Watson, who in this universe is not a supermodel actress, but rather has a more Lois-Lane like role as an investigative reported for the Daily Bugle. That means she gets herself into all sorts of troublesome situations where she has to sneak around enemies in order to escape. She's no damsel in distress here, I'm not even sure if Peter ever rescues her directly. I like this MJ iteration, she has a lot more spunk. The other side character you get to play at is young Miles Morales, who enter's Peter's life somewhere in the 2nd act of the story. Miles parts consist of sneaking around as well, although he has a different toolset than MJ, mainly consisting of a hacking app that lets him create distractions to bypass guards.\r\nStory: One of the best things in this game's story is the mentorship relationship between Peter Parker and Otto Octavius, although if you know comics, you have a pretty good idea of where this is headed. Unlike the 2nd Tobey movie, the game gives their relationship sufficient time to develop before you start to see signs of trouble. The fall itself is well-executed and heavily foreshadowed and Peter has only himself to blame when he finds out he helped turn his mentor into an insane mechanical octopus.\r\nStory: The overall story had some twists and some surprises in the ending itself. At the heart of all the problems facing Spider-Man this time around is the incumbent Mayor Norman Osborn, but who never actually turns into a green villain himself. The game's ending heavily hints at a 2nd outing, so they're probably saving Norman for later. Wise decision as well, Spider-Man has a deep bench of villains to pull from, and many of the classic ones haven't been hinted at yet in this game. Aside from the Goblin, the 2nd game could very well introduce us to the Lizard, Sandman, Mysterio, and maybe even Venom among others!\r\nAfter getting the platinum, I was tempted to purchase the \"City That Never Sleeps\" DLCs as well for additional content, but I decided to hold off for now. My experience already feels \"complete\" and just right anyway, and adding more missions might be too repetitive. Maybe if it goes on sale sometime.\r\nStan Lee (RIP) also had a small cameo in this game. For me it's bittersweet that I got the platinum a couple of days after his death; I consider the game to be a fitting tribute to his life's work.\r\n \r\nAs is tradition, here's a screendump, awash with in-game spoilers! (Mainly because I chose to include the automatic screenshots that came with each Trophy unlock). You can see during the later parts I was using the comic costume almost exclusively!\r\nblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/GXG9Qb5\"a href=\"//imgur.com/GXG9Qb5\"/a/blockquotescript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"/script",

Today, in the face of a world where hatemongers and the intolerant are able to use modern communication technologies to more easily spread their views, I realize that things may not be so black and white. Like so many beliefs I held when I was young, I now find myself of the opinion that instead of absolute tolerance (which may not even be possible), there is some semblance of intolerance that may be needed to keep to the ideal.  \r\n\r\n\r\nEnter Karl Popper&#8217;s Paradox of Tolerance:figure class=\"wp-block-image\"\r\n\r\n/figure \r\n\r\nOr if you want to read his actual text from The Open Society and Its Enemies:\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\r\n  p\r\n    \"Unlimited tolerance must lead to the disappearance of tolerance. If we extend unlimited tolerance even to those who are intolerant, if we are not prepared to defend a tolerant society against the onslaught of the intolerant, then the tolerant will be destroyed, and tolerance with them. In this formulation, I do not imply, for instance, that we should always suppress the utterance of intolerant philosophies; as long as we can counter them by rational argument and keep them in check by public opinion, suppression would certainly be most unwise. But we should claim the right to suppress them if necessary even by force; for it may easily turn out that they are not prepared to meet us on the level of rational argument, but begin by denouncing all argument; they may forbid their followers to listen to rational argument, because it is deceptive, and teach them to answer arguments by the use of their fists or pistols. We should therefore claim, in the name of tolerance, the right not to tolerate the intolerant. We should claim that any movement preaching intolerance places itself outside the law, and we should consider incitement to intolerance and persecution as criminal, in the same way as we should consider incitement to murder, or to kidnapping, or to the revival of the slave trade, as criminal.\"\r\n  /p\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nAnother article about it that I like is this Medium post titled Tolerance is not a Moral Precept. From this post:\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\r\n  p\r\n    br /strongTolerance is not a moral absolute; it is a peace treaty./strongTolerance is a social norm because it allows different people to live side-by-side without being at each other’s throats. It means that we accept that people may be different from us, in their customs, in their behavior, in their dress, in their sex lives, and that if this doesn’t directly affect our lives, it is none of our business. But the model of a peace treaty differs from the model of a moral precept in one simple way: the protection of a peace treaty only extends to those willing to abide by its terms. It is an agreement to live in peace, emnot/em an agreement to be peaceful no matter the conduct of others. A peace treaty is not a suicide pact.\r\n  /p\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nYet another essay, the work Nassim Taleb (author of The Black Swan), asserts that intolerant minorities can easily take over a majority, if not controlled. \r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\r\n  p\r\n    br /We can answer these points using the minority rule. Yes, an intolerant minority can control and destroy democracy. Actually, as we saw, it emwill/em eventually destroy our world.\r\n  /p\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nPopper still advocates maximum tolerance as long as the intolerant can be held in check, but he assumes there is a limit beyond which such is no longer viable. Society will need to find the proper balance.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://preview.redd.it/uedawtfzqbgz.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=fd2456eb7ee01f3eef7db8bb7adf91e7076e988a\r\n [2]: https://extranewsfeed.com/tolerance-is-not-a-moral-precept-1af7007d6376\r",

For context: in the story, one of the characters has a special talent that he can shoe anything anyone gives him (like when you put horseshoes on a horse). And Granny Weatherwax tells him that the price he pays for that talent is that when someone brings him something to shoe, no matter how wild or ridiculous the request, he has to do it.\r\n\r\nIn real life of course, the literal interpretation is ridiculous. You are not obligated to do something just because you are the \"best\" at that something. But being the \"best\" at something implies two things:\r\n\r\nPeople are more inclined to come to you whenever they need help or advice with what you're best at.\r\nIf you want to keep being the \"best\" at that thing, you have to keep doing it, and you have to keep surpassing yourself.\r\n\r\nI have a variant of this quote that I used a lot in a previous job, where people often came to me with their technical problems and asked me for help in solving them, so a lot of my time was taken up by helping solve other people's problems. I would jokingly complain \"Ang hirap talaga maging magaling!\" It's hard being so good! - implying that being magaling gave me so much additional work. \r\n\r\nOnce you put yourself in a position of leadership in your field, there will be pressure to maintain that position by constantly improving and learning and showing your skills by helping other people. Humility disclaimer: I'm not claiming to be the best software developer by any stretch, it was probably more of a big fish in a small pond scenario. But the quote above is a reminder for me that pursuing excellence has a price often unmentioned, and you have to be sure you are willing to pay that price, and that it's worth it for you.",

Examples include:\r\n\r\n  we are almost certainly too late to prevent climate change at all and social collapse is now an actual possibility\r\n  Trump has begun taking steps to walk back a nuclear arms control treaty\r\n  increasing trends of nationalism and populism threatening to walk back the gains of globalisation (i.e. Brexit) and diversity\r\n  Elon Musk warns us of the existential threat of artificial intelligence  \r\n    \r\n  locally, some friends of mine are largely pessimistic about the future of Philippine society as it seems that we are falling further into the trap of autocratic leanings and dynasty-driven patronage\r\n\r\nI wonder if things are looking so bad because we are coming from a period of relative peace and expansion of liberal democracy the past few decades (not saying things are perfect, but at least we haven't gotten into any world wars recently). Maybe some of the societal and cultural problems highlighted above may be nothing more than society trying to find a new equilibrium in an age of political correctness and social justice. Climate change is of course, a game changing problem that we as a society seem to be unable to face or control.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nI like to think of myself as an optimist, but even I am increasingly wary of where our world and my country are heading. I am slightly comforted by the words of an American novelist, which I heard from the recent season of Daredevil:  \r\n\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"\r\n  p\r\n    \"Life is to be lived, not controlled; and humanity is won by continuing to play in face of certain defeat.\"\r\n  /p\r\n  \r\n  cite-- Ralph Ellison/cite\r\n/blockquote\r\n\r\nWe have to hold out hope that humanity and society can adapt and survive these crises, that we have not come all this way simply to lose to our own hubris.\r\n\r\n [1]: https://www.minnpost.com/earth-journal/2018/10/new-outlook-on-global-warming-best-prepare-for-social-collapse-and-soon/?fbclid=IwAR2OR1lTChzd3eAnEl9nnlCpgDr9GhvUKxNrCd5JNXShQK9Uj8EMCbKPvhM\r",

I've commented quite a few times on Reddit threads regarding this over the years, here's my favorite one:\r\n\r\n What if they didn't bundle DLC separately and just straight-up sold the game for a higher price (and with a slightly later release date), would you prefer it? Or if the game was released with the same price but no additional DLC at all? Or the game is released with no DLC but six months later a new full version of the game is released with slightly more content that could have been released as DLC but instead you now have to buy a full game again?\r\n \r\n Personally, I find that DLC is a good idea as it allows customers to pick and choose which content they want. I'm not going to bitch about it, I don't have to buy the DLC if I don't want to. In fact for longer games like RPGs I just wait for the GOTY to come out later.\r\n \r\n Also, the phrase \"cutting content out of the game\" shows misunderstanding of how software development in general works. Like all other software development gigs, game development is largely constrained by schedules and real-world budget and resource constraints. And most of the time they're going to fall short of those schedules and have to decide what features to cut so they can make it on time. Having the option of releasing them as DLC creates less pressure on the team and creates an opportunity for content that would otherwise have been cut or saved for a larger expansion disc to be made available. And please don't take at face value the rantings that because 90% of a DLC's content is already on the disc that it should have been included at release - you haven't considered the other 90% yet.\r\n\r\nOne of the other complaints is that with DLC being available on launch or shortly thereafter, it doesn't feel like one is getting the \"complete\" experience for a game purchased at full price. I finished the PS4 Spider-Man game recently and got the platinum even, and I'm super happy with the game, got what pretty much felt like a complete experience. At the time I played the game there were already two DLC packs available, one featuring the Black Cat and another featuring Tombstone. When I finished the game, I thought about buying the DLCs since I enjoyed the game so much, but in the end I decided to hold off since neither of those felt like they were necessary. Worrying that you're missing out on the \"complete experience\" is just another form of FOMO.\r\n\r\nI also absolutely respect the gaming companies' right to determine their own business model and what price points and what DLCs they choose to offer. People complain about low-value DLC like additional weapons or map packs for $10 or such. The decision to release such DLC is a business decision, and like all business decisions, they can really only be influenced with your wallet. You don't have to pay for poor value DLC! Companies can try to nickel and dime you for content, that's their choice. It's your choice to walk away.\r\n\r\nOn a side note, in my opinion the worst DLC offenders are multiplayer games (usually from companies like EA or Ubisoft). Maybe my opinion is helped by the fact that I'm largely a single-player gamer. There is very little problematic DLC with games like The Witcher 3 (I haven't played either of the expansions!) or Persona 5 for example. Also, even before DLCs were a thing, I had already been playing Magic the Gathering. Hohoho TCGs are like the epitome of DLCs, you literally have to pay money just to complete a deck! (Luckily modern online CCGs often provide viable F2P options).\r\n\r\nI kind of like the DLC model for games where companies constantly release DLC for a game even years after their release, it increases the gameplay lifetime. As long as you can enjoy the game without the DLC of course.\r\n\r\nSome specific games with DLC that I have purchased:\r\n\r\nStreet Fighter V. Fighting games these days have a lot of DLC, usually either cosmetics (costumes) or new characters. For the PS4 version, I only used in-game cash to get new characters, but I also got the Steam version and just got a couple of Season passes there. I usually don't bother with cosmetics, but I did get one costume DLC for SFV, and that's because I thought it was absolutely criminal not to have Cody's prison garb. \r\nStellaris DLC has been pretty good too. I recently bought my first DLC for Stellaris, and I find the additional content acceptable. Paradox is great at long term support for their strategy games. I look forward to occasionally buying a DLC pack once a year or so and playing the game for a month before abandoning it again lol.\r\nCivilization. For Civ5 and Civ6, I usually bought any DLCs that introduced additional civs, as I like the variance in my games. This seems of questionable value since I'll typically play each new Civ only once or twice, but the DLC packs are usually cheap enough for me not to worry about it.\r\n\r\nIn summary: I think DLC in general is a good if not positive trend for gaming, since it gives the consumer additional choices. It also keeps game prices comparatively low while facilitating additional income sources for the developers. And we as gamers always have the freedom not to indulge companies that release bad DLC.",

One level is the rational, conscious mind. The mind is the part that considers all the options, weighs the pros and cons, and compares the metrics against your personal goals. The second level is subconscious and instinctive, sometimes called the human heart (not to be confused with the organ that pumps blood). The heart makes decisions using instincts and biases honed from your own life experiences and baser needs such as fear, anger, or self-preservation.\r\n\r\nWhen you find yourself hesitating or unsure or conflicted about a particular decision, more often than not the reason is because your heart and mind are at odds. Your rational mind weighs all the factors and comes to a decision, but your heart has also made a decision and they disagree. Moving past your hestiation means giving more weight to one or the other. It will often be better to find a way to resolve those differences instead. This means asking your mind to probe into your heart's concerns. Sometimes the rational mind will be able to use reason to allay the instinctive fears of the heart. Sometimes the subconsious heart will be able to identify something that the conscious mind has overlooked. \r\n\r\nWhen heart and mind are one, this is no guarantee that it will be the correct decision (neither side can see into the future after all), but you can make the decision without regret knowing your full self has approved of it.",

Sometimes even minor version differences can cause issues in running your software. I have two example stories to share:\r\n\r\n  One of our clients asked us for help with an upgrade their production servers from CentOS 6.4 to 6.9. It was supposed to be a straightforward yum upgrade, which meant of course there would be a problem. The problem turned out to be one of the SOAP calls to a third-party service. After a bunch of retries and log checking, we found that OpenSSL was complaining that the third party&#8217;s certificate didn&#8217;t have enough bits in the Diffie-Hellman (DH) parameters. Complaining to the third party would have taken forever, so we had to find a workaround ourselves. I had previously been told that OpenSSL was the same version before and after the upgrade, but after we did our own checking, we found that there was a minor version difference. That led to a lot of searching until I managed to find release notes from Red Hat (which was upstream of CentOS). The release notes linked us to this bug which gave us the workaround we needed.\r\n  I had been working on a Python script that would fetch JSON from an external URL and process it. Local dev environment was running Python 3.6. Everything worked well. When I went to deploy it to my server, I found that my host only supported Python 3.5. I was like surely there wouldn&#8217;t be a problem, so of course there was. It turns out the json load functions added support for binary inputs in 3.6, which I had been using all this time. I ended up using a codecs workaround from this Stackoverflow post which happened to work well in both versions.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n [1]: https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHBA-2017:0660\r\n [2]: https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1335921\r\n [3]: https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.6.html#json\r",

The first one is Hidden Figures, about three black women who were instrumental during the early days of NASA leading up to the Friendship 7 mission piloted by John Glenn. The movie is fairly interesting if you are even remotely interested in either the challenges faced in black history or math and science or the early days of the space program competition between the USA and Russia. It feels even more appropriate to have watched this since it helps me appreciate the recent Insight mission. (The Oatmeal has a fun preview of this event.)\r\n\r\nThe second biopic was Bohemian Rhapsody. This was a magnificent film, both for the music and the Freddie Mercury story. I guess it appeals more to those who are familiar with Queen music though. I've read that the movie isn't super accurate especially with regards to the timeline, but I think it's fine. Both the liberties they take and the music serve to construct a compelling narrative. The movie ends with a ten-minute recreation of the 1985 Live Aid concert and they do a good job of communicating the insane energy at Wembley Stadium back then.\r\n\r\nIn less-biographical movies, I also watched Teen Titans Go To The Movies. I'm not a fan of Teen Titans Go, it's way too silly and it's obviously for kids, I much preferred the previous Teen Titans series. I only got a copy of this movie because my niece said they watched this all the time back home, so now they can watch it when they're over here either. I did enjoy the ridiculous plot and the Stan Lee cameo, but this isn't something I would have watched in the theatre.\r\n\r\nIn rewatch land, since I finished the Spider-Man PS4 game lately, I also watched Spider-Man 2, Spider-Man 3, and Amazing Spider-Man, they're nice movies to have playing in the background while you're working on other stuff. Tobey 2 was pretty good and I think it aged well, I'd say comparable with Tobey 1 even. Tobey 3 was trying to do way too much what with Venom and Sandman and Harry-Goblin. Andrew 1 had a lot of potential, but I think this series leaned too much into the dark and mysterious and sinister plot route.\r\n\r\nTV-wise, nothing much other than the usual superhero series, though I'm still behind on Gifted and Doctor Who. I caught Trevor Noah's new Netflix special, it was okay, but too exceptionally. Netflix also added a couple of \"best of\" seasons of Jeopardy which I thoroughly enjoyed. Watching these makes me think I'd never be able to win an episode of Jeopardy, but of course I don't think it's fair to compare myself to some of Jeopardy's all-time champions.",

Many times she would be putting in extra hours for days at a time and I would say to her \"Put that off until tomorrow, it's time to go home.\" and she would reply along the lines of \"But I still have so much work to do.\" and my usual rejoinder would be \"Are you expecting to finish all of that work tonight?\"\r\n\r\nThe modern working world is full of problems, issues, tasks and other work that needs to be resolved, and it can be overwhelming at times. It can seem like the list of to-dos is endless. Software development in particular can seem like never-ending crises and issues and tickets to be resolved, especially for larger teams and larger projects. But that shouldn't mean we sacrifice all our time in pursuit of emptying that to-do list. We put in our hours and pare down that list the best we can.\r\n\r\nOne learns this quickly when faced with any nontrivial project with an issue tracker. Often the list will seem to keep growing with no signs of slowing down. You might have a tendency to say \"but we can't release software with this many issues!\" But deadlines are real, and you learn that you have to triage and make trade-offs with the time you have available. Real-world software is released with issues still pending, simply because there isn't enough time to do everything. So you prioritize and choose the most important things, the most critical bugs, and fix what you can in the available time.\r\n\r\nOne has to apply this to one's personal workload as well. No matter how many things you have to do, you don't have infinite time. You have to figure out what's important for you and that's where you focus your time and effort. Pushing yourself beyond what your time and health allow will do no good. That way lies madness.\r\n\r\nEven for personal goals this is an issue for me. I want to do a lot of things. There are so many things I want to read, write, create, draw, learn, watch, and try out. I want to do everything. There are so many things I want to have mastery over. Mastery implies regularly spending hours on practice and effort. But there are only so many hours in the day.",

Fun story, the CEO of a company once told me they would add more developers to a delayed project to meet the deadline and when I pointed out the increased overhead he said to me that it wasn't a problem because they would just assign modules to those devs that have minimal dependencies so they don't have to communicate so much. Ha! I just shrugged and let him think it was a good idea.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, it's never a good idea, especially late in the game. Even if you are somehow able to minimize any domain overhead (which I seriously doubt), there is also the nontrivial matter of technical overhead that any new developer intake needs to go through. I'm not just talking about learning the programming language or the technical stack - presumably if you are adding someone to the team, he is either already familiar with the stack or you have factored in his being a newbie and needing training time. \r\n\r\nNo, I'm talking about things like templates, UI standards, coding standards, devops processes, configuration, libraries in use, data dictionaries, and so on. Most projects will have \"preferred ways of doing things\", and the more work that has been done on the project, the more such \"tribal knowledge\" is often undocumented and you will need to bother someone to figure the stuff out. And if the project is behind schedule and everyone is trying to catch up, it's more likely people are going to forget to tell you stuff.\r\n\r\nSlightly related side note: If there is very little in the way of standards or tribal knowledge global to the project, that might be a warning sign. I once worked with a client who had several subcontractors to work on the different modules in their system. Each module/subcontractor worked more or less independently from the others, with very little documentation or standards in place. The result was a weird hodgepodge system where one module did things one way, and the next module did things a completely different way, and so on. \r\n\r\nAs an example, I was once asked to help in a project with a relatively large codebase and significant deadline pressure and I was coming in hot with no knowledge of the domain and minimal experience with the framework in use. I told them I wasn't sure I could hit the target given I had to learn a bunch of stuff, but they were in desperate need and so ok we proceeded anyway. Now, I'm an experienced developer, so pulling me in was a better option than pulling in some newbie since there's a lot of stuff I can figure out myself, but off the top of my head, I had to explicitly bother other people about:\r\n\r\nproper access rights to the repo\r\nproper access rights to the google drive with all the documents\r\nCRLF problems when I use windows to clone the repo\r\ndatabase credentials for the provided dev VM\r\nerrors encountered due to undocumented steps missing from the setup document\r\nwhere should I put new configuration options\r\nwhere should I put my new module in the menu\r\nhow to map data in other tables to my new tables\r\nthe proper HTML markup and CSS classes needed to conform to the way they layouted pages\r\nhow to implement form validations the same way as other screens\r\nstandard methods for displaying messages/errors\r\nhow to setup role permissions for my new screens\r\npreferred library for making third party API calls\r\nJS errors encountered when using a particular component\r\nproblems with dynamically created reccords not behaving properly when the page redirects on error\r\n\r\n... and probably a lot more I'm unable to recall anymore, and that's not accounting for any comments that would be later logged by QA because I was unfamiliar with how other screens usually behaved.\r\n\r\nIf you're adding developers to a late project, you have to account for these onboarding costs, in addition to the increased communication overhead. That means sounding the alarm and asking for help earlier. If there's a module that's estimated by your devs to take say, one sprint, you can't ask for help one sprint before the needed delivery - you need to look for help maybe one or two sprints earlier. (Of course, the best approach would be to avoid painting your project into this corner at all, but as we all know in this industry, sometimes things just happen!)",

My PC gaming career (such as it is) started way back in the MS-DOS era. It was an interesting time to be a gamer, to say the least. It was a time when you had to make bootdisks and fiddle around with files like autoexec.bat and himem.sys to make sure your PC booted with the correct configuration required to run your game. I got to become familiar with things like VGA drivers and sound drivers and so on.\r\n\r\nI think we had our first PC in the household around '92 or '93, while I was in high school. I have this vague recollection of using some text from the first Civilization game) in one of my Social Science reports. Pretty sure Civ 1, as I'm still playing the series to this day. I played a lot of the first Civ game, enough to be able to master the highest difficulty level and (with sufficient save scumming), conquer the world with Chariots before Christ is born. The first Civ game was also my first experience at \"hacking\" a game so to speak, since many of the configuration options were read from plain text files on the disk. Even the Civilopedia entries came from text files, so I was able to copy them out to use in my report as mentioned above.\r\n\r\nAnother mainstay of my early PC gaming years was LucasArts-style adventure games. I think my first exposure to these games was during a high school party back in maybe '93 or '94. The host had a copy of Maniac Mansion on his PC, and I spent some time playing that before getting stuck at the big door at the top of the stairs because the host had lost the copy protection disk. Within the next year, I had played the sequel game Day of the Tentacle (to this day I am unsure if I ever finished the first Maniac Mansion though) and the similar Monkey Island games. I must admit that I had a lot more patience then, as these days I haven't gotten far with the current crop of Telltale-led adventure games and the endless trial and error that inevitably arises when you get stuck. (I've been stuck on Broken Age on PS4 for maybe a year now, I should get that done).\r\n\r\nOne of the earlist dungeon crawlers my brother and I played was the horror game Waxworks). This was a single player game, but I say \"my brother and I\" because we were often too scared to play the game alone. The sharp 90 degree turns meant enemies could jump out of nowhere. I'm sure if I played it now I would feel silly, but back then I remember we had tried playing the game at night while the parentals were out, and some baddie jumped out at us in the pyramid level and we went afk at the jump scare and ran out to the nearby sari-sari store. After typing this paragraph, I decided to try running the old copy of Waxworks I still had (you can run old games using DOSBox) and it reminded me that the game had very creepy midi music! Probably contributed a lot to the atmosphere. I don't play horror games anymore nowadays lol.\r\n\r\n{{ figure src=\"/uploads/2018/waxworks.png\" caption=\"The pyramid level was the one we were most familiar with, since it was the first one available.\" }}\r\n\r\nAnother early favorite were the Romance of the Three Kingdoms games#Listofgamesinthe_series) by Koei. I remember playing RTK2 a little bit, but it was RTK3 that we generally spent a lot of time in (we = me and my brothers and some HS friends). I spent so much time on this game, I could finish the game from a single province in the final scenario (where your opponents were 3 large empires). One of our favorite features in RTK3 was the fact that there was a custom character creator. We had a copy of the game that we passed around with a whole bunch of custom characters named after our HS friends. My brother was a big fan of this feature too, he added a bunch of high-stat custom characters named after himself. Sadly, my only remaining copy of this game only has my brother's custom characters and not the ones me and my HS friends made.\r\n\r\n{{ figure src=\"/uploads/2018/rtk3kerwins.jpg\" caption=\"He really liked naming characters after himself. Also I only noticed now the poor grammar i.e. 'a officer'\" }}\r\n\r\nPrior to getting a PC, my video game exposure had been on the Atari and the Nintendo, which meant primarily real-time action-based games. My exposure to PC gaming introduced me to slower, more cerebral and more strategic games, a lifelong hobby that I've enjoyed ever since. What were your early days of PC gaming like?",

While the regularity and the tracking are fairly recent, I'm actually not that much of a stranger to walking as an activity. Even back when I was in high school I would often walk all the way home instead of taking the bus-and-jeep commute route I was supposed to take. It didn't take that much longer, and I often enjoyed the solace (and I got to save a bit of money, even as a child I was quite frugal~). In college, I would regularly walk the couple of kilometers between classes, or from the campus itself to Philcoa. Sometimes, when it was especially hard to commute, I would walk through UP/Teacher's/Sikatuna Village all the way back to our old home in Kamias. I remember doing this once during the aftermath of a terrible storm when there were no jeeps around to take me home.\r\n\r\nEven back then, walking for me was kinda therapeutic. Like I said, I enjoyed the solace. I would often stop at some places and just be at peace for a while. I wrote about this once in an old facebook post:\r\n\r\n There's a place at the corner of East Avenue and BIR Road in Quezon City. When I was young I would walk to that intersection and wait there to catch a jeepney ride that would take me home. It was often easy to get a ride, no more than a couple of minutes wait. But sometimes I wouldn't flag down a jeep immediately. I would sit there at the base of the lamp post at the corner of East Avenue and BIR Road, and let the noise of the world wash over me for some time. I don't remember contemplating anything specific while I was there or whether I had worries or was sad. I would just sit there and be peaceful and the world would move around me and I would watch the people and the cars pass by and wonder who they were or where they were going. After a while the trance would break, and I would fall back into the real world and tell myself I had to get home.\r\n\r\nAlso, a side note, checking Google Maps now, that route's distance was a measly 3.7km, a couple of km shorter than my average walking routes these days. Back then it felt like I was walking a lot!\r\n\r\nWhen I started working in Ortigas, there wasn't much opportunity for regular walking. I almost always walked the short distance from the office to Megamall, unless it was raining or insanely hot. When traffic was really bad and it was difficult to get a bus ride or a taxi, I sometimes took the opportunity to walk from Ortigas to Cubao, or vice versa (Distance: somewhere around 5-6km). I often said to myself that someday I would walk the whole 13 or so km home, but I never did get that chance. Occasionally I would get deployed to another country for work, and when I did one of the things I would do during my nights there would be to walk around a lot. \r\n\r\nThese days, as I've mentioned in the other post, I intentionally try to find the time to walk. I don't always find it, but I do most of the time. It's an additional way to burn off stress. When I'm feeling angry or frustrated or sad (usually about work-related things), I say to myself, it's time for a walk. And it helps me think. My mind wanders as I walk, coming up with ideas or solutions to problems or unlocking new thoughts or awakening slumbering areas of my brain or just overall improving my creativity. Walking is also a way of being in the present, leaving behind your worries and anxieties and simply taking in the world. I intentionally don't pace myself too quickly lest the walk end too soon, although I am often impatient to get back home. I find walking is quite good for developing patience as well. \r\n\r\nThe philosopher Henry David Thoreau said of walking:\r\n\r\n “I think that I cannot preserve my health and spirits, unless I spend four hours a day at least—and it is commonly more than that—sauntering through the woods and over the hills and fields, absolutely free from all worldly engagements. You may safely say, A penny for your thoughts, or a thousand pounds. When sometimes I am reminded that the mechanics and shopkeepers stay in their shops not only all the forenoon, but all the afternoon too, sitting with crossed legs, so many of them—as if the legs were made to sit upon, and not to stand or walk upon—I think that they deserve some credit for not having all committed suicide long ago.\" \r\n\r\nFour hours a day seems excessive of course. I have other things to do. And unlike Thoreau, I don't have the benefit of having nearby woods or hills or fields to saunter through. Mine is more of an urban jungle. But I'm not much of a naturalist anyway (biology was always my weakest science), and I find there is still much to see as I walk through Metro Manila's uneven streets. People rushing by. Small businesses I hadn't noticed before. A large franchise restaurant that's often empty. A couple quietly holding hands in the dusk. Too many politicians' posters. The endless traffic. One time a biker almost got run over by a car. He managed to jump off the bike and landed right beside me on the sidewalk. Sometimes I feel I'm not observant enough, I should take more opportunity during these walks to observe more things.\r\n\r\nSide note: another extra benefit of all this walking is that my sense of distance has improved. I now generally have a sense of roughly how far a kilometer is. This is why I was able to recognize that Manhattan can't be 4km from top to bottom in my Spider-Man PS4 review. I walk more than that distance daily!\r\n\r\nAs you can see, there are many benefits to walking. So, what are you waiting for? Go take a walk!",

Starting 2010, my blogging activity started to taper off, with less than 60 posts until 2015. I tried to revive the habit around mid-2016, posting at least once a week, but the writing slowed down again around April this year (coinciding with one of the more busy periods for me work-wise). Starting in October I had a bit more free time so I decided to fire on all cylinders again. Instead of the previous 1-2 posts per week I was going for in 2016, this time I would go for posting every day. Not even every weekday, but seven days a week.\r\n\r\nI tried this, as an experiment, back in October of 2006, but I didn't last the month with the habit (though I did continue to post regularly for the next few years). \r\n\r\nThis is kind of secondhand-blog-linking, but the post [Seth Godin Explains Why You Should Blog Daily] (https://www.cjchilvers.com/blog/seth-godin-explains-why-you-should-blog-daily) explains well the advantages of posting daily:\r\n\r\n \"Everyone should write a blog, every day, even if no one reads it. There’s countless reasons why it’s a good idea and I can’t think of one reason it’s a bad idea.\"\r\n \r\n \"If you know you have to write a blog post tomorrow, something in writing, something that will be around 6 months from now, about something in the world, you will start looking for something in the world to to write about. You will seek to notice something interesting and to say something creative about it. Well, isn’t that all we’re looking for? The best practice of generously sharing what you notice about the world is exactly the antidote for your fear.\"\r\n \r\n - Seth Godin\r\n\r\nThe first fear of course, is: do I actually have enough material, enough stuff to write about on a daily basis? The article above mentions that the mere act of committing to daily writing means you will naturally tend towards notcing more things and having more opinions and thus more things to write about. But I was skeptical, since I had tried the regular writing before and it didn't really stick. One thing that helped however was that since 2016 I've been regularly listing down blog post ideas. I got this idea from James Altucher's post about becoming an idea machine where he recommend's thinking of 10 ideas daily. I did start out writing 10 blog post ideas every day, but that tapered off after a while because I was only posting a couple of times I week, I had far too many ideas!\r\n\r\nNot all of those ideas would be good enough to be posts of course. I wrote up a few posts first, creating a buffer of posts that could be scheduled in advance. I started posting daily on the second week of October, and have kept it up since, I'm at more than 60 posts now, so the habit has already stuck longer than the last attempt. I find that between the long list of post ideas I already had (some 600+ in total), my daily walks and the fact that I'm a voracious internet reader, it was actually quite easy to maintain a continuous stream of posts to write. \r\n\r\nI don't spend too much time on each post, maybe 30 minutes at most, sometimes much less. On a good day I can knock off up to five posts. I find that most of my recent posts clock in under 1,000 words, which I think is perfectly reasonable. I think my increased participation in internet debates back during the 2016 election period also made me more willing to post opinions online.\r\n\r\nIf you're writing to become a \"professional blogger\" of some sort, or otherwise trying to optimize for engagement or such, daily posting might not be such a good idea. The front page of this blog changes every day, and I don't have a search function at the moment, so it's not straightforward to find something you miss.\r\n\r\nI of course write mostly for myself, though I do appreciate it when I find out people are reading the blog. I prefer posts that I can look back to in a few years to remember what was going on with me at the time. I try to write about things I'm doing, shows I'm watching, projects I'm trying out, games I'm playing, opinions on current events, and generally random thoughts going through my head and so on. I find that the daily writing, like the daily walking, helps improve my thinking processes. And it often encourages me to be a bit more experimental - I can try things out and even if I fail, the floor is that I have a story for a blog post. There is also less pressure for new posts to be super deep or meaningful or otherwise with my daily blogging, there is no room for perfectionism to get in the way.\r\n\r\nI don't know how long I can keep this up on a daily basis. I'll try to revisit this after a year maybe to see how far I've gone.",

Since late 2014, I've been using Duolingo to teach myself new languages. Learning a new language not only helps when you're travelling, but it unlocks different ways of forming thoughts in your brain, helping cognitive development (I may have made up that last part with absolutely no basis except my own speculation.)\r\n\r\nThe first language I tried to study using Duolingo was Spanish, mainly because back then we had an upcoming trip to Europe (including Barcelona) planned in 2015 so the Spanish would have helped. The Philippines also has a lot of history with the Spanish, so there's a lot of words I could pick up easily. I figured there's no reason to make things too difficult right?\r\n\r\nI didn't finish the course before our trip, there was far too much content! At some point during the following year (2016), I did manage to complete all of the available Spanish courses though, so yay! The most challenging part was understanding the use of reflexive pronouns like te or me, since using them changed the structure of sentences. I also had to adjust to male/female words, and the vast number of verb tenses. But otherwise, Spanish wasn't too tough. At some point, Duolingo claimed that I was \"50% fluent\" in Spanish, but that seems ridiculous lol. This statistic no longer appears after a recent revamp, so they probably realised that too. I don't consider myself anywhere near fluent, but I know enough Spanish to recognize a few words here and there when watching the Spanish scenes in Better Call Saul, so that's a thing. Listening to spoken Spanish is much tougher than reading words off a screen. I suppose if I want to further my mastery of the language, I would need to listen to more Spanish convos or read more Spanish prose or such, but for now I'm happy with continuing the Duolingo lessons. They have since revamped the course and introduced more exercises, so there's still quite a bit to learn.\r\n\r\nSometime in 2017, I also decided to add a second language to my daily Duolingo exercises. Hard mode this time, I chose Japanese. The main reason being I'm a bit of a weeb lol. Japanese is a lot more challenging than Spanish because in addition to learning a whole new vocabulary and sentence structure, I have to learn new characters as well! I actually gave studying hiragana/katakana a go back in high school, when a friend and I tried learning Japanese to decipher some Japanese RPGs (maybe I'll write about that someday). Whatever I learned there has largely faded though, but I did retain some minimum vocabulary from all those years of exposure to anime. It's still very challenging - even up to now I'm still in the introductory sections learning hiragana and simple sentences, I find myself having to repeat lessons and exercises often and even up to now I'm still not super familiar with many of the hiragana characters. I should probably be doing some writing exercises as well (which Duolingo doesn't provide) - the mechanical act of drawing the characters should help with recall - but I've been too lazy to get into that.\r\n\r\nDuolingo is free to use. That of course means there's stuff like ads and in-app purchases, which might annoy you if you dislike that kind of thing. I dislike them too, but I can kind of tolerate them I guess. The in-app purchases don't really have any effect on what I want to be doing with the app anyway. Completing the lessons also earns you some in-game currency which you can use to unlock some extra lessons/exercises. I've never had to use them though, so I still have a ton of the in-app currency. \r\n\r\nDuolingo has that nice feature where it tracks when you're doing the exercises on a regular daily basis and tracks your \"streak\", which is psychologically very effective on me. I often hold the streaks for months and then I accidentally break the streak for some silly reason like being too busy with work, then I'm sad and annoyed and I leave Duolingo alone for a couple of weeks so I can move on. Then I start over. I'm currently at an 86-day streak again. Duolingo is a rare example of a new thing I've managed to stick with for a long time.\r\n\r\nOne weird thing about Duolingo is that although it offers lessons/exercises on different platforms - web, mobile, tablet - the method of delivery is not consistent across all platforms. Web is more limited obviously, since they often won't have access to a microphone. But I don't understand why their mobile and tablet (IPad) versions aren't consistent. The main inconsistency is the way they track in-app \"experience\". The mobile version gives a \"streak bonus\" for maintaining a streak, while the IPad and web versions do not, so you can earn more experience when using the mobile version. It doesn't really matter to me - my daily targets are set such that I always need to do two sets per day (one Spanish and one Japanese), but I find it mildly annoying.\r\n\r\nAll in all Duolingo provides a positive experience, and I'll probably be using it for yearrs to come. I don't really have any specific goals for why I'm learning Spanish and Japanese, both just seem like really good languages to know, or at least be able to partially understand. Who knows, maybe I'll even try to add a third language some day lol.",

At this point, Resistance knows that we’re about to beat it. It hits the panic button. It marshals one last assault and slams us with everything it’s got.\r\n\r\n(Side note: I've put his books on an Amazon wishlist. I should remind myself to do this whenever I find books that sound interesting)\r\n\r\nI think about new projects all the time: game dev ideas, app ideas, programming projects, plot ideas for a novel, and so on. Very few of them go on to completion or at least some version of production. Some reasons I've had difficulty finishing side projects:\r\n\r\nI tend to start losing interest when I come across the boring parts of a project or parts I don't want to do. Some examples are UI/design, or promo work/sales/marketing\r\nI might also be overwhelmed by how much work there is that needs to be done. I understand making breaking down the work into a list and then just choosing one task at a time until you get something done. Hmm, I guess sometimes doing the work breakdown is one of the things that falls under the first bullet\r\nsometimes I might also be frustrated by a lack of technical skill in implementation. I'm thinking this applies mostly to stuff like writing or drawing, where I feel like my execution or creativity isn't good enough. This frustration can be overcome by practice, but practice risks the first bullet again\r\nsometimes I'll also lose motivation if the project turns out too difficult or too time-consuming, as if it's not worth the effort. This can be a legitimate reason for dropping a project, as long as I make sure my assessment is rational.\r\nOne of my main problems seems to be that I'm easily distracted by new, shiny ideas that come along. That's why reading this comic felt a bit like a personal attack:\r\n\r\n via /r/ProgrammerHumor\r\n\r\n\r\nI do have the ability to go into hyperfocus and gain the flow, enough to immerse myself in what I'm doing, but it doesn't always last, and it's a bit of a double-edged sword, because if something else grabs my attention, there's a good chance I'll hyperfocus on that. (Another edge being of course, I can be so hyperfocused in burns me out).\r\n\r\n(Slight tangent: When I'm in a team project, I'm pretty good at getting things done, because (a) there's usually someone else holding me to account and making sure stuff gets done; and (b) there's usually team mates to help take up those parts that I find uninteresting.)\r\n\r\nI didn't list plain old laziness among the reasons above, though I'm surely guilty of that. But I think usually laziness is a symptom of one of these other reasons and me making excuses for not getting stuff done.\r\n\r\nAll of these are some demons I need to tame if I really want to become more independent; I guess at least recognizing them is key and compensating for them where necessary, and making sure I only drop projects if I'm convinced they're not worth it.\r\n\r\nCoincidentally relevant webcomic:\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 1070082567402110977 }}",

The gaming industry has also grown exponentially since then, with many more high-quality \"must play\" releases per year. As a result, I've accumulated a signficant gaming collection and backlog, most of it on PC, but some on consoles too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere's all sorts of ways to get extra games, mostly on PC:\r\n\r\nSteam sales. I'm sure there are some games I've purchased off Steam sales that seemed like a good idea at the time but still haven't gotten around to after years and years. Ever since Steam introduced (cheaper) regional pricing, it's been a lot harder to resist the sales\r\nHumble Bundles. I really enjoyed humble bundles when they first came out, they had some great indie games like Bastion and Braid. Recently their bundles have dipped a bit in quality, and there's been a bunch of repeats, but I still get a bundle every now and then. Reviewing my previous bundle purchases just now, I've had some steam keys that I haven't activated since 2010!\r\nI also decided to try subscribing to Humble Monthly some time this year, mostly to get Tales of Berseria (which unsurprisingly I haven't played it yet). Getting a bundle of 6-8 games every month is a quick way to accumuate a backlog. I unsubbed after a couple of months because the quality of succeeding bundles wasn't that high\r\nthe major digital stores (Steam, GOG, Humble) also often have promotional giveaways throughout the year, so that builds up the backlog too\r\non the console side, I've been a Playstation Plus subscriber a long time, so I count that as part of my backlog too - there's a bunch of PS+ games I've been meaning to get around to but haven't yet\r\n\r\nAll the bundles also results in me getting some duplicate keys. To alleviate the backlog, every few years I even do a holiday giveaway of a few Steam games to friends and family on Facebook (sorry if we're not friends there lol).\r\n\r\nI'm trying to do better - this year I have been trying to work through my older gaming backlogs (I even completed Skyrim after 7 years!) and minimize my game spending, though I still did buy quite a few games. (Hmm, maybe it would be nice to do some data analytics of how many games I've bought/played on Steam year-on-year.) The lack of free time for gaming is a serious problem too, combined with a few other factors:\r\n\r\nmy tendency to want to get all the achievements for a game often significantly increases the playtime per game\r\nlong-term games that reward daily grinding (a more common theme these days) take up some of my gaming time as well. The most recent culprits are Eternal and MTG Arena\r\nnew games coming out that I want to play lol\r\n\r\nRealistically, I'll never be able to got through my entire Steam collection in my lifetime, but I can try! Maybe I should do something like go through all the small games first, and just immediately stop playing if I find them not to my liking. (This is a bit difficult for me since I dislike giving up on things). Hmm, that's an idea. What if I do a Twitch/Youtube channel where I feature and try out lesser-known indie games on Steam? I certainly have a whole lot of them! Something to consider for the future!",

Okay wait, that's not accurate. I'm fine with the gift giving. The real problem I have with is gift-buying.\r\n\r\nI'm not good at buying gifts for other people. The main problem I guess is that I'm not good at buying things in general, unless those are things that are of particular interest to me. And since my interests are a bit niche, there tends to be not much overlap with what gifts I think other people will appreciate. I tend to not know what sort of gifts are good or even appropriate to give to other people.\r\n\r\nFor a group of people, the concept of fairness comes into mind as well. Like, if I have a group of friends that I regard at about the same level, it would feel weird to me to only give a gift to one or two of them, it seems not fair to the others. This leads to even more gift-buying paralysis.\r\n\r\nThe other day I was at a mall and saw there was a sale on some DC Superhero Girls Lego sets, and my niece loves Lego and she's also my goddaughter and so I figured I would get her one as a gift. And I did, even though in this country Lego sets at 50% are still a bit pricey. But I kind of had a bit of buyer's remorse, not because it wasn't a good gift (I think it was), but it set me up for an additional dilemma: my 1-year old nephew is also my godson, and now I felt compelled to buy him a gift that has around the same value, otherwise it doesn't feel \"fair\". But I have no idea what to get for a 1yo! Looking forward to my nephews growing old enough in a few years that I can give them Transformers!)\r\n\r\nI will probably end up handing the parents a cash gift, they'll understand. Cash is a great gift because it's unproblematic, but it can also seem a bit thoughtless. But anyone who knows how bad I am at buying things will understand. I often give cash as wedding gifts.\r\n\r\nAnother common gift-giving scenario in the Philippines is the secret santa/kris kringle/gift exchange that is quite common especially among office workers during Christmas season, usually with some approximate expected gift value. This is usually okay for me, as long as people aren't unnecessarily pressured into joining an exchange if they don't want to. I especially like it when the exchange participants are expected to provide a wishlist - this alleviates my handicap a bit. While I understand the spirit of gift exchanges as a social function, it does seem a bit inefficient to me. Logically, gift satisfaction can be maximized by each person just buying what they want for themselves.\r\n\r\nAlso, typically most exchanges will have value requirements in the P300 to P500 range, for which I don't have much options in what I'd ask for - anything I want for myself will tend to be at least slightly more expensive than that. These days I tend to ask for some grocery type stuff like quezo de bola or spam.\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote, only slightly related: when we were kids, my brother had this gift exchange in school that he forgot to ask my mom to get a gift for. I helped him put together a weird gift out of scraps (to put it kindly). We had fun putting it together, but the recipient did not appreciate it, and I remember he said he got a scolding from the teacher lol.\r\n\r\nAnyway, the end result of all of this combined with my usual frugality is that I rarely buy anyone gifts, even for Christmas or birthdays. I will sometimes buy gifts if I happen to chance something that I know the recipient will like (like the Lego example above), especially if it's on sale or at a reasonable price. Most other occasions I think family and friends already know I don't usually give gifts. And in return, I tend to not expect too much in the way of gifts either, although I am of course appreciative of them.",

While I hold out a tiny bit of hope that maybe somehow human society and/or science will find a way to save us, he was not so optimistic. He reads and writes a lot of speculative fiction and his view is that we are inevitably headed towards an era of land scarcity and resulting wars due to climate changes.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine, some thousands of years down the line, some spacefaring alien race chances upon the remains of our sorry civilization and discover all this discussion of our civilization's impending collapse and they're trying to figure out why our civilization fell apart in spite of having sufficient foreknowledge of the upcoming disaster, and they're incredulous that we simply couldn't be bothered because it was too inconvenient!\r\n\r\nWould humanity still be able to find a way out of this corner we've painted our way into? Recent signs are not encouraging. We know there is upcoming disaster and yet any adjustment on our part must come at great economic or political costs that we are unable to pay. Climate change is a far-away risk for most people who struggle with everyday problems. Consider the case of Macron's France, which was recently forced by protests to withdraw a fuel tax that was intended to reduce the country's climate impact. Trump uses this event to justify the US withdrawal from the Paris climate treaty. The US clings to its climate-destroying industries like coal in a bid to save jobs. Companies refuse to be regulated because it would be too expensive. And so it goes.\r\n\r\nThis inability to come together and bypass individual interests and work towards a common good may very well be what is called the great filter, and it is in front of us, leading to a high probability of self-destruction. Inequality, itself a result of unbridled individualism, makes it much harder for us to come together as well. Capitalism, in spite of its propensity for ruthless efficiency, is not very good at managing a communal property like our planet (or the internet, etc). By endearing ourself to capitalism during the 20th century, we may have chosen a path of doom for our civilization.\r\n\r\nAll this actually made me rethink authoritarianism. Our cultural embrace of freedoms make it difficult to force people to swallow bitter pills needed for our civilization to survive. What if the path to sustainable collective survival lies in the private sector made ruthlessly efficient by capitalism, yet tempered by an authoritarian state that manages the common good? What if China was right all along? They are certainly more committed to battling climate change at the moment, compared to the US.\r\n\r\nI don't advocate any shift towards authoritarianism or fascism of course, but it might be time to consider surrendering some of our individual freedoms and ambitions for the greater good. Inequality needs to be addressed too, some level of socialism might be necessary, such that the burden may be shouldered more by the elites who have taken most of the benefits from the planet anyway.\r\n\r\nPersonally, I think I already have a very low carbon footprint, compared to the average middle class person. I try not to travel too much (even within the city), and I don't drive a car. But the weight of these decisions isn't on us ordinary citizens, especially the developing world. There is very little we can do individually. The onus is on the leadership especially of the more advanced nations, to take the bold steps necessary to reduce inequality and emissions, and on the elite, to participate in the redistribution of wealth and to make sacrifices for the greater good. For the rest of us, all we can do is raise our voices in protest.\r\n\r\nI sound like I'm calling for some kind of revolution, but I'm merely thinking out loud. I'm worried for what is to come. For my generation, things will probably be fine. But if nothing is done, the next 2 or 3 generations might be looking at living vastly more difficult lives. I realize this post seems really pessimistic (same for the prior one), which seems a bit off-brand for me. Maybe if we're lucky, I'm totally wrong and within the next 5-10 years some kind of solution emerges, and I'll look back at this post and laugh at how silly I was to be worried, but given the nature of humans and society it's difficult to be optimistic.",

I have chat messages as far back as 2016 musing about buying a Macbook Pro. I haven't had a serious personal laptop purchase since 2008. (Side note: Qualifier \"serious\" because I do have a low-spec MSI laptop I think I bought for cheap some years ago that I'm not really happy with. It's got a dead battery now, I should probably install it with a more lightweight Linux or something and maybe use it as a torrent device or such?)\r\n\r\nMy main motivation for getting a Macbook might seem a bit shallow: I want to be able to publish apps on Apple's app store. Not having a Mac, this particular avenue of software development is closed off to me, so it limits my future freelance work possibilities a bit. Secondary reason being that I am fond of exploring alternative OSes even though I grew up on Windows.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, dropping hints to friends and relatives that I would appreciate being gifted with a Macbook Pro didn't work. The main thing holding me back from buying a Mac is that they're really very expensive devices. I eventually decided to bite the bullet myself and I purchased a Macbook Air (2017 model, 256gb SSD) last October. Macbook Air instead of Pro so I could save a little bit of money (it helped to convince myself to buy). Also, I'm a bit of a Mac newbie anyway, so maybe it was better to start with a slightly cheaper model before going all hardcode? I wanted to avoid the more recent MBPs anyway due to reported issues with the new keyboard. The MBA2017 had a bit of a better hardware spec than the newer Macbooks available at the time as well, so went ahead with the purchase. (It so happened that about a month later, Apple announced a 2018 line of Macbook Airs, but you know, choose without regret).\r\n\r\n{{ figure src=\"/uploads/2018/macbookair.jpg\" caption=\"Chocnut for scale\" }}\r\n\r\nI do have a bit of experiencec using a Mac, since I was on an iOS dev team for a short while back at my old job (where my contribution to the project mainly consisted of proposing ways to clean up the very messy Objective-C code base). Back then I had a Mac Mini assigned to me, and I found myself warming up to Mac OS X easily. I can't fully articulate why, but it seems like a very nice piece of software. There's a lot of minor UI things that I appreciate and while Windows 10 already has something close to it, Spotlight still feels special, especially since it's been around longer. And I really appreciate the sleek aluminum build; unlike many Windows laptops it doesn't feel shoddily put together. It's also quite a bit lighter than the work-issued laptop I was previously using.\r\n\r\nI think I am generally happy with the purchase, although to be honest I haven't used it too much because I've been cutting back on my work hours since October (which means less computing time is on the move), but it has come in handy on occasion when I'd like to work on things away from my desk. There is a tiny bit of friction when switching between devices with different OSes, mainly that keyboard shortcuts are often completely different - things often don't map cleanly between Windows' Ctrl and Alt and Mac's Cmd, Option and Ctrl. That being said, it is decent enough for programming work - VS Code and XCode both run smoothly, and it allowed me to finally update an iOS app I've supposedly  been maintaining. \r\n\r\nThe Macbook Air 2017 is a nice, handy little machine, and I hope to be using it for years to come.",

But I figured I could put in a little commentary about how this thing is going so far. I'm coming off the POV of a long-time Magic the Gathering player of course, with a little bit of comparison to Eternal and Hearthstone, the two digital CCGs I'm most familiar with.\r\n\r\nClient, Ruleset, and Gameplay\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnlike the earlier Duels of the Planeswalkers game, it looks MTG Arena is a complete implementation of the paper MTG ruleset, but with a more limited card base. At the moment, only the cards from the current standard are currently available (sets from the previous rotation were available during the closed beta.) Granted, the MTG ruleset is a complicated beast, so they probably have a few bugs hidden away there somewhere but for the most part it is a faithful conversion.\r\n\r\nThe client looks and feels great, a much more modern platform compared to the ugly rustbucket that is MTGO, they really built upon what they started with Duels. Some of the QoL improvements from both Duels and MTGO carry over (mostly Duels). Autotapping of lands and autopass of priority when you have nothing to play are enabled by default. I'm always worried that the autotapper will screw something up and leave me in a bad position, but so far that hasn't happened. You can add stops to opponent's upkeep, draw, first and second mains, and end step, same as MTGO. \"Attack All\" is available, though I wish it worked better with planeswalkers. When cards from your opponent's hand are revealed, they stay revealed (you can hover over the opponent's hand to zoom in) until they leave that zone.\r\n\r\nThere's a few issues with the presentation though: \r\n\r\ntriggered abilities could have more options to better handle when they trigger multiple times. One of the worst offenders is {{ card }}Ajani's Pridemate{{ /card }}, which is in one of the better starter decks. The triggered ability requires a player confirmation every time, which can be annoying when the Pridemate triggers multiple times on complicated boards. There should be an option like \"Always take this action\", similar to MTGO's \"Always yield\" for triggered abilities\r\ntimeouts need a lot of work. The main issue is that the timers still count down while the client is animating effects and you can't do anything. That time really shouldn't count against you. \r\ndamage dealt to creatures and toughness penalties are presented the same way, as lowered red toughness numbers on the creature itself, even though rules-wise they are actually different - the main difference being indestructible doesn't prevent death due to 0 toughness or less. I've already seen at least one confused newbie on reddit trying to figure out how indestructibility works and being confused because of this.\r\n\r\n New Player Experience and Economy\r\n\r\nNPE is okay. You get a bunch of starter decks, one for each color and color pair. Same as Eternal actually. The starter decks also provide some decent cards to start out your collection, with some mythics even. Some useful cards they provide include {{ card }}History of Benalia{{ /card }}, {{ card }}Rekindling Phoenix{{ /card }}, {{ card }}Settle the Wreckage{{ /card }} and {{ card }}Vraska's Contempt{{ /card }} IDK what they're going to do when there's a rotation and the starter decks don't work anymore. Well actually, I guess I don't know what they plan to do for rotation at all, so we'll just see what happens.\r\n\r\nSame as Hearthstone and Eternal, there's daily quests to help you earn gold, and you can win gems from some events, so there's that. You also get a free pack every five wins, with a cap of three such packs per week. I haven't done the math but I'd say the rewards system is slightly more generous than Hearthstone, but way less generous than Eternal. You also get some rewards for each win for the day, but this drops off quickly.\r\n\r\nThe weird thing is they didn't go with a \"dusting\" system for extra cards, which is how other CCGs usually do it. Crafting is instead done using rarity-specific \"wildcards\" which you can open from booster packs. This leads to the so-called \"fifth card problem\", where whenever you open the fifth copy of a card from a booster pack, it literally has no use for you. They have scheduled a \"duplicate protection\" update to fix this sometime around 1Q2019, but I'm not sure if that'll work out. I hope they also think about some mechanism for \"cashing out\" your rotating cards since they need to implement rotations less than a year from now, but I'm even less hopeful about that.\r\n\r\nLimited Play\r\n\r\nThere's draft and sealed options available, with formats (the sets being opened) rotating every two weeks. When I started out I played mostly drafts (as soon as I had the gold, I would draft), since I didn't have enough of a collection yet to make a decent constructed deck. The draft experience isn't exactly the same as paper though. For one thing, you're drafting against bots, not actual humans. Eternal is able to make draft work vs actual humans, so Arena should be able to do it too. IDK how Eternal does it actually, one would presume the first few people to draft a format won't have other draft pools yet to be passed to them. Regardless, Arena should be passing you packs from real humans whenever possible and bots only when no such packs are available. Still, the draft experience is passable.\r\n\r\n Constructed Play\r\n\r\nThere's a ranked ladder which you can play for free, both Best of 1 (BO1) and Best of 3 (BO3) options are available. You can also play in Constructed Events, which have an entry fee and offer more prizes, and there's also BO1 and BO3 options there. They also often have \"fun\" events in different formats like Singleton or some strange format with custom rules. Kind of like Hearthstone's Tavern Brawl I guess?\r\n\r\nThe limiter for constructed play is your available wildcards. Getting rare wildcards is reasonable enough - you are guaranteed to get one every six packs you open. Mythics are another matter, you are only guaranteed to get one every thirty-six packs. So for a F2P player (that's me!) you will be likely constrained to decks with lower mythic counts, at least early on. For now, I've been playing Monoblue Tempo, a tier 2 deck (really has trouble against a resolved ) that has no mythics and has decent play value. I do love me some aggro control, so this is a fine choice for me for now. I've been playing it in BO3 Competitive Constructed Events (recently renamed to \"Traditional Constructed\"), and have a decent enough winrate that it has always made me profit. Standard is in a pretty good place right now actually - there's a ton of viable decks and quite a few other decks that are relatively easy to put together, like monored or Izzet Drakes, so it's a good time to be playing standard in Arena.\r\n\r\nIt's great to have an option for BO3 play. The complexity of competitive Magic shines through in BO3 play, although it takes much longer to play them out. Actually, Magic games in general, even BO1, take longer to play than Eternal (which is weird because Eternal has higher deck size and starting life), which means grinding out wins as a F2P player would be more exhausting. There was a recent outcry when they announced a tweak to constructed rewards that would have made BO3 events much less appealing, basically giving them the same rewards structure as BO1 events, which is ridiclous since BO3 games take so much more time. They walked back on that change though, but haven't announced a replacement yet, let's see if they do better next time. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI also have this not-so-competitive BG midrange deck that I was building towards before I netdecked the MonoBlue one. I had already spent a few mythic wildcards towards it, kind of a bad choice really, because the ranked ladder does this weird matchmaking thing where you're more likely to fight against decks that have similar rare/mythic counts. So what usually happens is my unoptimized BG monstrosity gets roflstomped by tuned netdecks and such. After discovering this, I now mostly only play either the starter decks on ranked (to fulfill my daily quests) or Competitive Constructed with the Monoblue (in order to build up gold/cards). I still occasionally do break out the BG deck for fun.\r\n\r\nI wrote most of the above paragraphs in a draft a week or two ago, and they just recently released a new patch that overhauled the rank system and matchmaking. I haven't explored it too much yet, I hope it's better.\r\n\r\nF2P, ESports, and Competitive Play\r\n\r\nWizards announced recently that Arena will join the Pro Tour as part of their competitive play offerings and there will be a combined $10M prize pool for both paper Magic and Arena in 2019. This is exciting for me because it offers a more convenient avenue for competitive play. I'll be honest, I'm a bit older now and I'm not too fond of playing in big paper MTG tournaments anymore. You have to travel somewhere, and it's often hot and crowded and I have to shufffle with my sweat hands and you have to make sure your opponent's not cheating and so on. But if I'm playing from the comfort of my home computer, well that's a lot better for me! \r\n\r\nI was initially planning to play Arena same way I play other online CCGs - grinding it out as a F2P player. But I might be willing to change that depending on how the competitive landscape looks moving forward. It will probably be cheaper for me in the long run anyway - both paper Magic and MTGO are expensive options. So I'm hoping WOTC doesn't screw this up and provides a decent tournament experience for Arena. It's especially timely as there's no convenient Grand Prixs near me next year so I was planning to kind of lay low with paper Magic anyway.\r\n\r\n Summary\r\n\r\nMTG Arena is still in open beta, and I assume the formal release will be around late 2019, when the next rotation comes in. I'll probably make a follow-up post at that time. I'm optimistic and hoping for the best and hopefully all the issues will be ironed out. Arena has the potential to trounce the online CCG scene, especially since Valve's Artifact hasn't been able to live up to its hype (though I might still try it). All Wizards has to do is to not screw things up!",

The best puns are so terrible and so great at the same time. Puns are like a tiny puzzle that your brain has to solve and when you do solve them, your brain has that tiny flash of \"A-ha!\" and it feels great, but then you realize how contrived the pun was and groan internally at how terrible it was. \r\n\r\nThis is why the best puns elicit reactions like this (these are reactions to the image above):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI think being bilingual also helps with the puns, because then you get to make jokes because of words that sound the same across two languages. My dad used to do this a lot when we were kids (this might explain a lot!). He would say something like \"I'm going to go to Taco Beach!\" because Taco Beach sounds like \"takubets\" which is 80s style slang for \"kubeta\", meaning the toilet. (I have never heard anyone else refer to the toilet this way!) Another pun that I got from him was \"What's the Tagalog for 'tweeter'\"? Back then, the word tweeter didn't actually get used a lot, but in modern times, I changed it to this:\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 1872502526 }}\r\n\r\nI wish I had more puns to share here right now, but it's hard to remember them. When I release a pun, it passes from my brain to the world and it belongs to the universe now. In hindsight, maybe whenever I posted a pun, I should have included some kind of hashtag. In my opinion, puns are a gift to the world. They inspire you to think creatively, and being used to making puns developer your wit. Because they are a gift to the world, whenever you think of a pun, it is your responsibility to unleash it upon the world, no matter how terrible you think it is. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Maybe I'll play Fire Emblem Fates just to see this dialogue lol)\r\n\r\nPun with intention! This is one my tenets: No puns left unsaid!",

Please include the word PINEAPPLE (all caps) in your communication.\r\n\r\nIn the five or so years since I placed this clause, none of the dozens of recruiters who have contacted me via email or phone call or even via just sending a connection request on LinkedIn itself has ever complied with this clause in any way. \r\n\r\nI've seen people using LinkedIn from the other side - looking for candidates to fill positions - and most of them will just quickly skim your profile to see if you tick all the checkboxes of what they're looking for. Recruiters and other people looking to hire have to sift through lots of resumes and profiles and very few will bother to go through your entire history.\r\n\r\nOverall, I am not convinced that LinkedIn is at all useful or that it has been a net positive for me personally, but I still have a profile and sometimes post my blog entries there. Also, given that I want to reduce Facebook usage, it's probably a good idea to have work-related contacts on LinkedIn instead of Facebook moving forward.",

This number is a lie meant only to entice you to login and has no correlation to the actual pending notifictations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDave Winer makes a point that Facebook, despite all its flaws, did bring something good to humanity, even if only for a little while.\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 1075254515149008896 }}\r\n\r\nI don't know what happens next.

I mean, I do tend to use my real name as username after all, so most everything I do online can be traced back to me. I assume that anything I do on the internet can be figured out by other parties, so if something is important enough to me that it should be kept private, it shouldn't go on the internet at all. \r\n\r\nFor the services provided by Facebook and Google, I accept that they require tracking my data in order to provide those services. For example, a few months ago I made a Protonmail account so I'd have a secure email that I can use in place of GMail. But it turns out, I haven't found a good use case for it yet. I use Gmail's search a lot, and ProtonMail is nowhere that robust. Maybe if I were a spy or something, I would consider using ProtonMail, but for now I think for everyday usage the GMail features are an acceptable tradeoff for the fact that they are reading your email data and using it for targetted advertising. \r\n\r\nI also tried using the alternative, privacy-focused search engine DuckDuckGo, but I was not too happy with the search results I was getting, and I occasionally find it useful to be able to check my search history for stuff I remember finding but could no longer find. Having my search results tailored for me turned out kind of useful too.\r\n\r\nReading some forum discussions, there are a lot of people who are vehemently against being tracked for the purposes of targetted advertising. I can understand the sentiment, but personally I don't mind targetted advertising because (a) it's marginally better than being bombarded with ads for things you don't actually care about; and (b) I am not easily susceptible to impulse purchases, at least not due to internet ads. I grew up with the free internet, so even if I wasn't using adblock, my brain automatically ignores ads on its own.\r\n\r\nTo be honest, I accept that these companies are tracking my data because I would track my own data if I could. I find it useful to have my own history. An example is location history; I have my phone GPS on all the time, so Google Maps is able to keep a history of where I've gone everyday. I reference this every so often, because I'm forgetful. \"Where did I go last Wednesday?\" is a trivial question to answer when the cloud has the data. As a software developer, I could build my own systems to track this myself, but why bother? I use the cloud as an extension of my own memory, which is often fallible.\r\n\r\nI have been starting to wean myself off Facebook, though that proves difficult due to network effects. But it would probably be more difficult for me to cease usage of my Google account, since I use it for a bunch of cloud stuff. Well, I did get it started by making Firefox my main browser.\r\n\r\nI do understand the use case for privacy. If you're handling any sort of sensitive information or anything dangerous, say as an investigative journalist in a fascist regime, then maybe an extra level of protection is required. So I appreciate the existence of secure alternatives. I recently found a reddit thread that had a good summary of the modern online privacy options available. If you want or need online privacy, you have to understand that there's a tradeoff in terms of convenience. You can give up Google or Facebook services or use Tor and VPNs and all those other stuff, but you lose some features too. And maybe that's fine, it's up to you to determine that's acceptable for you.",

Thankfully, I've been able to hold myself back so far. \r\n\r\nTo help suppress such urges, I've also recently resumed private journalling, a practice I haven't revisited for quite a while. Basically just a document where I can dump my own thoughts about things that are probably inappropriate for public consumption. So I get the benefits of writing my thoughts down without any possible privacy issues. So far the need for private journal entries has been few and far between. Between the blog and the private journal, it should be a lot easier for me to take a look back at what I was thinking at any given point in time, should the need arise. \r\n\r\nThe last time I did the private journalling thing was with a service called 750 words, which was pretty good. It inspired me into a daily writing habit for a bit more than a year. I should probably go through those sometime and see if I can't mine them for blog posts.\r\n\r\nAs for this blog and the daily posting thing, I have to admit the past week or so has been challenging. The week of Christmas is usually busy as there's last minute gift buying and family visitors and holiday meetups and such so I don't always have the time and/or energy to write posts. I thought about breaking the \"daily posting\" rule a few times, but somehow managed to keep it going. The problem with requiring myself to post every day is that it violates \"You don't have to be on all the time\". While writing this post, I considered loosening the commitment for the New Year, something like \"post every day, unless you really don't have time or energy\", but that's pretty much how habits are broken. I do still find the practice fruitful, so I will continue it for the time being, as much as I can.",

And that satisfaction is linked to forming satisfying memories of experiences, and not the fleeting experiences themselves.\r\n\r\n Still, it’s worth asking if we want to be happy, to experience positive feelings, or simply wish to construct narratives that seems worth telling ourselves and others, but doesn’t necessarily yield pleasure.\r\n\r\nMy own attitude towards happiness has evolved throughout the years. I think that right now my personal concept involves some mixture of joy (what he describes as fleeting happiness, enjoying the current moment), meaningful (participating in activies that make me feel sufficiently engaged or challenged), and avoidance of discomfort or boredom. The joy part may be simply things like spending time in the company of friends, reading a good book, enjoying a good movie, and so on. But those different elements live in a precarious balance. I can't be enjoying myself all the time, it would get boring. I need to intersperse enjoyment with meaningful activities. So I imagine in the day to day equation, the answer to \"what makes me happy?\" depends on which element of the balance needs to be reinforced at that moment.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of avoiding discomfort or boredom is a bit more complicated than the others. I made a promise to myself some time ago that I would avoid doing things that I don't want to do. This may seem nonsenical, I mean of course you don't do things you don't want to do. Except sometimes you do, maybe because of work pressure, peer pressure, or societal pressure or something else. So I wanted to avoid those kinds of things. But life isn't that straightforward, and sometimes you do want do some things that cause you discomfort or boredom, if they satisfy some other goal. Like for example, you can sacrifice your comfort for a while if it helps you get a dream business off the ground. Or you can participate in an activity you dislike because you know it will make your family happy. And so on. \r\n\r\nThis post ended up a bit of a meandering ramble, maybe because the concept of happiness itself is not so simple as we want it to be. I was just inspired to think a bit more about happiness because of the article. I suspect I will be revisiting this topic at a later time, and hopefully will be better able to express my thoughts on happiness.\r\n\r\nOr maybe happiness isn't a set of principles to be encoded, just simply a life to be lived.",

My impression then of the site is that it encouraged insightful, well-written, story-like answers. This was opposed to other Q&A sites like Stackoverflow which encourared concise and clinical answers. This impression was amplified by the 2013 release of a Best of Quora EBook which I thoroughly enjoyed. \r\n\r\nIn 2016, during a work hiatus, I started trying to write on Quora as well. You can follow me there if you like.. I found writing on Quora useful as an exercise, it helped me improve on my own writing and to expound my thoughts. I often sought out more open-ended questions so that I could write more, although I wasn't particularly successful in that regard. I managed to post quite a few answers back in 2016, and my Quora stats page tells me my answers have collectively gotten 168k views and 608 upvotes as of this writing. Not sure if that's anything to brag about, but I guess it's something?\r\n\r\nI was tempted to write about Quora because of two things:\r\n\r\nThey've recently been hacked. They immediately notified their users, which is good. \r\n\r\n The following information of yours may have been compromised:\r\n \r\n     Account and user information, e.g. name, email, IP, user ID, encrypted password, user account settings, personalization data\r\n \r\n     Public actions and content including drafts, e.g. questions, answers, comments, blog posts, upvotes\r\n \r\n     Data imported from linked networks when authorized by you, e.g. contacts, demographic information, interests, access tokens (now invalidated)\r\n \r\n     Non-public actions, e.g. answer requests, downvotes, thanks\r\n \r\n Questions and answers that were written anonymously are not affected by this breach as we do not store the identities of people who post anonymous content.\r\n\r\nNone of the above particularly concerns me, though I understand it might concern other people.\r\n\r\nAndy Baio of waxy.org writes about Why You Should Never, Ever Use Quora\r\n\r\n All of Quora’s value is derived from the answers provided by its users, and they go to great lengths to make a well-designed platform for finding and replying to questions.\r\n \r\n But they do everything they can to make sure you can’t get those contributions back out.\r\n \r\n Quora has:\r\n \r\n     No public API.\r\n     No backup or export tools.\r\n     Restricted access to answers without an account.\r\n     Blocked scrapers and unofficial APIs, and deleted questions related to scraping on their site.\r\n\r\nThe \"no backup\" is something I only noticed after reading his post and is particularly glaring to me, since I've recently had a policy of wanting to have offline access to all content I've ever written on the internet. \r\n\r\nI stopped answering questions regularly on Quora around 2017, although I still read it every so often. There are still a lot of well-written answers, and I still find my Quora Daily Digest emails useful, but given the above two points I will have to re-evaluate how I use Quora in the future. The first thing will probably be to look for a way to export my content!",

Citizens with low scores can get penalized in various ways like being denied travel or access to top-tier schools and so on. It's quite creepy, and the mere idea evokes the dystopian Black Mirror episode \"Nosedive\") where people use an app to rate other people.\r\n\r\nChina's social credit system might be even worse than the Black Mirror one because:\r\n\r\nit's instigated by the state, instead of a (presumably) commercial app like in Black Mirror. Instead of people you interact with regularly rating you, it's now some faceless bureaucrat who might have an agenda. At least if it's people, you might be able to cozy up enough to other people to get your rating back up. \r\nhow would you opt out? In the Black Mirror episode, the protagonist's brother was the type of person who didn't care about social status so the ratings didn't affect him. In a system administered by the state and applied universally, you have no choice. Well, I guess you can still be all \"meh, I don't care\" and just don't avail of the benefits unlocked by higher ratings, but since it's the state promoting this, it's likely the scope where the ratings matter will only become larger with time\r\n\r\nWhy is the idea of a rating system inherently creepy? People judge other people all the time. We judge other people by how they look, the clothes they wear, how they behave, where they went to school, what job they have, what kind of car they drive, and so on. And people often do change their own behavior to influence how others judge them. In certain countries, they already have financial rating systems that allow companies to judge you based on your credit history. It's simply a factor in how human societies work.\r\n\r\nI think having a numeric rating system for social behavior feels so off because it attempts to quantify something that we understand to be inherently subjective, and attempts to impose that standard rating system indiscriminately. And a rating attached to each person universally feels like it would be very difficult to shake off. If someone judges you based on your looks or your clothes you can always change them. If all the people in your neighborhood dislike you, you can always move to a new area. But if there's a quantitative rating attached to you in some centralized database somewhere? People who don't know you can judge you instantly, even if they've never heard of your past indiscretions. The rating would follow you around where ever you go.\r\n\r\nAt least financial credit systems are there to promote good financial decisions (since they are used to judge your credit risk). China's social credit system looks like it's designed to promote obedience to the state or adherence to state-preferred behavior, which means reduced freedoms. One can only hope such an experiment fails and does not propagate to other more democratic-leaning countries, but given the recent worldwide trends, I am not too hopeful.",

My idea was to use this to analyze my public posts (specifically, on Twitter), to see whether I was trending towards being more positive or more negative. Unfortunately, when I tabulated the data, it was unexciting. No discernable trend of any kind, no plateaus signalling times of stability. Just wild swinging ups and downs as you'd expect from a normal, well-adjusted person. I can't even get a technical blog post out of it since the process was mind-numbingly simply, I just used the straightforward Python TextBlob library which had a sentiment analysis function.\r\n\r\nSometimes things don't work out, and that's fine. Not everything you try is going to be a success. Not all experiments lead to some fantastic discovery. We simply pick ourselves up and move on to the next thing, or the next iteration. If we're lucky, maybe we learn something new that helps us with the next thing.\r\n\r\nIt is the nature of human advancement: rarely do things succeed on the first try, in many cases it's simply a matter of trial and error, of trying a variety of things until something sticks. This is why using an incremental approach is often advisable - trying small things until they succeed and chaining small things into bigger things, so that at any given stage you never fail too much.",

There's a seemingly endless stream of problems to be overcome, bad news to be angry about, movies to watch, tv shows to binge, games to play, books to read, pictures to share, gossip to be had, new things to learn, challenges to be faced, and so on. And with all of these comes the pressure to make the most of your time, to make sure it isn't \"wasted\".\r\n\r\nIn between all of these, it's important that we don't forget to give ourselves space for rest. Collapsing into bed at the end of a tiring day is rest for the body, but we need rest for the conscious mind as well. Space for our mind to wander. Space for background thoughts to percolate. Space for the conscious mind to step aside and let the unconscious process everything the world throws down upon us. \r\n\r\nDuring the decade and change that I was working a regular nine-to-five, that downtime often came during the otherwise torturous Metro Manila commute. These days, I have a lot more free time at home, but even that free time tends to be consumed by reading or some kind of electronic activity - a temptation often difficult to resist. So most days I find that space during my daily walking. Sometimes I'll miss the daily walk for a day or maybe two in a row (most often due to weather), and I'll feel a bit restless or out of sorts. The space that walking gives me some time to myself where I let the problems of the world simply wash over me. \r\n\r\nFind time to make your own spaces in between as well.",

It's a basic courtesy.\r\n\r\nIf you made an appointment to meet at a certain time and place, and it looks you're not going to be able to go, message the other party and tell them. If you think you're going to be late, tell them. If it's especially bad, ask if they would want to reschedule.\r\n\r\nIf you agreed to do some work by a certain time, but later you find you aren't going to make it on time, tell them as soon as possible, as soon as you find out you're not going to make it. Heck, maybe as soon as you think it's likely. It's better if you can propose some mitigation to minimize the impact of the delays.\r\n\r\nIf you owe someone money and you promise you can pay them back in monthly installments, but later you find you can't make the payments, tell them. Don't make the other person have to ask why payments are being missed. And if it's going to be a problem moving forward, say so, and maybe propose an alternative, or a new payment schedule that works for you. Don't just leave the other person wondering if they're ever going to see their money.\r\n\r\nObviously, it's better to just don't make promises you can't keep. But things happen, and often people will understand. And if they don't, then next time you should know better not to overestimate promises made to those people.\r\n\r\nFor me personally, this only applies if it's an actual person you've owed something to. If it's some corporation, it's probably not necessary - corporations like your electricity provider won't understand and will just cut you off instead of considering any alternatives. But for actual humans? It's a basic courtesy.",

Now, I'm pretty sure I watch a lot of TV, unapologetically.  Quite possible too much. But I can't help but wonder if maybe I would be more productive if I had the same kind of discipline Bill Gates had, and maybe that would increase the odds that I could focus and create something of consequence?\r\n\r\nThat being said, the idea of cutting off TV completely feels completely ludicrous to me. It's simply something I enjoy too much. Just this past week I was gushing over the Arrowverse Elseworlds crossover which gave me real fanboy delight. But I thought maybe I could review my current regular TV slate and see if I can't trim it a bit.\r\n\r\nDC Comics TV: There's from the aforementioned Arrowverse shows (Arrow, Flash, Supergirl, Legends of Tomorrow). I feel like Arrow should have ended a season or 2 ago, but I still mostly enjoy Flash, Supergirl and Legends. There's also Gotham, which is ending with its next season, and I kinda wanna see how it ends. Aside from those, I also want to watch Titans (DC Universe) and Krypton (Syfy); not sure if I should bother with Black Lightning.\r\n\r\nMarvel Comics TV: The Marvel TV shows don't have as much of a \"shared universe\" feel unlike the Arrowverse. There's the Netflix group of shows of course (Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Luke Cage, Iron Fist, Punisher), but it looks like we're only getting at most one more season each of Jessica Jones and Punisher, and the rest are already cancelled. Agents of SHIELD has been great and is up for at least one more season. I'm also supposedly watching The Gifted but I'm way behind on season 2. Also looking forward to the next season of Runaways. I've had Legion on my to-watch list for a while as well, but haven't gotten around to it.\r\n\r\nOther: Doctor Who, but I'm behind for the current season, and this has so few episodes per year, it probably shouldn't count.\r\n\r\nProcedurals: I used to watch a few more of these that have since ended (Bones, Castle). The only one I still follow now is Criminal Minds, and I've watched almost all of that, so I know the characters well. It might be a fine candidate to drop though. One can only take so much serial murdering.\r\n\r\nComedies: There's Brooklyn Nine-Nine, which is some of the best comedy right now on TV. I still watch The Good Place, which despite all the praise it gets, I'm not superfond of it the way I was with Parks and Rec. I also still watch The Big Bang Theory and Modern Family - those shows aren't the best or super laugh out loud, but they're sometimes interesting. The last two might be worth cutting.\r\n\r\nAnimated: Really only The Simpsons (out of loyalty) and Rick and Morty (when it decides to come back). \r\n\r\nThat's not counting the shows on Netflix I randomly decide to pick and binge (recently: The Ranch, Better Call Saul, Adventure Time)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the comics-based shows form a significant majority of my shows. Just counting those that have full season lengths, it's at least 10 hours a week on TV watching, a nontrivial amount of time. One method I've been using to better make the most of TV time is what I call \"side-watching\", i.e. having the TV show playing on a secondary screen while I'm doing other stuff on a primary screen, like working or playing games. It's a more efficient use of time, but I can't focus as much on the show, so it doesn't work on all shows. Usually the lighter shows (comedies and animated) are good for these. THe more serious shows I can still \"side-watch\", unless it's an important episode or something where I want to focus on the show (like the aforementioned Elseworlds crossover). This is the same reason I've mostly stopped watching anime - it's impossible to side-watch since most of it is subbed. \r\n\r\nActually now that I've listed them all out, it doesn't seem so bad. Anecdotally, Americans watch around five hours of TV a day on average (35 hours per week), so my 10-15 hours per week doesn't seem so bad by comparison, especially since I'm often doing other stuff at the same time. And half the year those shows are off anyway (IDK what happens to American TV during the off season). Still a ways off from Bill Gates though. Maybe I should make a note to try to be more focused/productive during the off season?\r\n\r\nHm. If I really want to make the most of my time, I might need to do more detailed time-tracking since there's a bunch of other leisure activities I also do (gaming, reading, movies, internet browsing), but that seems like a hassle, and it's probably unnecessary. For now, at least.",

It would be a fascinating story, if only it weren't so bad for the world. \r\n\r\nHis character arc is of someone who rose to the level of this own incompetence. \r\n\r\nBefore becoming president, he was basically the worst kind of businessman - a sleazy con man/grifter always looking out for ways to scam other people to further his own interests. A snake oil salesman who somehow stumbled into becoming president of the most powerful country on the planet. \r\n\r\nWho knows why he ran for president? Maybe the Russians goaded him into it. Maybe he thought it was good for his businesses. Maybe he thought he could profit off campaign contributions. The most unlikely reason seems to be that he believes he could do good for his country. \r\n\r\nAnd now he finds himself in a very challenging position, the pressures and problems which could be understand by very few other people in the world. His position is now subject to increased legal scrutiny that could threaten him, his family, and even his con man businesses.\r\n\r\nLike many tech guys, I'm also acutely aware of the problems besetting Mark Zuckerberg and his super-dominant social network Facebook, mostly problems of his own making. Again, it would be a fascinating story, if it weren't so bad for the world. \r\n\r\nMuch like Trump, he seems to have risen to the level of his own incompetence. \r\n\r\nHe started this software company when he was still in college and somehow it grew and snowballed until he was in charge of the most powerful communication platform on the planet. \r\n\r\nHe certainly didn't start out with noble intentions, calling his users \"dumbfucks\" and everything, so it's no surprise he and his company made a lot of stumbles along the way, many of them only coming out just now. \r\n\r\nHe surely had no idea that his proposed advertising business model and his mission of connecting the world would lead to fake news, Russian collusion, and numerous privacy problems. \r\n\r\nHis position as head of Facebook leads to pressures and problems which could be understand by very few other people in the world. And now he finds himself under increased legal scrutiny that could threaten his business model, his company, and even his legacy.\r\n\r\nSomeday (perhaps soon), Trump and Zuckerberg will be held to account for their failings. Until then, the world is being moved by men who were completely unprepared for their positions and are basically making it up as they go along. (Of course, many, many people are making it up as they go along...). I'm not sure if there any lessons to be learned from these observations, but maybe it's just a stark reminder that a man's reach cannot exceed his grasp.",

It seemd larger than usual that day, so I figured I should finally take a look. And in the process I remembered what I dislike about local flea markets: 90% of the stalls are selling some form of clothes (which I have no interest in browsing - maybe if these stalls sold something my size for once!) and maybe 9.9% are selling cheap knockoff toys (which might interest me if they were free or such) or cellphone accessories. And maybe, on a rare 0.1% occassion, a stall will have something I'm interested in browsing: used books.\r\n\r\nI like browsing books for sale. Never mind that I already have too many books to read already. Used book sales are not very common in Metro Manila. I mean, there's the big franchise stores in the mall like National Bookstore or Fully Booked or Powerbooks, but given that I alreayd have too many books to read and how frugal I am, I rarely buy from those stores these days (though I still do browse through them often). \r\n\r\nUsed books sales, especially of the random pop-up kind, are a different matter. It's a bit like treasure hunting in a way, where you're hoping toe be lucky enough to find a bargain (I suppose this is how people who like browsing for clothes feel like at these flea markets). \r\n\r\nUsed book sales aren't very common around here, sadly. There's Book Sale branches in the malls of course, but their selection often isn't very good. Yes, I'm picky too! I'm usually looking for stuff like science fiction, fantasy, or comics. Or maybe an interesting autobiography or nonfiction book - probably the best purchase I ever made at a Book Sale was getting a copy of The Rock Says, The Rock's autobiography for cheap (I still have that book around here somewhere). \r\n\r\nThere also used to be a small used book store called Chapter IX at a small commercial center near where I live. They had a very good selection, a lot of it sci-fi and fantasy. Their prices weren't super cheap though, so I didn't buy much from them. My copy of Dune came from there. Sadly it isn't there anymore. I think they're mostly just selling books online via Facebook now. Browsing through book pictures online doesn't feel the same as rummaging through stacks of used books - it feels more like intentional buying rather than the browsing I enjoy.\r\n\r\nThere's another used book store that I sometimes go to called Bookay-Ukay in Teacher's Village. It's okay - the selection is definitely better than Book Sale. They have some comics and sometimes video game guides too (I like those too!). I think I've bought at least one pocketbook from them and a couple of comics/guides. I'm not sure if they're still around - the last time I passed by there it was closed, but they seem to have weird hours so IDK.\r\n\r\nThe best used book sale I ever found in the Metro was this pop-up stall that I only saw at the Greenfield market near Shaw Boulevard. This was back when Geekfight was doing regular quiz nights on Fridays in that area. A number of stalls would be set up there around the Friday night entertainment. Most of the stalls would be food or clothing (as per usual) but there was always at least one stall, sometimes two, selling used books. They both had pretty good selections too, I ended up buying quite a bit from them. I remember buying a couple of Discworld books, some old-school CYOA and Heir to the Empire (the first Thrawn book) from there. Geekfight stopped doing their quiz nights there after a while though, and since I no longer work in Ortigas, I never really pass anywhere near that area anymore, so I don't know if those used book stalls are still a thing.\r\n\r\nI always keep an eye out for book stores, used or not, even when I'm travelling in another country. During my first night on my first trip abroad, I walked a few blocks around the neighborhood where I was staying and was happy to find a small hole-in-the-wall book store just a couple of streets away. Of course, all the books were in Chinese! During my Europe trip, I remember walking along the Seine in Paris and I came along a series of pop-up stalls in some kind of mini-flea market near the river side. Quite a few of them were selling old and/or used books, many of them French, some in English, and I think there were some Asterix comics in Italian I think. I didn't end up buying anything, but it was fun. I also remember finding quite a few used book stores in the Camden Market in London while I was there. \r\n\r\nAlso, travel tip: you can type \"book stores near me\" in Google Maps to see nearby book stores (or any other kind of stores I guess). I do this a lot.\r\n\r\nI wish book stores were more common around here, but I can understand why they aren't too popular. Books often aren't a high priority for the Filipino masses, given all the other challenges in life. I'm very lucky to have grown up with parents who not only instilled a love of reading in me, but also had the budget to buy me books all the time. Sadly, these days I don't read too many books anymore (I blame the internet). Hopefully that's something I can correct next year.",

I once articulated this as a life philosophy to a friend - that I preferred a life with periods of highs and lows, like a sine wave, instead of a simple and boring flat line.\r\n\r\nThis is why I often enjoy games like Scrabble or MTG. Basically competitive skill-intensive games that still have a significant element of random chance, so that the games while interesting, almost never play out the same way. For computer games, I really like the ones that have any sort of random/procedural generation - probably one of the reasons why I really latched onto Civilization and X-Com when I was young. \r\n\r\nThis is also why I probably couldn't thrive in any career that involves a lot of repetitiveness or doing the same thing day in and day out. I can't imagine working as something like a security guard or a cashier (aside from the low pay obviously). This is why programming is great for me a career - it's highly skill intensive and at the same time there's a lot of variance because you're almost never solving the same problem twice. And if you are encountering the same problems repeatedly, then you have a new problem to solve - how to stop those problems from repeating.\r\n\r\nLove of variance can be a double-edged sword though. The main problem is that it gives me difficulty in trying to do things that require consistent discipline or repeated practice - developing habits like regular exercise can be a challenge. This is why even in my daily walking, I dislike taking the same route too often. It is a problem to be overcome.",

I mean sure, a lot of it didn't make any sense, but it was like a love letter to DC fans. I actually consider myself more of a Marvel fan than DC, but I still loved it! I wrote a spoiler-free review over on the Tumblr.\r\n\r\nI found Better Call Saul on a couple of \"Best TV of 2018\" lists so I decided to catch up with it since it was on Netflix. I was actually two seasons behind. This series is great, and I really enjoy Bob Odenkirk's portrayal, but it might be just a bit overhyped for me. We already know where Jimmy/Saul, Mike, the Salamancas, and Gus Fring end up given Breaking Bad, so that kind of takes away a bit of tension. Still, it's a fine TV show. \r\n\r\nI also got caught up with The Ranch, which is a weird show for me to watch given how hillbilly it is, but I find the perspective strangely refreshing. Also, Elisha Cuthbert really helps. I was surprised that they had killed off Danny Masterson's character (oops spoilers), apparently it was a #MeToo thing or such.\r\n\r\nInto the Spider-Verse was great, especially for a fan of the comics. You can read my spoiler-free review on tumblr.\r\n\r\nI watched Aquaman with a friend at UPTC, my first time watching at the theaters there. I had low expectations, but the movie was a surprisingly fun spectacle. You can read my spoiler-free review on tumblr.\r\n\r\nAt home, I watched Incredibles 2 with the niece, who has a bad habit of spoiling things for movies she's already seen. To the tune of \"Oh, did you know Character is actually Villain?!?\". Still, the movie was nice, exceeded my expectations. It expanded the Incredibles' superhero universe and there was even some surprise Bob Odenkirk!\r\n\r\nWe also watched Solo: A Star Wars Story on Christmas eve (since we didn't get a Christmas Star Wars film this year). We didn't have time to finish it before we went to mass though, so I finished the movie myself a couple of days later. I had skipped watching this in the theater given the mediocre ratings, but now that I've seen it, that's a decision I've come to regret. It's a reasonable movie with a servicable plot, especially given it's basically meant to expound upon a couple of throwaway lines from the original trilogy. The plot even leaves some dangling threads that could have picked up in succeeding movies, had Disney not decided to scrap (at least for now) the Star Wars spinoff movies. The movie compares unfavorably to Rogue One, which had the far superior heist scheme. In both movies we expected many of the introduced characters to be killed off, but the Rogue One deaths were much better than the Solo ones. Still, it's an okay addition to the Star Wars universe. I read that it also has some tie-ins to the various animated series, which I'm not too familiar with. Maybe I'll get into those someday.",

Filipinos are well-known for celebrating the longest Christmas season, with decorations and Christmas songs starting to become common around September. The most well-known meme around this time is about the song Christmas in our Hearts by Jose Mari Chan, which is one of the songs malls often play during the season. Many memes leading up to December or even earlier imply Jose Mari Chan preparing to strike on unsuspecting Filipinos.\r\nTraffic in Metro Manila, already pretty terrible, often gets much worse in December. I usually take lots of days off (sometimes even the whole month) to avoid this. The malls are jam packed as well, same as the roads. It gets much better right after Christmas, in the week leading up to New Year. That week between Christmas and New Year is probably the second lightest week in the year traffic-wise (second only to whenever Holy Week is). \r\nA Filipino-only tradition are the so-called Simbang Gabi, a series of early morning or late-night masses that many Catholics try to complete from Dec 16 to Dec 24. I'm an RC, but I dislike going to these because there's always so many people. I don't think I've gone to one of these in around two decades. \r\nAn annoying thing, at least in Metro Manila, is the Metro Manila Film Festival. While I have nothing against Filipino films even though I don't watch them, the fact that they are given a monopoly during the last week of December means any big blockbuster foreign films often get pushed to January (we don't have Bumblebee yet for that reason), and smaller Christmas releases often just won't be shown in the country. It would be significantly less annoying if the MMFF actually included quality films instead of whatever hot garbage Vic Sotto and/or Vice Ganda are giving the public.\r\nPeople who live in subdivisions get an upsurge of roving bands of kids who sing Christmas carols (sometimes badly) somewhere between 6-9pm every night in December. They appear more often as Christmas day draws near. We rarely ever give them anything. The sheer volume is a problem. It's not like American Halloween where it's one night in a year, this is every night for a month. (Actually, some of these kids sometimes try this during Oct/Nov going \"Happy Halloween\" instead of \"Merry Christmas!\", but that's much rarer.) Sometimes even while I'm walking around the subdivision they'll come up to me saying \"Namamasko po!\" (only in the Philippines is Christmas a verb), which annoys me as it kind of smacks of mendicacy. Maybe it would be different if some of the kids' groups weren't obviously like they just randomly got together and decided to see if they could get some money from low effort carolling. We usually end up ignoring the doorbells around the time when there are carollers, but that seemed unwise. I suggested we just put a sign saying something to the effect of \"PATAWAD! BAWAL MANGAROLING!\" but I'm told that wasn't nice or something lol\r\nMost companies in Metro Manila hold some kind of Christmas party in December, so most events places are booked, good luck to anyone trying to arrange their Christmas party late. Common Christmas party fare include lechon, gift exchanges, raffles, and the dignity of new company employees \"required\" to render a performance number.\r\nI think (but don't have the statistics to back me up on this) that petty crime also has an uptick during December. Both times I've been the victim of pickpocketing were around this time. It makes sense - people are more desperate during Christmas, and the crowds make it easier for pickpockets.\r\nMost of these are from a middle-class Metro Manila experience of course, since that's what I know. Even the poorer families try to get into the spirit, with some even taking on debts just to be able to have a decent Christmas celebration, which for me is a bad idea.

And you know what? It's fine. Not everything goes according to plan. Unexpected things happen. People understand. We laugh about it and move on.\r\n\r\nI fall into this trap often. I try to tell myself that worry does nothing. If there's something you can do to make things better, then do it. Otherwise, why worry?\r\n\r\nIf you can't get past your overhtinking, I find that it sometimes helps to think about the worst-case scenario. You're already worrying about problematic things happening, so why not go all the way right? Often you'll find the worst-case scenario is something survivable, and it's so ridiculously out-of-left-field that the rest of the worries just fade away. \r\n\r\nLife is too short for worrying.",

(Yes, my bucket list items are that level lol)\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 1085123142467506176 }}\r\n\r\nWhen watching TV/movies, I was always fascinated by those scenes where people are in the park playing chess and I wanted to play chess in the park with strangers too. In hindsight, it makes more sense that people would actually be playing with people they knew, but the idea of playing chess with strangers seemed fun to me for some reason.\r\n\r\nSo the other day I was passing by the QC circle (as is my wont), and I saw a bunch of white-haired old men playing chess under some tent-like structure. There were four chess sets set up and two of the boards were occupied with ongoing games. I strolled over and started watching the games. One of the guys sitting at the other two tables asked me if I wanted to play, just some quick games. There were chess clocks too! So we could play timed games, 10 minutes each. They told me the sets belonged to one of the gentlemen currently playing, and he just asked for some small amount in coins for playing. \r\n\r\nAfter some mumbling that I'm very out of practice I pretended to reluctantly agree. We set up the clock and went at it.\r\n\r\nIt was true that I was out of practice. Most of my chess-playing days were back when I was in HS/college, though I did occasionally play when my old company had chess as a sportsfest event. (That didn't last too long because one of our employees was an actual competitive chess player, and another one was a varsity player in college, so I never got beyond the top 4...)\r\n\r\nFirst game I was black, and my openings were good enough, and we had a decent back and forth in the midgame, but I was behind in pawns and near the end game he forced a queen exchange and my king couldn't handle the pawns in time. I almost ran out of time on the chess clock too!\r\n\r\nI agreed to a second game, this time I was white and performed much worse. It was easier for me playing black and just reacting to what the opponent was doing, but as white I didn't have any kind of decent plan and all my attacks ended horribly until I fell to a knight fork attack that took out a rook, then got trapped in a situation where I had to give up the queen to avoid a checkmate. I had already run out the clock by that point, so I just quit.\r\n\r\nThey wanted to play some more, but it was late and dusk had fallen so I begged off and thanked them for the games. I gave the guy 15 pesos for the use of the sets, seemed fine. They invited me to play again if I see them there, apparently they do this often.\r\n\r\nI guess I would have felt much better if I had manage to win at least one game, but I walked away satisfied anyway. I'm not sure why I was so excited at the idea - since I do Magic tournaments, playing against strangers isn't new to me. I guess there's something about participating in an activity I don't do too often, and having strangers judge my plays, that made it a bit exciting. And in any case, it did make me think about playing chess online - is Yahoo chess still a thing? Lol. Well, I already have a lot of daily gaming habits, let's see if I can fit that in sometime.",

In fairness to old me, at that time the IDEs didn't support a real dark mode - only the editor area had the dark background and light text, while the rest of the application's chrome still sported the OS default (but you could change the OS default I believe).\r\n\r\nI'm not sure when it happened, but sometime over the next few years I had a change of heart and started defaulting to dark mode themes whenever possible, and not just for programming IDEs. I now have dark mode defaults for many apps like Twitter or Discord. I also tried adding a browser extension to default dark mode on all sites, but that didn't work out too well. \r\n\r\nI would guess that dark/night mode became more prevalent with the rise of smartphone/tablet usage, since many people use those devices even in bed with the lights out. I personally can still work with light mode apps, I just prefer the dark mode now, it's softer on the eyes and all.",

This advice means that for a recurring activity, once you get a streak or chain going, as much as possible you should avoid breaking the chain. So if your NYR is to exercise daily, you should try to avoid breaking that chain for as long as possible.\r\n\r\nIt helps if you're tracking how long your current streak is, either via a calendar or an app, or some other method. The longer the streak gets, the more incentivized you are not to drop the ball by breaking the chain. I mentioned this in my Duolingo post - I feel quite bad when I break a months-long streak in Duolingo.\r\n\r\nOf course, at some point you're going to fail, and the streak will break. We're only human after all, and we don't have to be on all the time. Failures happen, and that's okay. If the activity is important to you, it should be a simple matter to simply try again and start the chain over. This is of course, a point of weakness: at the time you break the chain, this is when you are most vulnerable to quitting. That's why you have to minimize breaking the chain.\r\n\r\nNot all NYRs or recurring activities have to go on forever though. Sometimes you just want to do 30-day challenges. Or maybe you want to try this activity for a while to see if it works out for you. No need to push yourself to continue with a chain that you find isn't worthwhile.",

Well, my first answer was that those are just things I find interesting and may look into, but that's not really an answer for the inspiration part.\r\n\r\nSoftware development is a very wide field, one where the amount of things you can learn increases daily, so it's almost impossible to keep up with everything. I think that having a natural tendency or curiosity towards learning new things is a distinct advantage in this industry. Having at least some passing familiarity with a wide range of technologies gives you more options in both job hunting and deciding on technical approaches. \r\n\r\nWhen interviewing developers, I often viewed it as a distinct advantage when a candidate invested their own time in trying out new tech. However, I realize that spending your own time to learn things on your own is another form of privilege that I have. Not all developers will have the free time or motivation to do that unless it was part of their work tasks. So insisting that developers should do this in their free time is a bit elitist to say the least. \r\n\r\nI read a blog post the other day saying it's actually beneficial for companies to pay for their employees to learn stuff during work time. Quote:\r\n\r\n Giving developers time to learn makes good business sense in a competitive world where attracting and retaining skilled people is an advantage in the marketplace.\r\n\r\nWhile this makes sense, the problem with this is that from experience, many companies are running their projects on very tight schedules, some often almost always behind schedule, which makes giving developers free time for self-improvement will often be unattractive to higher-ups. I know that in my previous jobs, the only way I could justify learning a new technology would be if it was required or important for a specific upcoming project. In a way, having the space to allow developers this privilege is in itself a privilege that not all companies can afford.\r\n\r\nSupposedly in the modern softeare industry, demand for developers is still high compared to supply so individuals should still have some leverage here and should vote with our feet. Younger or entry-level developers should ask companies about their policies for upskilling their employees and prefer those which give them more opportunities, and disfavor companies where the devs' technical knowledge tends to stagnate, so that companies will learn to adjust. Such factors can only be good for their career in the long run.",

So if you have a NYR like \"quit smoking\", you should choose a \"good habit\" to replace the \"bad habit\" of smoking with. Maybe every time you get an urge to smoke, you pick up a book instead and start reading? Just a suggestion.\r\n\r\n(The rest of Mandino's book consists mostly of recommended self-affirmations, which is the \"good habit\" he recommends to improve your life.)",

The distributed VCS seemed ideal for their situation - they had a very small in-house dev team managing contributions from external subcontractors. The main rationale was that their process of merging contributions from the external developers was extremely complicated and often resulted in conflicts that were challenging to merge. Before this, I hadn't actually used Git too deeply myself (aside from cloning stuff from Github), and especially not in a team setting, so the training one of our other engineers gave them was a good opportunity for me to become familiar with Git as well. During the succeeding months we guided them through the first few pull requests and merges; their repository structure and build process was quite complicated so it took us a while to iron out the kinks. There was often some difficulty when merging PRs from old forks and so on. I mostly let our other engineer who had more Git experience handle any merging. Sometimes I wondered about whether the transition was really worth it for the client, but it all seemed to end up okay.\r\n\r\nI was reminded of this because I recently tried the whole workflow of fork and change code and pull request and merge with upstream to resolve conflicts in a larger, non-trivial project. (I don't count the few PRs I did for Hacktoberfest last year, as those were relatively simple). This one was a whole new submodule that I had to merge into the main repository, so there were a lot of changes on my end. I wasn't expecting any conflicts though, because I was only adding new stuff and not modifying existing code. So I tried to make my PR without merging from upstream, not expecting any issues. Unfortunately, it turns out some CR/LF shenanigans between my Windows machine and the repo meant one of my commits had more \"lines changed\" than I intended, resulting in a merge conflict. Fortunately, it was easy to simply merge from upstream and resolve the offending files manually. Didn't take me more than 5 minutes to fix the issue.\r\n\r\nMy experience with this was a bit amazing in retrospect. Mostly because for a large part of my career to as recently as four years ago, I worked with CVS as a version control system, which is ancient by modern standards. I remember during my first project, we had three branches: DEV, UAT and PROD. And moving changes from any given branch to another was a pain, each file had to be manually re-applied to the other branch. So my instinct has always been to dread any large-scale merge (something I have to unlearn apparently). \r\n\r\nGit has a few other advantages of course. One of my favorites is being able to address specific commits individually by hash, and see the file changes and so on. When we were using CVS if you wanted to rollback to a specific change, you had to have the foresight to have tagged that change so that you can check it out again. And CVS for us was always very slow for larger projects with thousands of files, leading to annoyingly long build cycles and wait times. Git seems to be a lot more performant.\r\n\r\nI hold no ill will towards my old company for making me use CVS all those years. When I started out it was a reasonable choice, but as time went by better options simply became available, and like many companies it was difficult to leave entrenched systems. I did propose the use of distributed VCS over the years; at first Mercurial and later Git as well, but there was never a good time to migrate without being overly disruptive (this happens when Everything Is Urgent). Probably if I had gotten in on a larger project on the ground floor, but the last time I had a chance for that was around 2007 I think, when Git was still in infancy. Still, I heard from people still there that they're already in migrating to Git, so good for them (even though they waited til I was gone!).",

That's why things like phone interviews where people ask you to explain what the volatile keyword means in order to test whether you're really a Java expert are BS. (I have a Java certification and while I'm sure I knew the answer to that at some point, if I needed it today, it would certainly come in the form of a search result.). \r\n\r\nSoftware development is a difficult field, and it can sometimes be intimidating to work with more senior developers or ask them questions or show them your code. But it gets easier when you realize not everyone knows everything all the time, and that not even the most senior people know everything. And that this ability to seek out advice and yes, even stackoverflow results, is part of the skillset you need to be developing.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the field is that we are almost always encountering new situations and new problems and new challenges (well, either that or be bored doing something irrelevant). That means a lot of the time when we are working on something worthwhile, we are figuring out things as we go.",

For me, the term invokes the names Frank and Joe before the Matt and Jeff of WWE fame. We had a fairly wide collection of the blue-hardcovered books of those days. And I believe I made the effort to read every single book in that particular series, through borrowing and such. I think I was successful, but I can't be sure.\r\n\r\nIn any case , that meant this article piqued my interest:\r\n\r\n The Knotty Nostalgia of the Hardy Boys Series\r\n Why one writer still reads the wildly popular books with a mixture of love and disappointment, 60 years after they were revised to remove racist content\r\n\r\nReading the series as a child, I never felt any serious racist undertones, probably because the versions I had were already torn down. Or more likely, because as a child I didn't have any real concept of race. Sure, Frank and Joe were depicted as white kids on the book covers, but that meant nothing to this brown kid from Asia, even though I was certainly aware of caucasians and blacks by then. As far as I was concerned, I could have been mixed in with their crowd with no issues. I even remember specifically the Hidden Harbor book mentioned in the article, there were some characters who spoke with a southern accent, I guess they were meant to be black? But I never imagined them in my head as any different from their northern visitors. (There was this one character named Grover who in my head looked like a blue muppet...)\r\n\r\nOur copies of those Hardy Boys books are long gone, but like the article's author I still look back at them with a tinge of nostalgia. I did learn a lot from those books, from vocabulary to American culture to different kinds of hobbies. I think the main charm of the Chet Morton character mentioned in the article is that with every book he always had a new, different hobby, and in that way the teenage readers could learn about some new field or possible area of interest. Later on, we also encountered softbound books of a later Hardy Boys series The Hardy Boys Casefiles, which was more dark (one of the character's girlfriends got killed), but they lacked the charm, templating or formularity of the old ones, and we never got more than a few books from that series.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if these books are still available locally, I don't recall seeing them in bookstores. I think they would still be pretty good reading for young boys these days - the Hardy Boys seem like they'd be good role models, they're smart, they do well in school, they're friendly and accepting and they obey the law and perhaps most importantly, they exhibit a sense of curiosity and adventure about the world around them, something many kids these days seem to lose as they grow up.",

The initialism is a bit unwieldy; it stands for \"If this, then that\". It basically provides a way to \"glue\" different services and APIs together so you can set up some kind of automation. You set up rules with conditions and specify what to do when those conditions are met.\r\n\r\nOne of my main uses for it was for social media cross-posting. Some examples are:\r\n\r\nwhenever I tweet, cross-post to Facebook*\r\nwhenever I post to Instagram, cross-post to Twitter and Tumblr\r\nwhenever I publish a new blog post, send the link to Facebook* and Twitter\r\nwhenever I publish an image post on Tumblr, tweet the image\r\nwhenever I post on Mastodon, cross-post to Twitter\r\nwhenever I save a new link on Pocket, cross-post to Twitter\r\n\r\nThe ones marked * are unfortunately no longer working since Facebook changed their API to prevent automated publishing. My blog posts now cross-post to a Facebook page instead. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, since I like to archive/backup everything and track my data, IFTTT is also helpful with that. I use it to:\r\n\r\nsave all SMS messages to a Google doc\r\nsave tagged FB photos to Dropbox\r\nsave my daily Fitbit activity to a spreadsheet\r\n\r\nI'm only using a very small subset of the functionality too. There's a lot more apps and services that it can hook up to, and they always recommend new \"recipes\" or \"applets\" that you might find useful. I think many of their services might be limited to US people though, especially the ones related to smart appliances and such. I wish there were some more advanced output capabilities though. Like, I went to publish a custom API endpoint to accept output from IFTTT, so I can route inputs from different services to my own systems for tracking/archiving/analysis. But maybe that's too much to ask for a general-purpose service. Still, the fact that IFTTT exists is super helpful because otherwise I might consider writing my own APIs for the above functionality. Nowadays when I want to do some sort of service glue I first ask myself \"Can I do this using IFTTT?\"",

Every human needs a v extensive library not clean, boring shelves\r\n \r\n — Anakana Schofield (@AnakanaSchofiel) January 3, 2019\r\n\r\nMaybe it's missing the point of decluterring though. The idea is getting rid of things that \"don't give you joy\", so if having books give you joy, then obviously you keep your books, regardless of whether those books are challenging, difficult, depressing etc. Maybe the point is that you have to be constantly re-evaluating whether the hoarding is a positive spin in your life. (And I say this as someone who has a bunch of books waiting to be read just lying around his room.)\r\n\r\nI think this kind of decluttering and minimalism doesn't just apply to possessions though. You should also be looking to give up things like friends, relationships, habits, routines, traditions, and so on, that are no longer net positives or \"bringing you joy\".\r\n\r\nThere's sometimes a bigger picture to look at too. Maybe a specific thing doesn't \"bring you joy\", but your gradnchildren really like seeing that thing when they visit, and seeing them happy brings you joy, so you keep it anyway. \r\n\r\nMaybe the bigger lesson is to not rely on someone from a Netflix show to tell you how to live your life. It's good to take advice from other people, but everyone has different tastes and different things can bring you joy. You decide what brings you joy.",

Last year I posted some year-end statistics. That seems like a good way to recap the year, so let's do it again. Random statistics from 2018:\r\n\r\nWork, Learning and Self Improvement:\r\n\r\n  Hours worked: 1,163 (up around 50% from last year)\r\n  Programming languages/frameworks learned: I'll say 4. I'm counting: \r\n      C++ which I revisited this year after more than a decade of not using it\r\n      Go, which I used for the templating in the Hugo blog\r\n      Flask, which I had dabbled in before but only used in a full-scale project this year\r\n      Laravel, which I also used in a couple of projects this year\r\n  Books read: 4. Sad. Down 5 from last year. Must finish more books in 2019.\r\n  Duolingo streak: 92 days (Hooray!)\r\n\r\nWriting and Social media:\r\n\r\n  Facebook status updates: 1093, down from 1463 last year, that's a good sign I think. Last year I measured my FB activity using the \"facebook report\" on Wolfram Alpha, but this seems to no longer work, probably due to the recent FB API changes. This time I instead downloaded an archive of my FB activity and counted the \"statusupdates\" from yourposts.json using a python script.\r\n  Instagram posts: 21 (Down 100 from last year. I'm not sure if I'll continue using it too much...)\r\n  Tweets: 1566 (up from 1484 last year)\r\n  Answers written on Quora: 3. Down by 14. I may be winding down my Quora participation anyway.\r\n  104 blog posts (including this one; total of 818 up 59 from last year)\r\n  0 words written for Nanowrimo (hopefully I can have another go next year)\r\n  0 sketches submitted to r/sketchdaily (I might try to pick this up again this year)\r\n\r\nGaming:\r\n\r\n  Games purchased (not including any I got for free for some reason): 37, not including DLC, most of it from my three-month experiment with Humble Montly. This is a huge improvement from last year's 67. In fact, my gaming spend for 2018 was 1/3 what it was in 2017, so huge props to me lol. Breakdown: 4 steam, 34 humble, 3 dlc)\r\n  Games \"finished\" (story/campaign completed OR achievement complete): 10, up 2 from 2017! The list: \r\n      Twilight Princess HD (WiiU) \r\n      Eternal\r\n      Skyrim\r\n      Ni No Kuni (PS3)\r\n      Spider-man (PS4)\r\n      Invisible Inc\r\n      Orwell\r\n      Tomb Raider\r\n      Life is Strange\r\n      Papers Please (not yet achievement complete, but close)\r\n      Final Fantasy XII: Zodiac Age (I had this on last year's list as 95% done, I decided to finish it a few hours before 2019 lol)\r\n  Best Eternal Rank: Ranked Master (363), Draft Master\r\n  Best MTGA Rank: Gold 4\r\n  Average points per turn in Words with Friends: 26 (down from 27)\r\n  MTG GPs attended: 0, but I did do an RTPQ in KL this year. Most likely 0 again for 2019.\r\n\r\nOthers:\r\n\r\n  Fitbit activity: 1,820,053 steps, 1,419.64 km walked\r\n  Donuts eaten: 4 (down from 12 last year!)\r\n  Other countries visited: 0, as predicted. Likely 0 in 2019 as well.\r\n  Baptisms attended: 1 (same as last year)\r\n  Weddings attended: 0 (down 1)\r\n  Wakes attended: 0 (thankfully)\r\n  Things watched on Netflix: 789 (Up 69 from last year)\r\n  Quiz nights attended: 8 (we won once) - down from 3/19 in 2017\r\n  Uber trips: 18 (down from 64 in 2017, RIP uber)\r\n  Grab trips: 101 (!)\r\n  Times I won the lotto: 0 (I kind of regret putting this number two years ago, as now I can't remove it without looking suspicious)\r\n  Bears defeated in single combat: 0\r\n\r\nOverall, the year was a lot busier than 2017, since I took on a lot more work, especially in the middle half of the year. I'm looking to lighten the load a bit in 2019, we'll see.",

The story of the game itself is interesting, as Pope was more or less a one-man team, doing the design, code, music and art for the game himself.\r\n\r\nIf you're not familiar, the game places you in the role of a border inspector in a fictional 1980s totalitarian state called Arstotzka, a thinly-veiled parallel to communist East Germany and similar nations. As border inspector, you're charged with inspecting the documents of people who want to enter the country, and your meagre salary depends on how many people you are able to correctly process in one day. The day-to-day gameplay tension is between your need to process as many people as possible so that you have enough to pay rent and feed your family; vs your desire to avoid making mistakes. Mistakes often come in the form of allowing entrants with discrepancies in their papers to pass through unchallenged, and making multiple mistakes in the same day is painful for your salary and endangers your family members. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gameplay is mostly attention to detail. At the start of a run, you only have one or two documents per entrant and it's relatively simply: make sure their passport photo matches their appearance, make sure the passport isn't expired, make sure it has a valid issuing city, etc. As the days pass, the Arstotzkan bureaucracy imposes more requirements upon entrants, making your job considerably harder. Towards the end of the story mode's 31-day period you'll be checking 4-6 different documents per entrant, making sure all their papers are valid and all the info on each document matches the others and so on. It has an element of tediousness reflecting the actual job you are doing, and yet is strangely engaging.\r\n\r\nThe story mode is fairly good, and it finds you dealing with challenges like smugglers, refugees, bribes, forged documents, a nosy press, and even a group of rebels plotting to take down the fascist Arstotzkan government, and the occasional terrorist attack on your booth. There are a number of endings, you can choose to play it straight, do your job as ordered and not support any criminal elements at all, and you and your family will live your same life in Arstotzka. Or you can risk everything by helping dissidents and refugees and criminals, and in the end you have to find a way to escape your homeland with your family. Or you could make the wrong decision at some points, and the game will end earlier than expected. Many of the noncritical entrants are randomly-generated I think, but the story-critical ones are preordained to come at specific times.\r\n\r\nThe nation-state of Arstotzka is surprisingly efficient in some ways - if you make a mistake such as letting through an entrant with an invalid passport, you are immediately issued a citation (something you come to dread in the game). So somehow the bureaucracy is able to know what is happening in your booth - yet they are unable to detect your interactions with the dissidents and some of the criminals. \r\n\r\nAchievements: The game provides an autosave each day you complete, and you can resume from any of the previous days, so that's helpful for achievement hunting. I didn't bother going for achievement completion yet though, as the remaining ones I missed seem to require too much backtracking, and there's other games to play.\r\n\r\nThe game was a good buy, and perhaps even still a bit relevant in the modern world, despite it's 1980s setting.",

It got a bit of press a while back about how it was a nice place to hang out (for a government institution at least), so I had a todo list item about checking it out. \r\n\r\nWell, last week I did! I passed by on a weekday afternoon about 4pm after running some errands. The library was open until 7pm, so the timing was fine. I went up to the building and the guard asked me what my business was and I said I just wanted to check out the library. He told me that bags weren't allowed inside so I had to go to the baggage counter. Oops, luckily I only had my sling bag and not the full backpack I usually had when carrying a laptop. I left my sling bag at the counter and went inside.\r\n\r\nThe space wasn't as large as I thought it would be - the pictures on the website made it seem a bit larger in my imagination. The tables and seats were maybe 75% full, mostly with students and library staff. The main library area was in the first floor. Second floor seemed to be some offices and an outdoor cafe, I didn't explore the second floor too much. I walked around the ground floor rooms for a bit, browsing the shelves. Aside from the main area, there was a separate room specialized for Philippine history and such, a room for kids' books, a \"puppeteers room\", and a smaller round room with periodicals and such. \r\n\r\nThere was also a small section for fiction books in the main area; the selection was decent, mostly mainstream titles like Hunger Games, some Robert Ludlum, a few sci-fi/fantasy titles, and so on. For the reference materials, it was about what you'd expect from a public library - most of it was dated and donated. The tech/comptuers sections had the sort of obsolete computer books you'd find at book sale - like \"How to use Microsoft Access 95\", that kind of thing. There were The World is Flat by Friedman, and Obama's book about hope or such. \r\n\r\nSomeone showed me how to use one of the computer kiosks to search the library's catalog, and I was told it should be accessible via the website, so that seems fine. If you wanted to know whether they had a particular book, you could just check the website first. Also, the catalog said they had some Thor comics, but they were in the children's corner, and I didn't feel like going in there lol. I also tried connecting my iPad to the local wifi, but the internet wasn't very good.\r\n\r\nI came away not too impressed with the library. I'm not sure what I was expecting. I guess I was kind of hoping to see if it was a good place to hang out, maybe if I was stranded near city hall due to traffic or waiting around in that area for something. It seems like a fairly good place for students from nearby schools though, especially those with no internet access at home. At least my curiosity was sated and I managed to tick an item off my todo list!",

Although my college education was in C, that was a completely different animal. I did self-study C++ for a bit back even before I was working, mostly because I was interested in game development even back then. I remember trying some OpenGL and/or DirectX stuff back with good old Borland Turbo-C++ during the DOS days and using the Dev-C++ IDE when I shifted to Windows. Professionally, I think there was at least one project where I had to work on a Windows-based application using C++ on Visual Studio 6 (before all this .NET nonsense), but for the life of me I can't even remember which project it was anymore. I do remember struggling more with the compiler and the IDE and the layouting of Windows components more than the language itself. And even then, I mostly used the language as an extension of C and not really taking advantage of the more advanced features.\r\n\r\nAlthough I knew about the language features in theory, I didn't have much experience back then with using features like templates, generic types, or the STL. That was remedied this year when we had a project that required us to adapt an existing open source C++ project and modify it for our needs. This was a full blown project, somewhere in the neighborhood of 175 kloc, and it involved complex stuff like cryptography, encryption, signing, networking, and so on. I didn't even know about the Boost library back then. A huge challenge for me at that time, given my little to no C++ experience. Luckily it was a service process that we planned to compile and deploy on Linux, so at least we didn't need to worry about Windows and UI shenanigans.\r\n\r\nOne of our senior developers (who was not available full-time for the project) did have C++ experience though, and he used to train new hires in C++ at his old company. So he dug out some of his old training slides and gave us a C++ refresher/crash course in the span of an afternoon. A bit too much info crammed into too little time, but still informative. Especially for me, since it's been so long since I touched the language, the slides reminded me of a few things I had already forgotten.\r\n\r\nSome notes:\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 1035019095287189504 }}\r\n\r\nhaving worked almost exclusively with dynamic languages the past few years, I haven't had the chance of use the old XKCD \"compiling\" excuse in a while. When we first tried compiling the project, we were seeing build times in the 10-15 minutes range, which was worrying for our coding cycles. And since we were \"relearning\" C++, as it were, we were bound to have more iterations than normal. Luckily we found that the build process tended to be a bit faster on succeeding builds, I guess it does some kind of incremental build? Later on, compiling would take around 2-3 minutes.\r\nmakefiles are something I've never had to deal with before (that sort of thing used to be handled by an IDE during my last go-around with C++). But I had to figure them out early on in this project, otherwise we couldn't add our own new files to the codebase!\r\nI still don't fully understand linking, but we eventually figured out where to correctly place our files so that we wouldn't have any referential errors during linking. (Figuring this out also sped up the build process a bit.)\r\nAs I mentioned, I didn't have much experience with C++ features like templates and generic types, so one of the challenges we faced early on was making heads or tails of the usage of this third party library called JSON Spirit, which was used for representing JSON objects. The library uses a lot of generics and templates and typedefs, so it took a bunch of code tracing and a bit of trial and error for us to get the hang of it.\r\none thing we discovered early on was that the use of deeply-nested templates and generic types led to a lot of quite obtuse error messages, a bit of a challenge for us who didn't have much C++ experience. This problem is succinctly described in the following tweet:\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 1002648636516282368 }}\r\n\r\nSo there were a lot of challenges along the way, but this is fairly typical for developers coming into a project with an existing large codebase. And on the upside (my usual upside), I learned a lot, and I felt like a C++ genius a few weeks in. When you climb a learning curve quickly, it can make you feel amazing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the end I think we did pull it off and were able to implement and integrate the needed changes well, without any major issues. Given C's challenges with memory management and so on, I was kind of expecting we would encounter things like crashes, memory leaks, and such, but it turns out using the STL and Boost largely alleviates that problem. The project is still ongoing and has a bunch of requirements-related issues, but I think the C++ side turned out relatively well. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll have much use for C++ knowledge outside of this project, the language isn't really appropriate for the sort of personal projects I like to take on. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]: https://www.bloodshed.net/dev/devcpp.html\r\n[2]: https://xkcd.com/303/\r\n[3]: https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/20027/JSON-Spirit-A-C-JSON-Parser-Generator-Implemented",

Tt felt like a pefect opportunity to reconstruct that old version and also capture an image of the current version for posterity's sake. I got the HTML for the old version from the Wayback Machine, cleaned it up a bit and had the static files point to the right place. The top menu probably shouldn't look like that, but IDK how to fix it and didn't bother. For developer nostalgia/archive purposes I also uploaded the old Django 1.1.3-powered source code for the site back then over at Github, without the static files unfortunately.\r\n\r\nAnyway, here's the screenshots!\r\n\r\n2009:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2019:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis post was partially inspired by this.",

So every time I would get a cold again, it would be a new mutation. At some point I wondered how many of all possible mutations I had already acquired, given that I kept getting the cold so often.\r\n\r\nI don't think there's a lesson to be learned here.

The thing about being a solution architect is that there isn't really a clear definition of the role, what it involves, or the scope of responsibility. I suppose it depends largely on the organization and the project. The role mostly involves making techical decisions on a larger scale, like project-wide or organization-wide, rather than on the micro day-to-day technical decisions involved in a typical software development involves. These decisions can encompass not just coding, but also requirements gathering, application design, database design, modelling, testing methodology, processes, deployment, and so on. \r\n\r\nThis is actually pretty much what I was doing during my last full-time job anyway. I was basically involved in technical decision-making at all levels. So there's not much change, except that now there's a formal name/title to the role.\r\n\r\nDespite that role, in my past job I still insisted on taking on some of the coding work myself, typically the more difficult ones. I think it's important as a technical person to maintain some familiarity with the low-level coding details, even when you're transitioning to higher-level work like management or architectural work. (Also, I still enjoy the vagaries of day-to-day coding.)\r\n\r\nFor a solution architect in particular, it helps to be familiar with a wide array of technologies, since it informs your technical recommendations. You won't always get such exposure through official projects either, so it helps to be interested in these things on your own so you can read up or try them out in your spare time. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, the term \"solution architect\" has been increasing in usage over the past few years, if Google Trends is any indication:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(I originally tried Google Trend's embed option, but the embedded chart kept crashing my browser tab, so now you get a screen capture instead)\r\n\r\nIf you'd asked me five years ago I would have said such a role was within the scope of a senior engineer or technical lead. I guess as time goes on, the role becomes more distinct and formalized? At this point, I think the concept might still be a bit too nebulous for anyone to really specialize in it though.",

His series \"Boss Keys\" does a deep dive into Zelda dungeons and analyzes them based on criteria like linearity. His level design analyses are strongly based on systems and gameplay and how they affect the player experience. Good stuff.\r\n\r\nEmGo is a Transformers toy reviewer that I watch sometimes. I don't buy too many Transformers toys, and watching the toy reviews helps me hold back on buying. There's a bunch of such channels and EmGo is one of the more popular ones. He has a particular style of humor that may or may not appeal to everyone, but I like him.",

It helps that I really like the field as well. I try to make sure I study or learn at least one new programming language or framework every year (though I am willing to stretch that definition as needed). Here's a list of tech I'm looking at learning in 2019:\r\n\r\nRust or Golang. Between Python and JS, the last few years for me have been mostly focused on dynamically-typed languages that don't require precompilation. With my recent revisit of C++, I'm a bit interested in checking out a new statically-typed compiled language. Rust and Golang or the primary candidates here, I'll probably toy around with both to see which one I like better. The problem here is that I typically do web-based programs, so finding a project where it would be worth using one of these might be challenging.\r\nSwift. Since I recently bought a Macbook Air, that opens up the possibility of trying out Swift. I was involved in a mobile project when Swift came out and found it interesting when I was first going through the documentation - maybe because I thought Objective-C was a hot mess (or at least our codebase was back then). I never did get a chance to try it out, so maybe I will this year - if I find an appropriate mobile app to work on.\r\nKotlin is to Java and the JVM as Swift is to Objective-C and iOS. It's young, but as a JVM language it has direct interoperability with Java programs, and it's supposedly a first-class language nowadays for Android development. If I do decide to work on a native mobile app, Kotlin is a prime choice for the Android version. (Assuming I'm willing to dive back into the JVM ecosystem...)\r\nCSS Grid. I'll be the first to admin I'm a bit behind on frontend practices; my default layout framework is still Twitter's Bootstrap. If I get the chance, I'll do some of my personal web projects using CSS grid.\r\nVue.js. Speaking of frontends, I never got too deep into the current crop of frontend frameworks. Funny story, we were meeting with a database vendor to discuss solution options for a client and I mentioned I had already built a small prototype web application using their product. They asked me what framework I was using on the frontend and when I told them I wasn't using any, I was told that was \"hardcore\". While I do think it's helpful for full-stack web developers to be familiar with vanilla JS, I am interested in trying out at least one of the three prevalent frontend frameworks - Vue, React, and Angular. I have kind of tried React a bit with React Native, but at this moment, I'm leaning more towards Vue.\r\nMachine Learning. Specifically, I want to try out some text generation using recurrent neural networks, like those posts where people generate screenplays etc. I'm not too conversant with the theory, but reading some examples and tutorials I think this is something doable. Just need a reasonable corpus of texts to work with...\r\nTDD. Yup, test-driven development. I'm way behind the curve on this one. I understand the theory and the benefits, but I've never been in the position to have TDD in my projects. It's difficult sometimes to get management buy-in. At my past job, all of the testing was still manual. I've dabbled in TDD a bit, tried out some frameworks, but never full-scale in one of my projects. Maybe I'll try to write some tests for one of my side projects this year.\r\n\r\nThat's it. I think it's quite a lot actually. I'll review this post towards the end of the year to see which of these I end up doing. Or maybe I'll get into a freelance project that involves something new not on this list, who knows? \r\n\r\nWhat about you, what's your list for 2019?",

This is a bit uncommon I guess, so it makes me a bit of a nerd. Luckily nerds are cool now, or something. Okay, this is super positive I guess.\r\nbeing argumentative. I love a good debate. However, since the 2016 election season, I've cut back on this significantly. It's only fun if the debaters aren't fanatics and understand that the goal of debate isn't victory, but progress\r\nfollowing at least one person on social media who I disagree with. Like, there's this guy I follow on Twitter, an American expat living in the PH, and he's so pro-Trump and pro-guns and so on. He is anti-Duterte though, which I find kind of fascinating. I also have a token pro-Duterte friend I still have unmuted on Facebook. It helps to get an occasional glimpse of what \"the other side\" is thinking. Maybe not too much though, and definitely avoid anyone too toxic.\r\ncomplaining about things. There are people who say you should avoid being so negative, but sometimes complaining about things can be cathartic. Also, if we didn't voice disapproval about things going on in society, how would politicians know how to pivot? Complaining can sometimes be unreasonable, but all progress depends on the unreasonable man\r\ndiving into the comment section. Oh boy. Someone posted an article and warned not to go into the comments because they're toxic, and I kind of take that as an invitation. It's not advisable to do this all the time (you might get cancer), but sometimes I'll dive in just to see how ridiculous humans are\r\n\r\nActually, some of these might be worth blog posts on their own.

I used to pretty hyped for superhero movie trailers, but I haven't bother watching this one yet. MCU still has two more movies coming out before this one, and I'm already hyped enough for those, I don't think I have hype to spare for a third one.\r\n\r\nMy brother was complaining to me about the trailer, saying he was spoiled about some elements. Specifically, he wasn't aware that [actor] was in the movie playing [villain]. I keep up with comic book news, so that wasn't news for me, but I can see how disappointing it might be. Also, this seems to be typical - I check the first trailer for Spider-Man Homecoming and it did show Michael Keaton's Vulture. It's hard to avoid the villain info, few people consider it a spoiler, it's usually right there in the IMDB page.\r\n\r\nI do think that trailers these days show too much though. During the past few years, I've been avoiding watching any trailer beyond the first one that comes out. Although given that I follow comic book news, it's hard to avoid spoilers from succeeding trailer. Starting with the new Spider-Man I'm considering not watching any trailers at all (at least until I'm forced to watch one before an actual movie).\r\n\r\nIt might also be a problem with these comic book movies that they come from an established IP - so someone familiar with the source material like me basically already has an idea of what stuff might happen. The title alone of Avengers Infinity War gave me an idea of what happens in the movie after all.\r\n\r\nI think the perfect trailer for a completely new franchise gives you a taste of what's to come without giving you details of the major conflict and so on. The Captain Marvel and Shazam trailers have been pretty good in this regard.\r\n\r\nFor a sequel, the perfect trailer for me would be the first trailer for Avengers: Endgame, which basically acted as a \"story so far\", giving no new info that we didn't know from Infinity War. Other than the actual movie's title at least, which I had been anticipating for a long time.",

Here's my spoiler-free review. \r\n\r\nAs the link says, I've been a big fan of Transformers since I was a kid, so I thought I'd talk about that for a bit. The 1980s cartoon obviously, though I think only the first two seasons of that aired on local TV. I had quite a few G1 toys as well, though I think some of them may have been Chinese knockoffs. I remember I had an Optimus Prime, a Megatron (yes, the walther ppk with the robot mode with super thin legs), a small Powerglide, something like 3 out of 5 Aerialbots (no Silverbolt!), and so on. During their first trip to the US, my parents bought me a Metroplex, which was huge, that thing brought me so much joy and playtime. So much playtime that at some point I broke the toy at the hip. D:\r\n\r\nAnother favorite was a G1 Sixshot! Shown in this picture:\r\n\r\n\r\nThat toy was borrowed by a kid I knew from the school bus who lived nearby and he never gave it back! I haven't forgiven him to this day lol.\r\n\r\nI didn't actually have a very large TF toy collection when I was a kid. I know buying the toys back then must've been quite expensive, so understandably my folks only got me Transformers on special occasions. Even now as an adult with disposable income I find Transformers toys to be a bit pricey, so I fully understand!\r\n\r\nWhat I really got into and had a large collection of was the Marvel Transformers comics series. I remember I had the entire 80-issue Marvel run, plus the Headmasters and Universe limited series. It was the first comic series I really followed, I would eagerly look forward to buying the next issue every month. The stories were a lot more compelling and had a lot more continuity than just watching the cartoon. The stories were a lot more complex - in the cartoons, the Autobots were recognized by humans as heroes and the Decepticons as villains. While in the comics one of the main plot points was the humans mistrusting all transformers. Sadly, I have no idea what happened to my collection D:\r\n\r\nIn modern times though, I have also seriously enjoyed IDW's Transformers line of comics, which had a much more space/Cybertron focus. Freed from the need to sell new toylines every so often, the IDW line was able to give better characterization to the Transformers and had such great writing, especially towards the end. This continuity recently ended and they're starting up a new one I'm looking forward to this March.\r\n\r\nRecently over the past five years or so, I started buying a few modern Transformers toys as well. I'm not a big collector or anything, so I only buy one  every so often, preferably when they're on discount/sale, and only the smaller ones. It's fun seeing how they've updated modern toys to have a lot more articulation and so on. I mostly have them standing on my desk.\r\n\r\n{{ instagram BXQZGQtgNYJ }}\r\n\r\n{{ instagram BZ6ML5jApww }}\r\n\r\n{{ instagram Bsmx_nfh8zF }}\r\n\r\nTransformers was my first realy fandom, and something I'll probably never get over, no matter how old I get. I have a couple of nephews, when they've grown up a bit, I plan to be that uncle who always gifts them Transformers, to set up the next generation of robot fans. Despite my lack of love for the Bayverse series of films, I am grateful that those movies led a resurgence in their popularity, leading to more modern-day comics, toys and animated series as well, so even the young'uns will be able more... much more than meets the eye!",

I'm sure it bothers other people too, but it annoys me a bit disproportionately. I'm an introvert by nature so every unexpected interaction -- even just the effort to shake my head at whatever they're handing out -- takes away from my precious pool of socializing points. In addition to those people trying to flag you down as you walk about the mall, I also dislike it when salespeople in a store approach me unsolicited while I'm browsing, offering their help. If I need help, I'll ask for it! If I'm interested in what your stall has, I'll approach the stall myself! \r\n\r\nIt's also probably because most of the time if I'm walking around in a mall, I have a specific purpose in mind, whether just to get from point A to point B, or to go to X store to buy Y thing, or trying to catch up on daily walking. Sometimes I'll be in a \"exploring\" mode, and will probably be more amenable to that kind of thing, but that's a bit rare.\r\n\r\nI understand of course that people need to make a living and that stuff needs to be told and there are actually people who could use help or might be interested in that condo flier. I wish there was some way to \"opt out\" of unsolicited marketing in real life. Maybe some sort of statement shirt I could wear that says \"Strangers: Don't talk to me unless I talk to you.\" Since there's not, I just try to avoid contact and maybe have a scary expression on my face. It rarely works though.",

Pretty decent soft reboot, read my spoiler-free review over on the Tumblr\r\n\r\nThe first half of Young Justice Outsiders is out, and it's pretty good. Focus is back on a smaller group after the larger team in YJ season 2. A few new characters are introduced and I learned about a couple of DC heroes I wasn't familiar with before. Probably still the best animated superhero show to date.\r\n\r\nOn the Netflix side, season 2 of Punisher is out as well. I finished watching it but didn't bother posting a spoiler-free review this time. It was okay, but I don't have much commentary. Not as strikingly good as the first one was, but pretty decent. It feels weird now watching these shows knowing they are likely to end soon.\r\n\r\nSeason 2 of Star Trek Discovery has also started! Only two episodes in so far, but still very good. Feels a lot more classic Trek than the previous season, and a much lighter tone, not just because their captain isn't afraid of the light anymore.\r\n\r\nMy Netflix history also says I watched Bird Box, which became a bit viral early this month for some reason, but that was just my niece making my mom watch it with her, even after I warned her she would get scared (she did).",

He says:\r\n\r\n \"Look, from what we've seen, when planets first achieve space travel and they venture out into the galaxy and discover that they're just one single species among a vast diversity of lifeforms, they usually react in one of two ways: they embrace and adapt to the fact that they're no longer the center of the universe, or they ratchet up their xenophobia. ... I know fear when I see it. You're afraid to face the fact that your superiority may just be a comforting myth.\"\r\n\r\nShows like The Orville and Star Trek (from which the first show is inspired) paint the future of humanity with an optimistic brush, a future where we react in the first way mentioned above, we meet up with other spacefaring species and learn to coexist and even form federaions with them. And the intolerant xenophobic aliens are cast as the aggressive antagonists, a problem to be resolved.\r\n\r\nGiven the current state of affairs, it's a bit hard to be this optimistic about humanity's future. Imagine if first contact with an alien species happened today, with the dominant (yet spiraling) superpower presided over by an openly racist president, and a wave of far-right nationalism across the world facing migrants everywhere. How welcoming would we be towards an entirely alien species, when we can't even be welcoming to our own kind?\r\n\r\nI'm sure there's been fiction that covered this angle (District 9 comes to mind), but I'm not sure there's been any that covered the entire transition - from first contact to xenophobic hate groups to somehow leading to planetary unification and eventually to a Star Trek-like future. It would at least be an interesting story, and if we can speculate about how to bring that future about, it might even help us with our present problems too.",

And maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it has a profound kind of balance too: each principle holds the other in check: you should enjoy life, but not by hurting other people; and you should help other people, but not to your own detriment.\r\n\r\n(A third movie, Bill and Ted Face the Music has been greenlighted and might come as soon as end of 2019!)",

It's something my family celebrates.\r\n\r\nI am of course, ethnically Chinese, but I don't talk about it much. When asked, I will often reply that I identify as a Filipino, not as Chinese (maybe slightly more relevant these days given our disagreement with our largely populated neighboring country). I don't reject the heritage or anything - but I'm not particularly steeped in it either.\r\n\r\nI don't speak the language (beyond a few token phrases). When we were kids my dad had a few Chinese language learning books laying around the house, but they were mostly inscrutable, too difficult for a kid to pick up without instruction. \r\n\r\nI didn't go to Chinese school. My brother did, for a year, then my folks gave up on it because he had trouble with having to learn in three languages, especially since we didn't even speak Chinese at home.\r\n\r\nI don't even enjoy Chinese food. I mean, I'll eat some of it sometimes, but more often there's far too much vegetables for my sake. Imagine how I felt my first time travelling to Hong Kong, everytime the officemates would go out for dinner it would be Chinese food. (I write about that a bit here.)\r\n\r\nI'm not bragging or anything, just another life observation. Our family never got too into Chinese culture in the Philippines. I myself am probably more Westernized than Chinese if anything. We do observe some things like the aforementioned Chinese New Year. And some Chinese traditions during funerals and such. I was exposed to a bit more Chinese culture at my first job, where there were special activites during the Mooncake festival and so on.\r\n\r\nThat being said, I do think it's a good idea to acknowledge and celebrate one's cultural heritage even when one doesn't particularly enjoy it. So today, I guess I'm Chinese.",

From a certain POV, the bannings may be unfair, as they are \"preventive\" in nature, i.e. punishment is given preemptively before any offence is discovered.\r\n\r\nIt's interesting to me because it shows that being under the sway of an authoritarian leadership can be considered a competitive disadvantage in the international marketplace. Trust in the Russian and Chinese governments is low (internationally), which affects the corporations working out of those states. While they may not be doing anything nefarious now, the fact that these states can possibly influence these companies is already a considerable risk, especially for government's mission-critical systems given the geopolitical history and past behavior of those states.\r\n\r\nEven here in the Philippines, there is some level of mistrust against the entry of the supposed third telco, which is a consortium of which China Telecom is a part, mainly for security concerns as well.\r\n\r\nIn theory, this distrust should not be limited to Russia and China. For example, the US also has a history of requesting information from tech companies like Facebook, Google, Twitter, and so on. So in theory these US-based companies should not be trusted with communication platforms, etc. The difference is that the US-based companies have a stronger history of independence from the US government. They also regularly release reports about how the US and other governments request data from them. These are exercises to build trust from the consumer base, to emphasize their independence from any one state authority.\r\n\r\nThe Kaspersky ban was a relatively small deal, I'm not even sure if it affected Kaspersky at all. But the Huawei (and potentially ZTE as well) ban would be more important as Huawei is a very large telecoms company currently. It will be interesting to see how they move forward - will they take actions to assert their independence from the Chinese state and improve international trust? Or will they double down and have China resort to diplomatic pressure?",

Instead I'd have a couple of sandwiches and a thermos of water. So I wasn't used to handling money. One time while waiting for the school bus, I was a bit thirsty but my thermos was already out. For some reason, I decided to borrow five pesos from a classmate to buy a coke from the canteen. This gave me a bit anxiety on the ride home. It meant I had to ask my parents for money so I can pay back the guy! I had never asked for money before. I didn't mention it when I got home. The next day, the guy asks to be paid back, and I put him off til the next day. This went on for a couple of days until I got the nerve to ask my parents for money and it turned out to be no big deal.\r\n\r\nI remembered this today because I was wondering why now as an adult I'm extremely averse to debt. This incident isn't probably all there is to it, but it was the earliest and only time I can ever remember being in debt. I dislike owing other people, whether it be money or other things. I try avoid borrowing money as much as possible, and even when I end up having to (usually due to something silly like forgetting my wallet or something), I'll pay it back as soon as possible. I don't take out loans to make large purchases, I wait until I have enough money available for all of it. I use credit cards, but only for convenience. I pay off each bill in full immediately so I don't accrue debt and/or interest. If I buy something on installment, in my head and in my accounting that is money already spent in full. To this day, I am primarily a creditor, not a debtor. I am the one other people owe money to. \r\n\r\nI understand that debt can be a powerful instrument for things like investments and businesses as such, but I just dislike the idea of it. This might be one of the reasons why I can't be an entrepreneur - I would be very averse to for example taking out a loan to fund a business. In spite of that, I think it's a net positive overall. (Although certainly, I can say this because I enjoy a certain level of privilege in life.)",

Microsoft held a [counterpart celebration] where they only require you to submit 1 pull request to any Microsoft repository.\r\n\r\nI've always wanted to start participating in Open Source, but it's a bit difficult to find a good place to contribute (other than logging issues of course). So when I heard about this activity, I thought \"Why not?\" Anyway, I'm not ashamed to admit 4 out of my 5 PRs were to small/minor projects, some of them seemingly created specifically to help farm Hacktoberfest PRs lol. I did manage to get one pull request accepted for my current favorite editor, VSCode! So that's something! It was just a super minor bug fix, but it feels good to know that some future build of VS Code may have some code I wrote in it. This also qualified me to get swag from Microsoft! I haven't gotten any open source-related swag since the dearly-departed Adobe Flex shirt from 2008 (RIP Adobe Flex).\r\n\r\nI'm only posting about this now, four months after the fact, because my Hacktoberfest swag only came in last week and I had to swing by the post office to pick them up.

My choices came down to either Ori and the Blind Forest or Hollow Knight. My impression that was that Ori had the more challenging platforming, while Hollow Knight had the more challenging combat. I chose Ori at that time, and I enjoyed that game. Last October, Hollow Knight was in a Humble Monthly, and I decided to go for it. I played it for just about a month since January, and my impressions remain the same, but I now think that while Ori had a better visual presentation, Hollow Knight is the superior game.\r\n\r\nThat's not taking anything away from Hollow Knight's aesthetic mind you, it's a perfectly gorgeous game. It's just that I remember enjoying Ori's visuals more. Here's a couple of screens!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOri had a few more challenging platforming bits, but some areas in Hollow Knight provide a significant challenge as well (looking at you White Palace!). Movement in Hollow Knight also felt a lot more fun and fluid - it was great dashing and double jumping and wall jumping across the screens once I had full mobility. Hollow Knight has a stronger combat focus, and some of the fights can get very challenging indeed (as of this writing I have yet to complete the Trial of the Fool). \r\n\r\nThe progression in Hollow Knight is also less linear than Ori - which can be a bit of a double-edged sword. While the freedom to roam is nice, it can also lead to some frustrating moments when you find a path that looks like you might be able to do it with a bit tighter platforming, but it turns out you should just wait for some other ability to unlock before going for it. I feel like there's a lot more stuff to hunt down for completionists too. I finished the game at 105% completion. Post-launch DLC pushed the maximum up to 112%, but I doubt I'll be bothering to do most of the other stuff, I'm pretty satisfied with the game as-is. I did manage to hit all three main endings somehow!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike Ori, not gonna go for achievement completion on this one. Some of the challenges are a bit too much for me. It's actually surprising to me how I can still play and enjoy action games like this, given how terrible my reflexes are nowadays, but Metroidvanias have a special place in my gaming heart for some reason and somehow I am able to muddle through. With deaths. Many, many deaths. I finished Ori with 900+ deaths. Hollow Knight doesn't track this statistic (thankfully?), but I probably got close to that number in Hollow Knight too. I'll probably wait a while before picking another one up again though, maybe let my slow reflexes relax for a while with some turn-based games instead.\r\n\r\nNote: Coincidentally, the sequel for Hollow Knight was just announced! IDK if I'd play it - I haven't played yet the sequels to the last two Metroidvanias I played (Guacamelee and Ori and the Blind Forest), somehow a completely new experience seems better for me.",

But I'm not very good at doing it at night. Insomnia is a common problem for me. I often find it difficult to go to sleep at night, taking upwards of 1-2 hours in bed before I can manage to fall asleep. Of course all that time lying there feels unproductive, so I'll often be tempted to to grab a nearby screen and read something online or such, which makes it even harder to get to sleep.\r\n\r\nI don't blame the electronics devices completely, though. I remember even when I was a kid I would sometimes have trouble sleeping at night due to a hyperactive brain having too many trains of thoughts to resolve. Something I still carry to this day, though I like to imagine my ability to compartmentalize thoughts has improved since then.\r\n\r\nI remember when Warcraft III came out, one of the hero characters had an ability to send other units to sleep and I always chose that ability because I wanted to have it IRL. Not to use on other people, but on myself so I could sleep on demand.\r\n\r\nGetting a continuous block of eight hours of sleep (or even six or seven hours) is pretty rare for me as well. Usually I'll wake up after 1-2 hours, then if I'm lucky I manage to go to sleep again. If not, sometimes I'll give up and work on stuff until it's breakfast time. \r\n\r\nSometimes I try to force-reset my sleep cycle by going like 36 hours without sleep so I can't help but be real tired and sleep continuously for a while. But it usually doesn't last. And I'm at that age where going 36 hours without sleep isn't really that easy.\r\n\r\nIt doesn't help that since I quit working full-time I usually have a highly irregular daily schedule. Combined with a tendency to take naps during the day, it leads to the irregular sleep cycle. I also like having breakfast early so I often wake up at like 5 to 6 in the AM, no matter how late I went to sleep, then just recover sleep with naps during the day, making it harder to go to sleep early in the night, and so on. A bit of a vicious cycle. Also, it makes me a weird kind of cross between a morning person and a night owl.\r\n\r\nOne of the problems with sleep is that even though it feels great, when you sleep so much it feels unproductive, like you could've put that time to better use. I remember maybe a decade or so ago, I was reading about the idea of polyphasic sleep. I liked the idea because it meant fewer sleep hours overall during the day, which meant more time for doing stuff. Sadly, I never got it to work. It's a bit challenging to do it with a nine-to-five job, but even without that, I don't really have the discipline to keep it up. And also, I like sleeping a lot sometimes.\r\n\r\nI'll end this post with this tweet:\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 943137889977819138 }}\r\n\r\n...then I'll go take a nap.",

For someone like me who spends a lot of time on the internet, there's a lot of feeds I follow. Not just social media like Facebook and Twitter, I also follow a set of RSS Feeds via Inoreader, I've signed up for a few newsletters, and on weekends I read through several Flipboard categories. Just another symptom of my tendency to want everything I guess. \r\n\r\nIt is arguably all too much. So I thought about Marie Kondo-ing some of that stuff. The main problem right now is my RSS feeds - I follow some feeds that simply have too much content, and this means I accumulate a significantly high unread count in the app, which gives me some anxiety. While those feeds have the occasional interesting post or article I want to read, the sheer number of posts means the signal-to-noise ratio is very low for those channels. So I'm going to cut the most prolific offenders and see if the content I would've gotten from there would surface some other way. \r\n\r\nI do still like those channels, so I'll also promote them a bit:\r\n\r\nHacker News - there is a lot of high quality content here, and many of them won't surface through other channels. But there are a lot of posts, so the volume is still difficult to keep up with. I've instead moved them to a Flipboard section, and just check out that section from time to time.\r\nDev.to - less tech industry and more programming-related posts, many of them beginner-oriented so not really for me. There is the occasional gem, but the S/N ratio is worse than HN by far. It would be great to read all that content if your goal was to know everything in all areas of software development, but anyone who's spent any nontrivial amount of time in the industry knows that's a fool's errand. I also follow them on Twitter, so maybe that's enough instead of the RSS feed. They also have a weekly \"most popular posts\" post, I might look into whether I can somehow subscribe to only those posts and see if that's sufficient\r\nSlashdot - one of the oldest tech news blogs around, and I've been following them on and off for years. The content I get from their feed has a lot of overlap with Hacker News and the tech section on Flipboard, but occasionally they have an interesting post that none of my other sources provide. The volume of posts isn't as high as the previous two, but the S/N ratio is worse. I'll try living without them for a while.\r\n\r\nNote that a feed having a low S/N ratio is in no way a condemnation of their content. It's just that not all content is good for everybody, and hence some feeds are better for some people than others.\r\n\r\nAll of this applies to social media too of course. I try to unfollow ruthlessly. On Facebook, which I mostly restrict to friends and family, I unfollow anyone who posts content I dislike (conspiracy theories, chain messages, \"let's see who will read this\", inspirational messages, etc) and generally favor anyone who posts puns lol (I find the overlap between those two sets is low). Anyway, they're still \"friends\" on Facebook, so they can still message me and stuff. On Twitter, every so often I'll unfollow a bunch and follow some other set, change it up a bit. You need to adjust your feeds when it feels like you're seeing too much of one type of content or too much you dislike.\r\n\r\nIt would be great to have some sort of machine learning that I can teach as to which kinds of posts I prefer and which ones I want to ignore. Supposedly, social media's \"algorithmic timelines\" are supposed to improve the S/N ratio of your feeds, but my problem with those is that items aren't being displayed chronologically, which makes a feed work. Maybe I should write my own feed reader! (Not the first time I've had this thought!)",

But sometimes I think about doing some stuff that involves some level of public performance. My examples for this post are:\r\n\r\ngame streaming\r\npublic speaking\r\nstandup comedy\r\n\r\nPublic speaking and standup comedy are basically the same, and might be interesting to do (standup seems more fun). Like many people, I used to have a mild fear of speaking in front of a bunch of people/strangers, but as I've gotten older and cared less about what other people think, this kind of faded away. But the main issue with these two items is that they require a lot of prep, and that's something I'm generally bad at (chalk it up to lack of discipline etc). I generally tend to prefer to \"wing it\", even back in the college days, not that I'm particularly good at it. \r\n\r\nGame streaming seems like it could be good. Not much prep needed aside from some general familiarity with the game I'm playing. In fact, I've already set up a twitch channel before and did a few test broadcasts. My main problem with game streaming is that there's a need to be talking all the time - avoiding dead air. And it can feel weird doing that with nobody around. I guess it's more of a beginning streamer problem? If there were people in the twitch chat it would probably be easier. Or if there was someone else in the room with me while I'm streaming.\r\n\r\nA friend also sometimes suggests I make a webcomic, that also seems like a viable option. My problem with that one is the prep again. You need to be able to come up with material on a regular basis, and I'm not sure I can do that. As I say to my friend, I'm a generally witty guy, but my wit is more of \"in the moment\" insted of something I can summon on command. But then again, maybe the fact that I'm now able to make daily blog posts means a regular (weekly?) webcomic would now be viable?\r\n\r\nAn issue I have with trying to pick up new hobbies is the climb you have as a beginner, where everything you try sucks at first. I really dislike that initial learning period. But as Jake the Dog says \"Dude, sucking at something is the first step towards being sort of good at something.\"",

Too many people I knew getting butthurt or reacting poorly. Someone I knew since high school unfriended me over some imagined slight even. Probably face to face discussions are better for people you know personally. Somehow debating online is easier with strangers. Maybe it's because you can dismiss them out of your life easily?\r\n\r\nIn any case, picking your battles is a necessary skill I need to improve on. I'm much more selective nowadays about when I choose to engage. I still enjoy the occasional good debate, but those can be difficult to find. \r\n\r\nI even hold back myself from playing devil's advocate these days, especially when a friend is ranting about something or other. There's a good time to play devil's advocate, but when someone's ranting, they probably just want to rant.\r\n\r\nThe world needs more rational discourse.",

I've even seen a few meme images about it:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Image credit: Reddit)\r\n\r\nI imagine that this tendency is because we are so starved of things to be proud of as a nation that we latch on to anything that is even remotely Filipino. Or maybe it stems from an inferiority complex, so we as a nation always want to be reminded that yes, we can accomplish great things too, we're not any worse than any other nation/ethnicity.\r\n\r\nI don't really get this kind of Pinoy pride. I mean, I feel no special pride upon learning that some famous person happens to share some portion of my ethnicity, or that by geographical coincidence we were born in the same country. At best learning of such a thing would maybe elicit a \"Neat!\" from me. I don't really get the wild celebration over something like Pacquiao winning another bout or the country winning Ms Universe, etc. I suppose I'd have a better reaction if it was related to one of my interests, like a Pinoy winning a Magic World Championship, but that's less of pride and more of it inspires me that maybe I can do that too. \r\n\r\nThis is not to say I don't have a sense of national pride at all. There are some national accomplishments that do make me proud - an example would be ousting the dictator Marcos in 1986. Or maybe if we had some great advancement in science or culture.

Really, if you can demonstrate that you really worked on a project (and not just coasted by on teammates help etc), you're already an above average interview.\r\n\r\nEntry-level candidates might have more trouble since they often won't have a portfolio, but the quality of candidates is a bit low locally, so if you can demonstrably do simple stuff like loops, recursion, stacks, etc you're probably already an above average interview. Bigger companies will have written exams to filter out peeps who can't do that though.\r\n\r\nMore random technical interviewing tips, even though you didn't ask for that: being able to communicate well is a big plus, mandatory even. Lack of confidence makes the interviewer worry that you don't really know what you're talking about. Sometimes I'll slip in something I know to be wrong \"Diba pag cinall mo yan, ganito mangyayari?\", and see how the candidate reacts\r\n\r\n veeequalseyeare: How many years of experience do you have? And what's your basic salary?\r\n\r\nWhy do people keep asking about salary? That's not really a programming or software dev question. I am a freelancing consultant at the moment, so I can't really give a simple answer to that anyway (it's almost always \"it depends\")\r\n\r\nI will answer the experience one - 15ish years in the industry (yeah, I'm old).\r\n\r\nEdit: Also, there is a high range in the salaries of software devs in this country (not sure if the same elsewhere, probably), because:\r\n\r\nsome people are better at selling themselves than others\r\nsome devs are way better than others (and thus are more valuable)\r\neach dev's career path and growth is often unique, so it's difficult to compare, especially once you rack up some years of experience\r\n\r\ni.e. for a given number of years of experience, the salary band will be quite wide. \r\n\r\nI get that when you're starting out, salary is a big deal, but honestly if you're a decent enough programmer, you can get into any place with above average salary. You can grow your salary a bit faster by hopping jobs every so often, but too many hops looks bad on a resume. \r\n\r\nAnyway, my advice is that once you get to a decent salary range that is good for you (i.e. you're not starving), focus less on comparing yourself to other people, and more on increasing your own value and managing your work/life balance. Money isn't everything, beyond basic survival.\r\n\r\n getmeoutofherealive: Anong advice ang maibibigay mo kapag gusto magcareer shift? Ex: IT Support to Development/Programming.\r\n\r\nShifting careers from IT support isn't an unreasonable proposition, but you need to already know your stuff before going in for interviews. You will also still need some basic level of programming knowledge. A lot of things you'll need can be learned on the fly/on the job (like usage of specific languages or tools or libraries), but you need a good basic foundation to build on.\r\n\r\nIf I'm interviewing someone coming from a nonprogrammming background, I'll basically be treating her as an entry-level candidate. You will need to be able to justify why I should hire you over say, a fresh grad who still remembers his java programming from his college days. The interviewer will need to know you're not trying to BS your way into the position. Having some work you can show off (side projects or whatever) can be a big help. You can also cite anything you're doing in your current domain that might show off some related skillset. Like, if you did some minor scripting to gather support statistics, something like that? IDK if IT support people do that kind of stuff. See my other interview tips in the other answer elsewhere in this thread too.\r\n\r\n captainph: web services in web development, ELI5 please\r\n\r\nWait, what do you mean? Web services are like web pages, except they're endpoints that usually do only one thing and return some machine readable format like JSON or XML instead of HTML that can be rendered and viewed by a human in a browser. Basically you send them an HTTP request and they maybe do some processing and spit back an HTTP response that you consume.\r\n\r\nSome types are simpler than others - REST-based web services are usually very simple for example, and can sometimes be invoked directly via the browser address bar. Some follow more complicated protocols (SOAP) that support things like authentication and signing and so on.\r\n\r\nWeb services are developed the same way as normal web pages, with the usual backend processing and stuff (but there are some frameworks to make this easier, especially for complicated protocols like SOAP), but the client program (the one calling the web services) does not have to be another web application. It can be a mobile app for example.\r\n\r\nOne of the typical usages would be third-party integration. For example, Philhealth I believe currently has some kind of e-Claims web services in development (maybe? IDK the current status), where the idea is to allow third-party systems to submit Philhealth claims electronically. The idea is that individual hospitals have their own medical records systems, those systems can send HTTP requests to the e-claims web services in order to for example check whether a patient is eligible for a claim.\r\n\r\nOk, sorry I know that explanation doesn't really work for a 5-year old lol\r\n\r\n acequeen21: Do you have plans going abroad? Either work temporarily or move permanently. Why or why not?\r\n\r\nNah, I like living here, in spite of everything, and I'm programming avails me a good living naman. I've worked abroad on short stints (pinadala ng company), but TBH, I had never even considered leaving the country long-term, but I started looking into it after 2016. Hassle for me na ma-uproot and to try to start over elsewhere.",

I had heard some good things, but I didn't really know much other than it was a roguelite where I had to go through a dungeon. But it was cheap so I took the dive.\r\n\r\nI was pleasantly surprised to find that not only was it a roguelite, it was also a deckbuilding game! I love deckbuilding games, they often generate a significant amount of variance that translates to fun, and pairing that mechanic with a roguelite meant each run would be pretty interesting.\r\n\r\nSo in Slay the Spire, you choose a character from three choices, each of which have a different set of powers and cards. You go through the dungeons, one room at a time. Each room might have an enemy, a treasure or a random event. The map for the entire dungeon act is available ahead of time, so you can plot your route as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYour character is equipped with a deck of cards that includes attacks and blocks and powers. Along the way you can add new cards to your deck by defeating enemies or opening chests or buying from merchants and so on. \r\n\r\nThere are three available characters to play (as of now), and they offer pretty different play styles. There's the Ironclad, who's kind of a straightforward attack and block kind of guy. There's the Silent, a rogue who prefers chaining multiple attacks or using poison. And there's the Defect, who summons persistent orbs that perform various functions. The dungeon proceeds the same way for each class, but they have different card sets to choose from so battles often play out differently, and each character has different builds you can lean towards to increase your odds of a successful run.\r\n\r\nBattles proceed in a turn-based manner. You draw some number of cards from your deck and each turn, and play as many as your energy allows. The unique thing about Slay the Spire is that during your turn, you can see each enemy's intent. That is, you can see what the enemy will do next turn, more or less, via an icon over their head (see image).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the enemy plans to attack, there's an icon over their head indicating how much damage and how many attacks they're going to do. If they're going to block, there's a shield icon. And there's icon for if they are going to do buffs or debuffs. In a sense the game gives you perfect information about what the enemies are going to do. \r\n\r\nThis means every turn is sort of a mini-puzzle: what are the cards I need to play to minimize the amount of damage I take (always your priority, since taking too much damage endangers your run) or should I try to avoid debuffs or can I maybe already beat the enemy this turn?\r\n\r\nIt all plays out in the framework of the spire, the dungeon you're trying to conquer, with the map being randomly generated rooms. Every room presents choices: which card to add to your deck? Which card to remove? Should I risk some HP to gain a relic? And so on.\r\n\r\nIt's all very fun, and quite challenging. It can also be frustrating, but since the game gives you near perfect information (you even know at the start of a floor which among a set of bosses you are going to be facing at the end of the floor), any deaths are always at least partly your fault.\r\n\r\nI tend to wait until I've \"completed\" games before I review them, and for Slay the Spire I did manage to finish a run with each class at least once. But I've only scratched the surface, there's a ton of content beyond that. I haven't even gotten the \"true ending\" yet, which only becomes available after beating the game once with each class, as the \"true ending\" boss is quite difficult. And even beyond that there's special cards to unlock, daily challenges with different parameters, and even an endless mode I haven't tried yet. I also hear that the devs are very diligent and add content on a regular basis.\r\n\r\nSlay the Spire recently went \"live\" and left Early Access, just last month, and they're planning for a Switch port too. The one disadvantage of the game for me is that each run takes a considerable amount of time (You can actually quit at any time during a run and resume it later, but I always feel compelled to finish each run in one sitting), and I have a lot of other games to play. I'll still probably revisit the Spire from time to time, but frankly trying to \"complete\" the game, Steam achievements and all, seems like a huge task, given the large amount of variance in the game, but maybe I'll get there someday.",

It always takes me some time to adjust to any new trappings, and I almost always expect on my first few nights at a new place that I won't get the correct amount of sleep or be awake at the proper times.\r\n\r\nI wonder if there is some primordial instinct that causes us to be wary of unfamiliar sleeping arrangements, granting (against our will) heightened awareness in case of predators.\r\n\r\nLeaves me more time to ponder life's mysteries at least.",

My first exposure to subtitles was anime of course, but these days I vastly prefer having subtitles on any show, even if it's dubbed in a language I do understand. From the article:\r\n\r\n “Why do you have captions on?\" I asked.\r\n \r\n “It helps me with my ADHD: I can focus on the words, I catch things I missed, and I never have to go back,\" she replied. “And I can text while I watch.\"\r\n\r\nI don't think I have ADHD, that's not something diagnosed very often over here, though I'm sure I exhibit a certain lack of focus. But I can relate to how subtitles help me avoid having to rewind a show for something I missed. The subtitles act like a kind of fallback to the verbal/audio cues, helping me when I get distracted (quite easily) and when I'm multitasking. They also help with accents and murmured words and things like that. \r\n\r\nThere are people who don't like subtitles when they aren't necessary, complaining that having to read distracts them from the film. I imagine those people are the same kind of people who don't like reading books or reading in general.",

I like ones that have a level of ambiguity, a meaning that changes depending on situation. \"This too shall pass\" teaches us to hope in times of desperation, and encourages temperance in times of plenty. Hope is a good thing, especially in times like these when many problems plague the world.\r\n\r\nIt also reminds me of Shelley's sonnet Ozymandias, which reminds us that even the greatest of empires fade away:\r\n\r\n \"And on the pedestal these words appear:\r\n 'My name is Ozymandias, king of kings;\r\n Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!'\r\n Nothing beside remains.

That bot is still up and running on Twitter, you can check it out there!\r\n\r\nBut today, I thought I'd write about the answer-checking mechanism used by the bot. It was a bit interesting to me because it was the first nontrivial use I had for Django's unit testing framework. I'm not too keen on unit testing web functionality (something I still have to learn), but this seemed an appropriate first use of a unit test framework for several reasons:\r\n\r\nthe bot had to be able to handle a wide variety of answers\r\nthere were a lot of test cases to check and a single checking function handling everything - I couldn't risk breaking previous working tests\r\ninputs were discrete and outputs were easily checkable\r\nI needed to be able to add new test scenarios all the time as more problematic answers were provided\r\n\r\nThe project currently isn't open source, but I did make a gist of the tests.py I used here.\r\n\r\nThe check function basically accepts three parameters: \r\n\r\na checking mode (currently only supports EXACT and ALL_ANYORDER)\r\nthe answer phrase provided by the player\r\na set of valid answers accepted for the question\r\n\r\nThere's a number of test cases already handled:\r\n\r\nchecking should be case-insensitive\r\narticles should be ignored if they're at the start of the answer phrase\r\nnumbers should be acceptable for the spelled-out versions i.e. \"7\" should be accepted for \"seven\", and vice versa\r\nsome minor soundex (phonetic matching) support (via Python Jellyfish)\r\nhandling of questions that support multiple answers. This is what ALL_ANYORDER is for - it means that all the given answers must be provided, but they can be in any order. i.e. if the valid answer set is \"Huey\", \"Dewey\" and \"Louie\", then \"Louie Huey Dewey\" should be accepted as an answer\r\nnonalphanumeric characters should be treated as whitespace, except in some special cases\r\nspecial case: abbreviations like \"don't\" or \"can't\" should be treated as if they were a single term like \"dont\" or \"cant\" instead of \"don t\" or \"can t\"\r\n\r\nThe answer checking definitely still isn't perfect, but I'm pretty happy with where it's at right now. There is also definitely an element of subjectivity as to which answers should be accepted. One time a player complained that his answer \"Batman vs Superman Dawn of Justice\" should count for \"Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice\", but for this particular question I had chosen not to allow \"vs\" for \"v\" because that was the actual movie title, which might be unreasonable now that I think about it!\r\n\r\nI do know that I need to implement a better \"synonym\" handling, i.e. mapping of \"v\"-\"vs\" and other terms like \"mr\"-\"mister\" or \"natl\"-\"national\". The problem with handling things like that is that is the possible combinations of phrases expands when multiple such terms are found in the same answer, so it can't scale too well. I suppose I need to normalize the answer sets at the time the question is defined. What do you know, I figured out how to do something just by writing a blog post!\r\n\r\nI do have a bunch of other enhancements planned for the trivia bot, including support for slack and discord, and a longer time frame roadmap, but I'm not sure when I can commit more time to it. Still, it's turned out to be a pretty fun endeavor, I'm hoping it leads to something cool!",

Some examples of what I mean:\r\n\r\nMy mom pays for thousands of pesos worth of groceries and doesn't bother going through the receipt to make sure the cashier punched in the right items\r\nWe order food in restaurants that is cooked and prepared outside of our view and trust that they are prepared appropriately and with proper regard for health standards\r\nI take naps in a taxi cab assuming the driver won't take me to a secluded location and try to rob me\r\nWe cross the street trusting that drivers are sensible people who won't blow past traffic lights and suddenly careen towards us\r\nWe go to work and trust that our coworkers will do their thing and our work will get done and the company is going to pay us\r\nWe order stuff online and assume that the order will be fulfilled\r\n\r\nAll of this, in spite of the fact that we know there are humans who exist who are incompetent, unreliable, or even downright malicious or sociopathic. It's a weird thing to be amazed at because of course, we assume a certain level of trust in our fellow man, otherwise society wouldn't be able to function at all. But held in contrast with the day-to-day news of stupidity and evil and deception that is prevalent in the world, one wonders where this well of trust and optimism comes from. Somehow in spite of everything, humanity still holds faith in itself.",

I always had the general sense of it before, but not that it was specifically for use against oppressive or authoritarian governments. It is believed the phrase has origins in a Quaker pamphlet published in 1955.\r\n\r\nI was reminded of this phrase today and looked it up because it seems relevant again recently, at least in the Philippines. Recently Maria Ressa, the head of the online news site Rappler, was arrested at dusk (so no bail could be set), on charges of cyberlibel, for an online article published before cyberlibel became a crime. Ostensibly, the state's rationale is that there was a minor edit to the article after the cyberlibel law was passed.\r\n\r\nI'm struggling to think of any instance where a state authority arrested journalists without the intent to silence criticism. I'm not saying there aren't any - there probably are - but probably such instances don't get much publicity precisely because they are normal functions of the state. For this instance, it feels very much as just the next step in targetted harassment against those who, as they say, speak truth to power. I remember one of the pork barrel senators saying during the launch of his senatorial campaign that he was the victim of \"selective justice\" (which is weird because it still implies he was guilty, just that other people were guilty too). I'm hoping in some interview someone has the balls to ask the senatorial candidates whether they think Trillianes or Ressa have been victims of \"selective justice\".\r\n\r\nPro-admin partisans of course will just say \"rule of law\" etc, which they like to do when someone they dislike is being targetted, but not when say, suspected criminals are killed by vigilantes or under suspicious circumstances by the police. Most probably in their heart of hearts they know exactly what is going on here, and they either approve of it wholeheartedly or view it as a necessary compromise in their pursuit of what they believe to be good for the country.\r\n\r\nI've tried to avoid being too political in this blog, maybe sticking with the occasional rant or election-related personal leanings post. But with the climate these days, I'm not sure that's resposible. Those of us who are able to speak out on our platforms, no matter how small, don't we have a responsibility to speak truth to power?",

The movie looked fantastic and the fight scenes were great. Plot was supercondensed, several books' worth of story combined into one. Ended in a weird place, kinda? Easily the best western live action anime adaptation by far.\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 1093511652643762176 }}\r\n\r\nIn another volume of \"catching up with older films to improve my geek cred\", I watched The Usual Suspects on Netflix. The movie was still really good, despite the internet having spoiled the Keyser Soze twist for me (and countless others) many years ago. I can see why Spacey won an Oscar for his performance here.\r\n\r\nI saw Ralph Breaks The Internet with the nieces last weekend. The younger one really enjoyed the scenes with the Disney princesses. Movie was pretty good, despite losing the novelty of the first film. Many tropes were visited.\r\n\r\nOver on the Netflix side, I've been enjoying The Patriot Act with Hasan Minaj. Highly informative about a wide range of topics, I thought it would be solely about politics, but there were some surprising discussions on things like, uh, shoes? Conservatives may be annoyed by the liberal bias, but otherwise the show does a good job of breaking down complicated topics.\r\n\r\nThey also had a few seasons of Family Guy up recently, and it's a pretty good series to have running in the background while I'm working on other stuff so I managed to watch all of it fairly easily. I'm not sure it's good for my mental health though.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of Seth MacFarlane shows, I've caught up with The Orville recently, and this show has been great. It's basically Star Trek for a newer generation, but with a different (and sometimes more interesting) mythos and history and so on. The show is much more willing to tackle complex ideas relevant to the modern world as well. I hope it does well and goes on for many seasons to come.",

It's a pretty neat service that allows you to write privately online. It's not public like blogging is, so if you'd like to develop a daily writing habit but don't want things to be available to the world, it's a pretty good option. You can of course, just write on paper or on local files and just not upload anything to the cloud at all. But there's some benefits to an online service like this one too - the most obvious one is that you can write anywhere, with any internet connected device, but they also have a few other nifty features like tracking streaks (which can be great for building habits), and 750words even allows you to attach daily metadata to your posts (such as a number indicating your mood for the day or how many hours you slept) and it can later show you a chart of how that metadata changes over time. They also have stats like how fast you type, or what mood your writing indicates and so on.\r\n\r\nI was reminded of this service because I found the export files I got from them a while back. More than a year's worth of daily posts, 365 entries apparently according to the site. I've been thinking about writing a python script to parse the export files and mass-import the posts into this blog (back filling 2011-2012 when I wasn't blogging much), but there's a few issues with that:\r\n\r\ngenerally, the style of entries is more \"what I was doing this day\" than the kind of stuff I write now, which can be fine, as it still provides a good window into what was happening with me in the past\r\nsome entries may contain information I wouldn't normally write in a public post. I may name names, talk about people I'm annoyed with, and so on\r\nit was not uncommon back then for me to have a mental block and not knowing what to type that often led me to just typing words at random until I either hit the target goal or subconsciously hit upon a topic I'd like to talk about\r\n\r\nI guess the privacy is the real issue. The best option is probably to export them as Hugo drafts, then review each draft one by one before having them go live on the site.

I haven't done this in a while, taking my daily walk in the early morning. I used to do it pretty regularly, except back then I confined myself to the inner roads of our subdivision, or doing loops around the covered court in the nearby seminary. Walking the same routes every morning and doing repetitive routes got boring after a while, and combined with my erratic sleep schedule the habit soon fell off the wayside. I resumed my walking habit when I took a break from work in 2016, but this time mostly doing it late in the afternoons.\r\n\r\nAfternoons have been getting more difficult lately, with some busyness in the schedule and the sudden yet inevitable onset of the summer heat, so I decided to try shifting back to mornings again. We'll see how long it lasts.\r\n\r\nWalking during the early mornings, before the sun has even broken, has a completely different atmosphere than the afternoons or even the evenings. The streets glow a pale blue and are nearly empty, though traffic is already starting to build up at some of the busier intersections. There are few other people out on their feet (as opposed to in cars) this early, enough that I would involuntarily nod when I passed some other early morning walker. I'm surprised to find that a nearby Jollibee operated 24 hours, and that the nearby Starbucks didn't. I assumed it was the other way around.\r\n\r\nI pass by a student on her way to school, with a companion accompanying her as she flags down a jeep. I commiserate with how early students need to get up to go to school in this country. I remember my own childhood when my mom would pick me up and drag me over to the sink to splash my face with water to get me going at five in the morning. Class usually started at seven, but the school bus would pick us up around six or even earlier. Somehow, we may be teaching kids to hate mornings.\r\n\r\nI'm not one of those \"not a morning person\" people. I don't need coffee to get started in the mornings either. I enjoy sleeping in when I can, but I'm always willing and able to get up early if I needed to. Combined with my tendency to sleep late into the night, this has led to my terribly erratic sleep schedule. Even as I'm walking out on the streets before the break of dawn, I expect myself to be taking a second sleep after getting home and having breakfast.\r\n\r\nThe sun starts to break through the night as I near the end of my route, a couple of corners away from home. My walk this morning is a bit shorter than my usual target of steps. There are some areas I prefer not to traverse before the light of day, so my options are a bit limited. As I get used to walking in the early mornings again I'll try a few different routes to see if I can increase my steps. In the meantime, I turn the corner and head back home, looking forward to the morning's pan de sal.",

Now, I like to be optimistic about people and give them the benefit of the doubt, so in a bid to understand I tried to list down some possible motivations for Person A to do so.\r\n\r\nThere are I believe two axes to consider:\r\nwhether Person A believes Party B is good/bad for the country\r\nwhether Person A personally has good/bad motives\r\n\r\nQuadrant 1: Person A believes Party B is good for the country, and Person A has good motives\r\nPerson A does not believe the negative things about Party B\r\n\r\nQuadrant 2: Person A believes Party B is bad for the country, and Person A has good motives\r\n\"Lesser evil\": Person A believes that while Party B is bad for the country, other options are worse\r\n\"Necessary evil\": Person A believes the support of Party B (as a party in power) is necessary to get good things done and is using them as a means to an end to achieve better things.\r\n\"Cynicism\": Person A believes that Party B's politics is inevitably how the country works and to try to change things for the better would be foolish or a waste of time\r\n\r\nQuadrant 3: Person A believes Party B is good for the country, and Person A has bad motives\r\nPerson A does not believe the negative things about Party B (or does not care), and merely wants to use them to further their ambitions\r\n\r\nQuadrant 4: Person A believes Party B is bad for the country, and Person A has bad motives\r\nGreed/Ambition: Person A believes that Party B's politics is inevitably how the country works and is just looking out for theirselves\r\n\r\nDue to my own leanings, I do not believe quadrants 1 and 3 are likely (I have yet to see evidence indicating otherwise), so this does not paint a good picture of Person A.

I can only hope that at worst Person A is somewhere in quadrant 2 and not quadrant 4",

The first company I worked at, I stayed with them for thirteen years, which I now feel was way too long. I have to admit, the work was hard and challenging, but I was young and had a lot of energy and was willing to work the long hours. I was good at the work and the enjoyed the company of the people I worked with so in a certain sense I got comfortable with the status quo and stayed a bit too long. But given a do-over, I would probably prefer to have left after maybe 4-5 years.\r\n\r\nHopping jobs too quickly can be fantastic for your salary growth, but it has some disadvantages - you don't build close enough relationships, and too many hops doesn't look good on your resume. Four to five years seems like a good period to stay, long enough to learn as much as you can and build your network before moving on. \r\n\r\nThe main advantage of not staying too long comes in the form of personal growth. When you stay at a place too long you tend to stagnate. Sure, it's software development so somehow you're always improving, but not improving as quickly as you would be if you were to be thrust into a new environment every few years. Your personal network of like-minded professionals will grow quicker as well when you switch companies. I was thinking about this because I was recently asked if I could refer any senior developers and I realized my personal network of high-level senior technical guys wasn't that deep because of me staying in the same place for so long. \r\n\r\nI don't consider this a regret, I'm still pretty happy and satisfied with where I am in life. Thinking about this is more of an alternate universe \"what if\" scenario. I have to admit that staying that long did have some advantages - I got to work with and meet some good people, younger ones even, who became good friends. But this is not an argument in favor of staying that long, as you would still have the chance to build relationships even if you move on. It's possible in that alternate universe I may have made even better friends or may have even been friends with the same ones I have now somehow.\r\n\r\nSo, given a chance to give advice to my younger self, I would probably recommend the second path. There is more uncertainty there to be sure, but life is risk, and to live is to explore. Taking the change to move to a new environment optimizes for personal growth, and it's probably better to be doing it when you are young and full of energy.",

Take one or two and write them out in detail. Next time you’re in front of a warm crowd, work on telling the story. \r\n\r\nThe idea being of course, that such an exercise trains you to be more vulnerable in front on an audience. I thought about this advice for a bit and found it difficult to remember any particular moments in my life that I feel particularly embarassed or ashamed about. All people have such moments of course, so there are two possibilities: (a) my embarassing moments are so terrible brain has blocked out such memories for my own sanity; or (b) I don't remember them because I don't care too much and I move on quickly from them.\r\n\r\nI do remember being an insecure and self-conscious teenager growing up, so maybe I should have more embarassing memories from that era? But looking back now on any moments back then that I might have considered embarassing, they don't seem so bad, at least not compared to other people's embarassing stories. For all such moments that I can recall, I generally don't feel a tinge of regret - I think they were things that contributed to my growth as a person and that I should have done anyway.\r\n\r\nAs an example, the first possibly \"embarassing\" moment I could think was the first office Christmas party I went to as a working person. Now, if you're from the Philippines, you know they have this thing where they expect new hires to give a \"performance\" during the office Christmas party, as portrayed in this comic:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImage credit: Opismeyts\r\n\r\nNow back then I was fresh out of college and not a very social animal. And they wanted us to do this ridiculous looking dance that was popularized by local noontime shows of the era. Performing in public was not something I wanted to do, and I had a lot of anxiety leading up to it, as I recall I even considered skipping the event completely. But of course I went through it anyway, and though I cringed at myself the whole time, I think I did learn to laugh at myself a little bit. I credit this event for helping me \"lighten up\" as it were, be more willing to plow straight through my anxieties, and be more open to doing ridiculous things in public. (I would still be averse to say, volunteering for such a thing, but there should now be a decent possibility of convincing me...)\r\n\r\nThese days, it's rare that I feel embarassed about anything. Sometimes there'll be awkwardness somewhere when I don't know what to do, but I think that wit can push me through it. I also used to be pretty self-conscious about something like singing in public, like at a videoke session or whatever. This might be understandable given that I'm just terrible at singing - the odds that I can carry a given tune are a bit low. I used to always refuse when offered the videoke mic. But these days I'm more willing - there was a realization at some point that if I sang in public, I wasn't the one to suffer, it would be the people listening LOL.\r\n\r\nThere is popular advice that goes \"Don't sweat the small stuff\", and in the grand scheme of things those small embarassing moments you have are pretty much always small stuff, even though in the moment they may feel like almost everything is falling apart. Be willing to laugh at your own embarassments, and move on. Life is too short to be embarassed.",

For every person, there likely exists a \"tribe\", not necessarily all in one place, a community where that person would fit in. And in the modern age, the internet and social media make it all the more easier for such \"outsiders\" to connect with each other. \r\n\r\nThere is a power to this connection, to finding your tribe. It gives you strength and reinforces your beliefs and reassures you that you aren't some strange outlier undeserving of connection. This is why nerd culture has become so popular lately. Traditionally seen as outcasts in the 90s and earlier, now more than ever it has become acceptable to have geeky interests like comic books, Star Wars, tech stuff, and so on. As the early adopters of the online community, nerd culture found its footing earlier than other subcultures, and they found that yes, there are a lot of us, and now the big businesses are starting to listen, seeing the \"nerds\" as a massive market to be served.\r\n\r\nThis connectivity has some downsides too though, since it does not discriminate. This means that even followers of fringe views such as white supremacists, flat earthers, antivaxxers, conspiracy theorists, and so on can connect to each other. If you can find your tribe, they can too. The more fringe the view, the more the worldwide connectivity can empower them. Whereas before a small community might have at most 1 antivaxxer, he would have no source of materials to support his fringe view thus finding it difficult to spread his views. But multiply that with tens of thousands of such communities connected globally online, and you have potentially tens of thousands of antivaxxers. With the internet allowing antivaxxers to reach out to each other and form Facebook groups and discussion forums and such, they can spread the word more easily reinforce their own suspicions about mainstream channels and try to convince other people to join their cause. This can apply to any fringe group.\r\n\r\nJust take a look at the recent Christchurch massacre in New Zealand. The gunman livestreamed and uploaded a video manifesto online and the social media channels had a lot of trouble trying to block the spread of the video. Tens of thousands were re-sharing it, some even modifying the video to evade filters. Supportes in such violence might be rare in your local community, but online they are able to gather in the thousands.\r\n\r\nIt feels like a fundamental weakness in freedom of speech. The traditional argument in favor of allowing all speech is that the best ideas rise to the top and the terrible ones are drowned out, that such fringe views would fall to the wayside in the light of superior arguments. But that doesn't take into account people being stupid and succumbing to their confirmation biases and ignoring anything that doesn't support their world views. And as we can see with terrorism, fringe views don't require widespread support in order to damage real lives. This feels like one of those instances, where we have to sacrifice a little bit of freedom for a little bit of security (and probably lose both).\r\n\r\nI don't like it. Hopefully it's something humanity will be able to figure out sometime soon.",

This happens both with me as a customer and with me on the side of the company trying to do the sales/marketing.\r\n\r\nAn example in the software engineering sphere would be a developer writing project proposals in response to tenders, and he is asked to write a technical response confirming that their product supports a particular tender requirement. Except he knows for a fact that he doesn't, and when he raises this concern, he's told not to worry about and that they'll just implement the feature if/when they win the contract. And apparently that's a regular practice in some companies. Disclaimer: I'm not saying I have been personally involved in such a situation, but I do know such situations exist. \r\n\r\nI understand the motivation from the sales side, but not only is that intellectually dishonest (to say the least), it also puts your engineering teams in a bind should the project push through - you now committed them to do an extra feature without proper estimation or scheduling and so on.\r\n\r\nFor me it's okay to sell something by promoting its strengths and advantages, but not by being dishonest about its capabilities or weaknesses.

It's put a lie to the idea that the students of these universities represent the \"cream of the crop\" or \"the best of the best\", showing that kids can get in not only due to their own talent, but also due to money. Of course, it was always open knowledge before that one could get their kid admitted to such universities simply by making a huge donation. The recent events apparently crosses some line because the \"donation\" was in the form of bribe money to individuals instead of the school itself, but even without them there was no true meritocracy.\r\n\r\nI went to a specialized high school (and college) that had supposedly merit-based entrance exams as well, such that one could simply not get in without passing the exams. (Athletics-based admissions aren't very popular in this country.) Even in such a system, rich kids still have a significant leg up of course - aside from growing up in an environment that favored them, their parents could also afford to send them to expensive review centers to prep for the exams. I was reminded of this due to a recent thread among my HS batchmates discussing how their kids had to prep for the entrance exams years early because it was much more competitive these days.\r\n\r\nI used to be a strong believer in meritocracy when I was young (probably due to my educational background), believing it to be an ideal for society to aspire to. The idea is certainly attractive - that we should give the jobs and positions to those who would be able to use them most effectively, for the betterment of society. I later learned that the term orignated in 1958 as a condemnatory word by Michael Young in his work \"The Rise of the Meritocracy\". I realize now that while a pure meritocracy would be nice, it would disadvantage people who are already behind in life due to poverty, sickness or other such challenges. I think that like many things, some sort of balance is better struck, with a \"meritocracy at large\" in effect for the most part, but with opportunities promoted for marginalized groups. That is, a meritocracy that favors the poor instead of the rich.\r\n\r\nAll this meritocract quote reminds me of a quote from the Simpsons' villainous Mr Burns who tries to justify cheating in a contest during a company retreat, which gives us a different perspective:\r\n\r\n Mr. Burns: Tell me, Simpson, if an opportunity arose for taking a small short-cut, you wouldn't be averse to taking it, would you? \r\n \r\n Homer: Hmm, not as such. \r\n \r\n Mr. Burns: Neither would I. If you can take advantage of a situation in some way, it's your duty as an American to do it. Why should the race always be to the swift, or the Jumble to the quick-witted? Should they be allowed to win merely because of the gifts God gave them? Well I say, \"Cheating is the gift man gives himself.\" \r\n \r\n Homer: Mr. Burns, I insist that we cheat! \r\n \r\n Mr. Burns: Excellent!",

I outgrew scheduled television maybe more than a decade ago. I'm reminded of this because I was going through some old disks and found burned episodes of stuff like Smallville, Heroes, The Simpsons, various anime, and so on. \r\n\r\nThose were from the days before streaming though. These days an abundance of content is available online via the streaming services, no need to store all those episodes yourself. \r\n\r\nI first tried out Netflix during my three-month London stint back in 2015 (which I now realized I never wrote about). Netflix wasn't available in the PH yet, so I took the opportunity to take a free month trial which led to binge watching of shows like House and The Office when I had the opportunity to work from home. \r\n\r\nA few months after I got back from the trip, Netflix became available in the PH, January 2016! I initially figured it might not be feasible at all given how terrible the internet here was, but it performed well enough even with our old 4Mbps BayanDSL. The content library was as expected, a lot smaller than the US one was, but it was a pretty good start. It meant a lot of the Netflix original content, including the Marvel shows, were available to me on demand so it was great.\r\n\r\nSome people like to use a VPN so they get access to a larger library, but I haven't tried that. Honestly, there is already so much content in Netflix PH anyway, and if there's any non Netflix content I wanted to watch, there are other ways rather than a VPN. (The old ways still worked of course.)\r\n\r\nToday, Netflix is a staple in our household, even my nontechie dad uses it a lot, thanks to the LG smart tv we bought a while back. And the kids section helps entertain the nieces and nephews whenever they're over. For me personally, aside from the old movies and shows I'm happy with a lot of the standup content and original shows. I think even with the limited content library, Netflix PH is still pretty good value.\r\n\r\nNot content with Netflix though, I also subbed to Amazon Prime around six months back. Well, back then my primary goal was to get Twitch Prime in order to get some Eternal loot (LOL), Amazon Prime was a nice bonus. I haven't used it too much though. I've seen the new Jack Ryan series, it was pretty good. I've also watched a few old movies there, and they have a bunch of comedy series I like such as Community, The Office, Parks, etc. I'm coming up on six months for my sub though, which means I'm about to lose the discounted new subscriber rate. I don't use Amazon Prime nearly as often as I do Netflix, so I'm not yet sure whether I should keep it around.\r\n\r\nThere's definitely still a lot of holes in the streaming content available locally though - we don't have Hulu for one thing. And the new services like DC Universe and Disney+ probably won't be available here for a while. I'm hoping those companies choose to have Netflix distribute internationally in the meantime. For the regular network shows like the Arrowverse shows, I still have to use traditional less legal methods to keep up weekly. Hopefully we're moving towards a future where international viewers have the same legal streaming options available as the Western world does. \r\n\r\n(I really should cut down on my TV shows though...)",

Software development often ranks in the top 10 highest-earning careers in most countries\r\nThere is a lot of scope - you could be developing web applications, mobile applications, embedded applications, client-side, server-side, data analysis, artificial intelligence, games, etc\r\nIt is very difficult to be bored. You can always automate away the boring stuff. Different projects always present different challenges. The field is evolving rapidly so there are always new things to learn.\r\nIt is both a creative endeavor and a technical endeavor\r\nLots of opportunities for remote work/working from home, if that is your thing\r\nYou get to work with a lot of smart people\r\nAccess to a worldwide community of people who think in a similar manner. Most beginner and intermediate problems easily solved through the internet\r\nGenerally, working in a programming company is more likely to be a meritocracy - people with better technical skill are more likely to be valued\r\nThere are a lot of opportunities - if you are unhappy where you are, you can easily look for another opportunity\r\n\r\nCons:\r\n\r\nIt is not for everybody. It requires a certain type of thinking that you may or may not be used to. Typically the field needs the ability to think logically and incrementally (step-by-step through how things happen) and to understand how multiple components work and interact together. More advanced challenges will also require significant out of the box thinking\r\nAfter some time, you will tend to interpret things more literally. This is a side effect of working with computer programs that may affect your social interactions\r\nMany people outside of the field will often find it difficult to understand the amount of work that goes into a computer program. This can lead to difficult conversations, especially with clients\r\nYour nonprogrammer friends and relatives will often ask you for technical help, even though you know nothing about their printer and will most likely just google the information\r\nTypically, the industry is very bad at estimation and scheduling, leading to a lot of overtime and the corresponding stress\r\nThe field is evolving rapidly, so there is often a need for a career programmer to self-educate to remain up-to-date with current trends\r\nEncountering a highly difficult problem that no one else has been able to solve may drive you insane\r\n\r\nLink to the original answer on Quora\r\n\r\n(Annoyingly I just realized that the permalink to a Quora answer may change if the text of the answer changes, since they use the question slug instead of an id in the url.)",

Since this morning, I've been moving up and down the threshold of the Diamond I, the rank just below Master, hence frustratingly there has been little progress, less than 24 hours before the ladder reset. I usually do manage to hit Master rank a bit earlier than this, but I've been a bit busier this month for some reason, so my daily Eternal grinding had been reduced to the token one win per day. I decided to step away from the game for a while and instead write the next day's blog post (this one, obv).\r\n\r\nGrinding ranked ladders can be a bitch. You basically need to be able to get into a long win streak or have a burst of short win streaks, enough to push you over the next threshold. On average, even good players will win only a bit more than half the time in any decent ranked ladder (since presumably you are matched close to people of your own skill level), so such streaks can sometimes be frustratingly hard to come by. Ranked ladders do reflect one's play skill, at least as long as you are at a rank where you have a significant skill advantage. Once the skill gap narrows, there comes into play a significant element of getting lucky due to win streaks.\r\n\r\nMy earliest experience with ranked ladders was Warcraft III back in the early 2000s, but I don't remember taking the ladder there too seriously. Maybe because back then they didn't have the concept of ladder rewards - end of season rewards based on where you finished for that season. They didn't have the whole lootbox/cosmetics/collectibles economic model for online games back then, so there weren't really much rewards to be given out. These days I still have the RTS ranked ladder option via Starcraft II, but somehow online Starcraft is much more stressful for me now and I'm getting on with the years, so most likely my ranked ladder grinding will be focused on the less dexterity-reliant genres like CCGs.\r\n\r\nAside from Eternal, the only other game I regularly play ranked on these days is Magic Arena. Eternal is the one I'm currently grinding to Master every month though, as the Arena ladder feels a lot harder to climb. That may change in succeeding months with Wizards' recent eSports push, as doing well on the Arena ladder may give a path towards playing in high-level tournaments. Of course, I may also consider cutting down to one regular CCG instead of two, as the ladder grinding can be time-consuming on some days. In such an event, I'm sorry Eternal, but Magic is my first love among CCGs. \r\n\r\nHopefully by the time this post goes up tomorrow I'll have managed to hit my Masters rank target in Eternal. I am of course aware that this grinding is totally unnecessary - there is no significant life penalty if I don't make Masters this month. At worst I miss out on a premium legendary which I don't really need. Maybe I'm really just grinding to Masters out of habit. It should be okay, as long as I don't stress out over it too much though.",

Unfortunately Sony never gave the Vita proper support, and third parties didn't follow, so the handheld never lived up to its true potential.\r\n\r\nI haven't had much opportunity for handheld gaming the past few years, since I don't travel as much anymore. But I still pick up my PS Vita every so often, much more so than my 3DS (which my niece has absconded with anyway). And I still have a few more games there I consider part of my backlog I want to someday finish. (Namely Tales of Hearts R and Zero Time Dilemma, at the very least) And my Vita is still doing pretty well, no obvious issues, so I'm hoping it can stick around for a long while.\r\n\r\n{{ instagram Bujac3RBRht }}",

Back then they hadn't announced any details other than there would be some account migrations and single sign on, so it wasn't a big deal yet. \r\n\r\nI initially joined WebFaction back in 2008 because they were a Python-friendly and developer-friendly host that had some reasonable budget options, allowing me some space to host this blog and any side projects I wanted to deploy. At that time I was learning Django, so I needed the Python support that normal hosts don't provide. I didn't know much about cloud servers back then and the WebFaction account let me try out so much stuff despite it being shared hosting. The news above is worrying because GoDaddy does not have a good reputation and is not especially known for being developer-friendly. They are a mass-market, \"lowest common denominator\" kind of host, so I would prefer not to have them as my web host.\r\n\r\nThis week, they said in an announcement that they were moving forward with a technical evaluation of migrating everyone to GoDaddy, which kind of spells doom for the WebFaction services I'm using. Even though their email promised that \"you won't lose any of your current features or services\", but according to a recent thread on their support forums:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     One again, zero information about exactly when WebFaction services will be completely shut down.\r\n \r\n The exact date hasn't been defined yet but it is estimated to be on August 2019.\r\n \r\n     Does this mean that WebFaction's current features and services will remain the same AFTER the migration?\r\n \r\n No, WebFaction's control panel, servers and other features and services will shut down after the migration is done. The plan is to stay up and running until then.\r\n\r\nWhile they say the technical evaluation is still ongoing, in all likelihood that's it for WebFaction. For me, at least. And I'm not interested in migrating to GoDaddy. I still have a few months before I need to transition, but I guess I need to start prepping by:\r\n\r\nlooking for a new host. Any recommendations? I have a bit more experience this time with managing servers, so I'm open to a VPS instead of shared hosting, might be fun to try out for a while. Currently looking at just getting a cheap ($5/mo) droplet over at Digital Ocean. Alternatively, I could just move this blog over to netlify and any other apps I have (like TriviaStorm) over to something like Heroku, but that seems like it would cost me more money.\r\nsee if I can refund my current balance with them, since I prepaid a bit last year. I already asked on the forums and they say we'll have more info on refund options later after their technical evaluation, maybe around Mayish.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I had a good run with WebFaction, a bit over 10 years now. But time moves on and things change and small businesses get eaten up by large businesses, such is the way of capitalism. They were very developer-friendly and had pretty good customer support in my opinion, so they will be missed. Hopefully I'm able to find a good alternative.",

Unfortunately, I failed to continue that habit the very next day (hopefully I'm able to succeed on upcoming days). The main reason I failed is that I was unable to sleep early on the preceeding night. My sleep cycle is horribly irregular, given my flexible working hours. I tend to be easily tempted to take naps at odd hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot that there's anything wrong with naps mind you. But it's probably better if my naps were predictable, like say, a quick nap after lunch (when I'm likely to be sleepy anyway), instead of the irregular schedule I have now which messes up my sleep cycle.\r\n\r\nThe common advice for fixing a sleep cycle is to have a regular time of the day when you go to bed and sleep, so that your body gets used to sleeping at this time. This has proven... difficult for me.\r\n\r\nI think I really need to find the discipline to establish a regular routine, with scheduled naps throughout the day if needed. Routines have a few benefits:\r\n\r\nit makes it easier to establish new habits if they're incorporated into a routine. I noticed this with my Duolingo lessons, the past few weeks I've always been doing them right after breakfast, still sitting at the table. I bring my iPad with me during breakfast for reading the news, so it's easy to transition into the Duolingo app. Doing it a regular time and so early day makes it a lot less likely that I break the streak.\r\nit reduces the amount of decisions you need to make during the day, and can also reduce procrastination. For example, if I allocated certain hours of the day to be \"productive hours\" and some hours to be \"gaming hours\" and so on, I don't have to make that decision during the day. And I can't procrastinate on being productive, since I know the rest of my time is already allocated\r\nhaving a regular rhythm makes it easier to get through difficult days\r\n\r\nThe main downside of a routine like this is... it's boring! I dislike heavily regimented schedules that are predictably always the same. I mean, that may even be one of the reasons why I'm not working full-time anymore. I'll need to think about this some more. A kind of hybrid approach where some time blocks are more flexible might be more feasible for me, or maybe a varying schedule depending on the day. We'll see. But for sure I have to do something!",

Some would say a bad habit, especially when among company. These days my morning newspaper consists mostly of Flipboard articles, then the local newspaper during lunch and dinner if I am at home.\r\n\r\nAside from mealtime readings, I also regularly take breaks to check what is going on in social media and my RSS reader. I am, to invent a word, hyperinformed. As soon as something happens, I like to know about it. A bus exploded on EDSA the other day and I told my parents about it before it came up on local news TV. \r\n\r\nThis may be a bit of information overflow. And some even say that for the sake of our own mental health, we should avoid consuming the news too regularly. Especially these days, when the news is full of negativity: natural disasters, politicians being stupid or corrupt, crimes and atrocities, invasions of privacy, hatred, racism, war, poverty, and so on. The world can be dark, and news tends to highlight the negative, and consuming it too regularly may begin to affect our worldview.\r\n\r\nThere is a desire to stay informed of course, I still consider that a duty as a responsible citizen. To know what issues are being faced by people in our country and in the world, so that we may help craft the decisions to solve those issues. \r\n\r\nBut perhaps regular consumption is not so necessary. It might be a good idea to shift to some kind of weekly or monthly schedule of news consumption, instead of daily. The problem would be finding sources that can sum up the past week or month's news, distill it into those things important to know. This might be challenging, especially for local news. But maybe I'll start looking around.\r\n\r\nBut then what would I read during breakfast?",

Most of them will provide easily accessible backup tools, but probably they have to be accessed via a web browser. Here are the relevant pages for Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. (And be wary of sites like Quora that don't have a direct backup option.)\r\n\r\nI'm not saying these services are going to fail and shut down mind you (though that's a disinct possibility with all the controversy these days). But there's a variety of other reasons why regularly backing up your data is a good idea:\r\n\r\nthese services may decide to ban you or remove some of your content for some reason\r\nyour account might get hacked and you lose control of the account\r\nmaybe those services get some new policy that bans certain types of posts and some of your content gets purged (accidentally or not)\r\nmaybe they botch a server migration and lose all your data. (Also, goddammit Yahoo Messenger!)\r\nit makes it easier for you to quit these services if you ever decide to\r\noffline backups are easier to search and parse (for whatever reason)\r\netc\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above, my personal reason is that I prefer to have control over all the content I create. (Maybe it's just my pack rat personality.) I'm not claiming my content is fantastic mind you, but it's a matter of having self-determination. Having it existing only on another person's server means all those bits may be lost at the whim of another party. Ideally I'd have a backup of my social media content on a server that I control (in addition to on my own computers). Perhaps in the future I may consider importing all those social media posts and back-importing them into this blog even.\r\n\r\nI personally try to backup my social media stuff maybe every three months or so, that seems a reasonable rate.

So here's the first one! (stuff in italics were added during the cross-post)\r\n\r\n How can you read and study a large software project source code?\r\n\r\nAttacking a large, existing codebase that you are unfamiliar with can be a daunting endeavor. Don't expect that you will be able to easily navigate the codebase quickly after just a few days of studying it. Familiarity will come with experience.\r\n\r\nSome things that can help:\r\n\r\nDon't try to understand everything all at once. Figure out what is interesting to you and focus your efforts there\r\nFollow the path of data. Easiest way to see how the program works. For example, if I were studying a web application that processes request parameters to generate a search result, I would trace how the program captures the parameters from the requests object, formulates it into a search query, sends it to the database, receives the results, formats the results, then sends it back to the browser. Looking at the typical paths through which data traverses the system can give you a good overview of where everything is. this may be a problem if you're not familiar with the technology or framework the codebase is using, as some of the details may have too many layers of abstraction to trace. In that case, better to brush up and have a basic understanding of the tech first.\r\nTry to fix a bug or implement some sort of change. If it's an open source project, this is probably the best way to familiarize yourself with the codebase and get more involved at the same time. I'd suggest starting with minor UI bugs, those tend to be easiest to figure out since a text search of the source will often point you to where the correction needs to be made. For example, if the bug is that a particular error message is being shown under the wrong conditions, you can use a text search to find where the error message is declared, then trace all the code points that generate that message, figure out which one you need to update (probably by trial and error) and fix accordingly\r\n\r\nLink to the original answer on Quora",

I might not be explaining the concept too well, here's the thread.\r\n\r\nAnyway, in a fit of \"I'm a bit bored, anything interesting I could do?\" I figured I could set up a quick webapp to do that. I did a quick PoC in Python/Flask, with Tweepy for accessing the Twitter API. I normally prefer Django for my webapps, but since this was just a small, quick app, I figured Flask would be ideal. That worked out fine, except that I had to use my personal access tokens to for all the API calls. This means that if many people were using the app, it was likely to hit Twitter's rate limits!\r\n\r\nThat was a few months back. A couple of days ago, someone emailed me asking about an error he encountered using the app, and sure enough it was due to the rate limits. I had a couple of free hours last weekend, so I figured I'd update the app a bit. I decided to add a Twitter login requirement, that way we can use the individual user's access token instead of using mine globally. This would allow the rate limits to be per user and thus less likely to be hit. Now, I've tried implementing OAuth login some years ago and it can be terribly complicated, but luckily I found out that there's a nifty Python package called Flask-Dance that made it super easy to add Twitter OAuth to a Flask app. This also let me discard the Tweepy dependency, since the Twitter OAuth session let me query the API endpoints directly. I also did a bit of UI cleanup and error handling and deployed the changes quickly.\r\n\r\nThe app is available online at apps.roytang.net/twitter. There's a few other Twitter tools I've been meaning to build, so I'll probably put them here too when I get around to them.",

I posted the usual spoiler-free review over on Tumblr, but I have some more spoiler-y thoughts over here:\r\n\r\n\r\n{{% spoiler %}}\r\n\r\nWhile I thought the movie was ok, I was underwhelmed by the third act and specifically the lack of any serious threat for Carol to defeat towards the end of the movie. As this tumblr post explains more clearly than I ever could, perhaps the issue is that the narrative is not something targetted towards me as a man, who has not experienced the emotional gaslighting IRL that many women are exposed to. It's an interesting way to frame the narrative, and probably explains why some movies (i.e. chick flicks) really don't appeal to me.\r\n  \r\nI did enjoy most everything else about the movie, especially most of the comic book tie-ins and links to other MCU movies. I appreciated how they re-told the \"Carol getting her powers from an explosion\" and Mar-vell still being there. I appreciate the surprise that Annette Benning was Mar-Vell all along. I appreciate their reimagination of the Kree Supreme Intelligence. I appreciate that by the time Avengers Endgame or any potential Captain Marvel 2 rolls around, Monica Rambeau will be old enough to be her own superhero as well. I appreciate all the little things connecting this movie to the first Iron Man, the first Avengers, and even to Infinity War itself. I also appreciated that their depiction of the Kree did not rule out the Agents of SHIELD versions existing! (That being said, I would have appreciated an explanation for why some Kree are blue and some are not!)\r\n  \r\n{{% /spoiler %}}\r\n\r\nNot much else to report. The Arrowverse is limping along. Recent episodes of Supergirl have been great, I loved Jon Cryer as Lex Luthor, and I love how they've been able to adapt multiple comic book storylines this season such as What's So Funny About Truth, Justice, & the American Way?, American Alien and Red Son. (Excuse me, red daughter.)\r\n\r\nIn more sci-fi land, The Orville has been fantastic, with their surprise twist to the Isaac storyline culminating in one of the best space battles portrayed on TV. Star Trek Discovery is not as good, but I still like it, as it feels a lot more classic Trek than S1 and the overarching S2 plot is more interesting to me too.\r\n\r\nNext month is looking packed. The big headliners to look forward to are of course Avengers Endgame, Shazam, and the final season of Game of Thrones!",

This means that as you specialize, many of these subjects may become “irrelevant\" to you, but having this broad base of knowledge gives you a better foundation in life. Knowledge from unrelated fields can often give useful insight to your own specialized field.\r\n\r\nThat being said, the most useful stuff you learn from school isn’t the stuff that’s in the lectures or in the textbooks. The most important things you learn from school are in the methods of learning and working well with others. School teaches how to apply yourself, how to study and pick up new material, how to listen to other people, how to determine which knowledge is useful to learn, how to discern truth from fiction, how to work within a set of rules, how to manage your time, how to deal with schedules and deadlines, how to work well with other people, how to deal with difficult people, and so on. In short, the most important lesson school teaches you is how to deal with the real world.\r\n\r\nLink to the original answer on Quora\r\n\r\nEdit: Not directly related, but reposting the above made me think of this quote from Dead Poets Society.",

In fact, I may have considered it as a bit of a defining quote back then. I guess the idea was 'ok, we'll rush in and try anything, at worst we learn a lesson and be better for next time'. I think it's kind of the naive optimism that can only come with youth. \r\n\r\nAs I've grown older my views on things like self-care and burnout have evolved, and the quote seems a bit silly to you know. I mean, we all know there are things that won't kill you but can make you weaker, like depression or getting disabled or yes even burnout. \r\n\r\nAnd frankly, there are more important things than being stronger.\r\n\r\nEdit: Hey, I've posted about this quote before!",

One of the games I'd been meaning to play for a while now was Zero Time Dilemma, the third game in the Nonary Games trilogy. I've only previously played the 2nd game in the series, Virtue's Last Reward, which is a bit appropriate given how the events in these games often unfold nonlinearly. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nZTD is pretty good, but the story is understandably complex, given how it builds off a series of games that already involved espers and time travel and multiple timelines and cults and world pandemics and so on. It didn't help that it's been 4-5 years since I played VLR, and that game already had an overly complex plot so I can barely remember the details from that game as well. \r\n\r\nWhile it's a story-based series, the gameplay largely consists of two parts: (a) escape rooms; and (b) decision-making. The escape rooms part are entertaining enough, nothing too difficult, but satisfying enough to solve everything. The decision-making part is used to unlock branching timelines, and the path to the \"good\" endings is determined by your ability to find the correct decisions to unlock the correct events. Not all decisions are binary or multiple-choice; some of the more important ones require text or numeric input, making it impossible to guess them. At multiple points, you will need to reference information learned from other branches of history (don't worry, there is a story reason for why this happens).\r\n\r\nTook me a couple of weeks of playing sporadically to finish the game. I enjoyed the game enough to spend a couple of late nights to finish it once I got really going. I will shamefully admit I did get stuck in one place and in my impatience I googled my way past it. Still, a platinum is a platinum:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, given how old the first game is, it's unlikely I'm going to get to complete the trilogy. There's still a couple of other Vita games I want to play as well (notably, I'm still in the middle of a 3-year old Tales of Hearts R run), so maybe I'll get around to those... someday!",

That of course eventually led me to traipse through the internet archive's wayback machine again, especially looking back at some of my older websites.\r\n\r\nI like having the ability to dig through time and find old content I've written or created. (Which is only one of the reasons why I advocate backing up your social media content regularly). That's why I like this blog, it means I can easily look through the past and figure out what I was doing, say, in 2011. In fact, I still have a lot of old files to dig through and organize and such. One of my goals is that any old material I find that can safely be made public would be made available through this blog/site. This content is probably of interest only to myself, but that alone is good enough reason to keep them around.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, a bunch of things that regretably I can no longer access due to circumstances, such as:\r\n\r\nfiles I had from my college days at EEE. I remember having backed up stuff to a CD before, but I cannot find that CD now\r\nMy Geocities content from before 2002. I had written somewhere that I was on Geocities since 2000, but the only archive I have is from 2002 (and the wayback machine only goes back that far), and the 2002 archive is only a placeholder that links to other free hosting I had back then. I'm sure there was an older version of the site that was mostly a Final Fantasy and Rurouni Kenshin fansite that I probably got rid of because I wasn't too happy with it. It's possible that the older version was on one of the \"neighborhood\"-style Geocities URLs, as my wayback machine search is only for the \"username\"-style URL. I can't recall if I did have a neighborhood-style URL, but if I did, I don't remember it anymore.\r\nYahoo Messenger chat archives. Yahoo Messenger was officially discontinued on July 2018. They provided an export tool that supposedly would have worked until November 2018, but I had no luck with it. I read somewhere that they actually lost the old database from before 2011 or such, so there was no way of recovering it at all. I was a bit active on YM back in the day, so that's a big loss.\r\nold emails from Edsamail and Softhome (basically before Yahoo Mail and Gmail). It is unlikely these still exist in the cloud somewhere, as the norm back then was to delete the emails from the server to save space. It's possibly I have an old hard drive here somewhere that has MBOX files to be parsed though.\r\n\r\nNow that I have access to a scanner, I also wish I had kept old analog stuff like old school notebooks and such. Not because I was really good at notes, but I filled those things with off topic stuff like sketches, plans for building my own games, etc. \r\n\r\nThinking about this reminds me of a recent The Orville episode where the starship's 25th century computer is able to analyze a smartphone from 2015 and create a simulation of the life of the woman who owned the phone, based on her message history and all that. I doubt if such technology is truly feasible - the data stored in emails and messages and social media is only one aspect of modern life after all - but it's nice to imagine that as long as we archive things successfully, some version of us can still exist in the far future.",

Recently with the planning for the US trip, the worry that comes to mind is financial: this trip is expensive, should I be cutting back? Can I afford this Airbnb? Can I afford going to Disneyland with my nieces? etc. \r\n\r\nAll this worrying is silly of course. I already know I can well afford the trip, but the fact that it's so expensive triggers the spendthrift in me to worry that I might be spending too much and I might be on a slippery slope to financial ruin. Again, silly.\r\n\r\nSometimes when I'm outside I watch the people around me and such worries seem ridiculous when I realize a lot of people are worse off than me and yet they are able to thrive and survive and carry on with their lives enjoying simple things like a movie or a walk in the park. Even the poor or the unfortunate are able to enjoy daily life despite all of the problems around us. I'm reminded that I should not worry and just be grateful I can go on the trip at all, as not everyone can enjoy that privilege. Maybe someday I'll lose my privileges I do enjoy so I should take advantage of them while I can. And not worry so much, even if did manage to somehow get into financial ruin, I'm skilled and employable enough that I can still live comfortably even then.\r\n\r\nNot to be preachy or anything, but all of this also reminds me of a quote from Matthew 6:26:\r\n\r\n Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?\r\n\r\nObviously the analogy isn't perfect, because you know, birds can die and be hunted easily, but the point remains. Many are able to live their lives with much less than what I have so I should be grateful and not worry so much.\r\n\r\nDon't worry, be happy...",

The rocking was felt strongly in Metro Manila; I normally don't feel any earthquakes and only learn of them after the fact via friends or social media. But this time I was on a bed and I could feel it physically shaking, which was impressive given I was only on a second story. Imagine what it must have been like to be in a high-rise condo. Many of my friends working in the business districts had to evacuate their high-rise offices via stairs, and I put off a planned trip that afternoon to Ortigas since it looked like I might have trouble getting home if I went ahead. Thankfully all my friends and family are safe.\r\n\r\nMy last real memory of actually feeling an earthquake was the one back in 1990 that collapsed the Hyatt in Baguio. I was still in grade school then and I distinctly remember that quake hitting while we were in the parking lot waiting around for the school bus to get going. I'm sure we've had strong earthquakes since then, but none made a lasting impression.\r\n\r\nEarthquakes are not an uncommon occurrence here, but during recent years there has been talk of a devastating \"Big One\" which could theoretically do a lot of damage to Metro Manila, which meant a lot of people were worried, justifiably so. I'm disappointed that I didn't instinctively find a table or door frame to position myself under and just sat there silently as the shaking happened. I guess we should also count ourselves luckly that there weren't many casualties so far for this quake, unlike the 1990 one which was I think the second most lethal earthquake to hit the country ever. It's also a pleasant surprise how the high-rise buildings in the business districts are holding up. I worry that because of the way business is done in the Philippines, there may have been shortcuts taken that weaken their structural integrity, but fortunately that has not been the case. So far. Hopefully, we will be able to fare as well if the hypothetical \"big one\" actually hits.",

MTG War of the Spark and Avengers Endgame spoilers ahoy!\r\n\r\nEndgame #1: War of the Spark\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latest Magic set has been a home run in terms of lore and flavor and storytelling, bringing the last three years worth of MTG lore to its conclusion as the villainous dragon planeswalker Nicol Bolas aims to complete his plan to achieve omnipotence over the multiverse. The set is packed with planeswalkers summoned to Ravnica by Bolas's schemes, which means mechanically that a lot of new planeswalker design space is being explored. The spoiler season was well-executed (despite some leaks during the last week), allowing us to see the story unfolding through the cards in a clearer way than ever before: from the dreadhorde invasion of Ravnica, the counterattack by the guilds, the arrival of the Amonkhet God-Eternals, and the death and betrayal that soon followed. It remains to be seen what impact the set will have on the gameplay and the meta, but from lore and flavor alone it's already a win.\r\n\r\nEndgame #2: Avengers Endgame\r\n\r\nFirst, the spoiler-free review (mirrored from Tumblr, I figured there's no reason to publish there exclusively):\r\n\r\nAvengers: Endgame spoiler-free review!\r\n\r\nI watched Endgame exactly 365 days after watching Infinity War! (And also 3 years to the day after watching Civil War)\r\nI approve of this movie as a fitting end to the last decade of Marvel films. This is a slam dunk ending. They could end it here, with no additional MCU movies/shows coming out and that would be completely fine\r\nI approve of how little information about the movie managed to leak, I approve of the trailers and the marketing campaign: just enough to get hyped but nothing too spoilery\r\nThere is a lot to unpack, but its impossible to cover anything without getting into spoilers, but I'm very happy with the movie and the fan service, especially as a comic book fan.\r\nthe plot starts out slow and moves quickly at the end. If you have to pee, better to do it sometime during the first hour; I found myself holding my pee for the last hour of the movie and not wanting to miss anything, it was not pleasant\r\nImax was fine, but without probably also would have been fine\r\nThere is supposedly no post-credits, I wouldn't know as I couldn't hold it much longer and left mid-credits. The first half of the credits was nice though\r\nMagugustuhan ba ni Mama: No, same issue as Infinity War, too many characters to follow\r\nThey're going to earn a bajillion dollars with this one\r\n\r\nSpoilers follow:\r\n{{ spoiler }}\r\n\r\nThere are some timey-wimey concerns, but nothing a bunch of nerds wouldn't be able to rationalize quickly. So much to unpack here, so many easter eggs and fan service: Widow's death, Fat Thor, Smart Hulk, revisiting several previous movies, Steve wielding Mjolnir, Steve and Peggy's last dance, Pepper rocking the Rescue armor, the Tony Stark final sacrifice and sendoff, all the cameos from previously lost characters and villains (did they actually get Natalie Portman to shoot new footage?!?), and finally that scene where when all hope was lost, I was wondering what deus ex machine they would use to get out of the situation, and when Sam made contact I was like, that's right, everyone's back, then we get all the Avengers, Wakandans, Asgardians, Sanctorum dudes, etc and Cap going \"Avengers Assemble!\" (Hey, wheren't they already assembled?!?)\r\n\r\n{{ /spoiler }}\r\n\r\nWorth the wait, very happy with the movie, and even tempted to watch it one more time.\r\n\r\nThere is of course a third endgame that kicked off in April, and that's Game of Thrones, but it's not yet done, so I'll cover that another time.",

(More likely the problem is still being easily distracted.)\r\n\r\nThe only reasonably effective solution I've had is to use one of those plastic containers with slots for each day of the week. The idea is that at the start of the week, I should put one pill in for each day, and I would know if I'd already taken my meds for the day if the slot wasn't filled. But the problem with this solution is that sometimes I'm too lazy to populate the slots and just wing it for the week and then I'm back in trouble.\r\n\r\nSo what now?

That, and the only thing being available on TV being The Ten Commandments starring Charlton Heston and Yul Brenner. In the early 2000s, what we often watched were the marathon episodes of Seventh Heaven shown on Studio 23 (the actor for the dad/pastor in that show later on confessed to being involved in a child molestation scandal, ironically.) Back before cable TV you didn't have much of a choice, you could only watch what the local channels gave you and all the malls were closed, so you often are forced into some form of quiet reflection. These days, well, the internet.\r\n\r\nA lot of people in the Metro skip town for the Holy Week, heading off to beaches or wherever to beat the summer heat or taking advantage of the holiday to visit their family in the provinces. Our family generally doesn't do that, being practicing Catholics and all, we like to just stay at home and suffer the summer heat. The great thing about all these people leaving the city is that the normally super congested Metro Manila gets to breathe for a bit. From Maunday Thursday through Easter Sunday, traffic is the lightest it ever is for the entire year (culminating in the post-Easter traffic mess caused by all the people travelling back from the provinces). The power and water crises we've been going through for the past few weeks is temporarily alleviated as the demand from the city residents goes down - our water pressure has been pretty good since Thursday, though we did end up using more power to aircon our way through the summer afternoons.\r\n\r\nThis summer seems hotter than it has ever been, not uncommon during the past few years. It's a free pentitensya that comes with living in the Philippines that even non-Catholics have to suffer through (a joke I've made to three different chat groups now) Ignorant people who don't believe in global warming need to live closer to the equator.",

From there, I got to a link which said that the average page size nowadays is at least 3MB.\r\n\r\nThis led me to check the performance of this very blog/site. Initial load of the home page clocks in with 13 requests weighing around 140KB total. This is not bad, in fact it would be a significant improvmenet since I migrated to a static site using Hugo. The homepage of the old Wordpress version of the blog comes with 44 requests totalling a bit over 500KB. And the new homepage lists way more posts too.\r\n\r\nThe page for individual posts leaves some room for improvement however, coming at 62 requests totalling more than 2MB. The main culprit is Disqus which I use for commenting. At least Disqus uses delayed loading, so the content renders immediately, but that's still a lot of bandwidth that could be saved. Leaving aside the question of \"Do I really need comments?\", I did a quick search if there were pre-existing solutions for optimizing Disqus loading on static sites.\r\n\r\nThe best hit so far was disqusLoader, which avoids loading Disqus until the comment area actually scrolls into view. It's a neat idea, but I encountered some JS errors when I did a quick test with it. I'll revisit this again later when I have more time.\r\n\r\nAn alternative of course would be to write my own JS-based commenting engine to rival Disqus, which seems to have no competition in its particular niche. I like building things so this option naturally came to mind, but in all likelihood I don't have time to do that, and there's a good chance it may end up as heavy as Disqus anyway. \r\n\r\nNeed to think about this some more.",

And yet the very subject invites some to ask why we should even care about the feelings of rapists or murderers.\r\n \r\n Here's why we need to care. We need to care because our justice system demands it. Regardless of where we stand on the appropriateness of a death penalty, we must agree that the administration of any punishment must be done in the absence of passion or cruelty. Whether we're putting someone to death, locking them up for shoplifting, interrogating them in a criminal case or holding them while we determine their legal residency status, we must be adamant in our commitment to do so in a way that's free from resentment or rage… or amusement.\r\n \r\n Why is this so important? It is important because when we allow anger and apathy to seep into our justice system we begin to do unjust things. We keep prisoners in tents whose temperatures reach 114 degrees. We lock them in solitary confinement and laugh as we watch them die of a seizure. We surround them at a traffic stop and kick them in the stomach and face while they lay handcuffed and helpless. We end up with a Supreme Court justice who erupts in a blind rage when his fitness is questioned. We end up with a president who admonishes police not to \"go so easy\" on suspects when apprehending them, a president who leads cheers of \"lock them up\" whenever he brings up a political opponent.\r\n \r\n We lose our way.\r\n \r\n The very existence of a criminal justice system is an agreement where the public allows its government to suspend – or even eliminate – some of the rights outlined in our constitution. In doing so we expect our government to exercise this power with the utmost care and respect, even for those accused or convicted of the most serious offenses. Because to do otherwise invites vengeance into our system. Vengeance and justice cannot coexist; one will always replace the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm reminded of how in our country, there are politicians advocating for the death penalty in response to the supposed drug menace, when there has generally been no evidence to show the death penalty deters crime. The last time we had the death penalty, only one convict was ever executed, the country did not have the stomach for it. I imagine (based only on the perceived behavior of our politicos) that those advocating for the death penalty do not really have deterrence in mind, but rather punishment - they wish to cruelly punish the offender to satisfy the bloodlust of the populace. i.e. Vengeance, not justice.",

The meaning of the comic changes significantly in the context of the webcomic, as the titular girl minus apparently has unlimited reality alteration powers.

It reminds me a bit of notable Ruby programmer why the lucky stiff, who also chose to withdraw from the internet because he wanted to be left alone. \r\n\r\nIt's too bad Ryan Armand is no longer doing webcomics, as minus was pretty good. You can read minus' archives via the internet archive or here are some on Comic Vine.",

I’m just a little wary of the smartphone market right now. I don’t currently feel at ease developing for those platforms because the SDKs change, their hardware specs change and when you don’t update the game just breaks.\"\r\n\r\nI noticed this a while back when I was looking at what games I had previously purchase for my iPad on Apple's App Store and found that many of the older purchases are either no longer available for download or simply don't work anymore. (I imagine that Android has a similar issue, but I've never purchased anything from the Play Store, so I won't bother to check.) For this reason, I have resolved never again to pay for any games on mobile. (Actually the last purchase was as far back as 2013). \r\n\r\nUnlike consoles where the platform SDK is locked in for an entire generation, mobile app SDKs are updated on a regular basis, which means mobile game devs need to support the equivalent of new console platforms more than once a year. Mobile gaming fares even worse than PC gaming, despite the wide variety of PC configurations, the software-level support for games is pretty much standardized at the OS-level and companies like Microsoft are careful to support backward compatibility.\r\n\r\nOne of my pipe dreams is of course to get into game development, and for a while I considered mobile as a possible option for that (if I ever get around to it), but with the state of the ecosystem these days that seems unlikely.",

I figured I might as well get everything out. There will be unmarked spoilers for Avengers Endgame and Agents of SHIELD.\r\n\r\nBefore even going into the movie that was seemingly sold out everywhere despite being on almost every cinema screen in the Metro, I was thinking to myself what a phenomenon. Endgame is the culmination of a decade's worth of movies, 22 in total, and even some number of shows, something unrivalled in all of movie history. It's a new form of serialized event entertainment - even though there have been movie franchises with continuity before, most have been limited to trilogies, and the MCU blows them all out of the water. In my head it's more akin to an extended HBO or Netflix series, one that only gets three episodes a year, and each episode is an event in that you can go to the cinema and watch it with your friends. And Endgame was here, trying to put a bookend on all of that, an entire decade worth of stories, with dozens of characters and the stakes no less than half the universe. The scale of it is mind-boggling and very ambitious, and if they dropped the ball on this one it would be so terrible and a huge waste and it would take another decade to even attempt to conclude another story in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe movie starts with the cold open of Clint and his family getting dusted. This could have easily been done as a post-credits scene in Infinity War, but having this here allows them to remind the audience of the stakes involved at the very start. (And saves them having to credit Jeremy Renner in both movies.)\r\nNext we get the trailer scene of Tony in space recording his message to Potts. The trailer makes this out to be kind of a hopeless-we're-about-to-die situation for Tony (and Nebula), but the movies resolves it quickly by having Carol come in to save them at the last minute. At first I was confused a bit about whether we were going to see the Captain Marvel post-credits scene in this movie, but they save some time by having all of that (including introducing Carol to everybody and explaining Thanos and all) happen off-screen. Tony gets back to Earth but he's still pissed at cap and they part ways.\r\nWith Nebula now on Earth, they know where Thanos is and the plan is to go beat him up, get the stones and use that to resotre all the dusted people. But Thanos has destroyed the stones, making the snap apparently irreversible. Thor is frustrated and goes for the head this time, and we timeskip five years.\r\nBoth the timeskip and the length of it caught me a bit off-guard, I wasn't expecting it. I can imagine that Infinity War could've ended here too (if not for the pesky detail of Carol not yet being introduced.) Aparently five years was not enough for the people of the world to move on. That's understandable, but I would have assumed they would clean up the mess a little bit.\r\nNext we have the rat that saves the world. Pure blind luck gets Scott out of the Quantum Realm; the only reason it took five years to get to this point is that rat was lazy.\r\nContinuing the MCU tradition of trying to complete the Community cast, we get a 2-second cameo by Ken Jeong/Senor Chang. Later on we also get a slightly longer cameo from Yvette Nicole-Brown/Shirley!\r\nScott gets to meet grown-up Cassie, setting up the stage for her Phase 4 adventures as Stature, and perhaps, the Young Avengers? Who else would be there?\r\nAfter some meandering, Scott makes his way to the Avengers compound, and finally explains his ludicrous timey-wimey plan of using the quantum realm to do a time heist. They need someone smart to figure this out so they go to Tony, and we get to meet his daughter Morgan (I would guess at 4 years old). Tony dismisses their plan as some fantasy Back to the Future-type nonsense. Apparently (as would be explained further on), Back to the Future rules do not apply in the MCU - changing the past does not affect the future. I initially thought they would try to use time travel to go back and redo the battle of Wakanda, this time with more foreknowledge and Carol on their side and thus stop the snap from even happening, but this throws that out the window. There's no getting around it now - the snap is irrevocably part of MCU history and future films will have to work around that or otherwise deal with the consequences.\r\nThey need another smart guy, so they go see Bruce, who is now Smart Hulk. Not what I was expecting, though not unprecedented from the comics. Banner has had a weird character arc since Age of Ultron, going from permanently Hulk to unable to Hulk and now both Banner and Hulk.\r\nTony figures it out and comes around, so they try to get the gang back together to do the Time Heist. Rocket and Bruce go to pick up Thor, who is now a depressed fat drunk idiot apparently. Far Thor is a bit of a disservice to the character - but given that during the last few movies he's lost his mother and his father and his girlfriend and his home and his posse and half the remaining Asgardians and he feel responsible for the snap because he didn't go for the head, maybe it's a little justified. Hey, at least Valkyrie and Korg survived, so that's something.\r\nNatasha tracks Clint swordfighting some Yakuza in Tokyo and gives him hope.\r\nSo the Time Heist crew are: Steve, Tony, Bruce, and Scott going for the three infinity stones in New York 2012, Rocket and Thor going for the Ether in Asgard 2013, Nebula, Rhodey going for the power stone on Morag in 2014, and Clint and Natasha going for the Soul Stone in 2014 as well. They only get one round trip each, so no one is allowed to fail\r\nI was pleasantly surprised all the appearances of characters from previous movies: the Ancient One, Rumlow, Agent Sitwell, Loki, Alexander Pierce, Frigga, even Natalie Portman's Jane Foster! Did they actually get Portman to shoot a scene gain, or just reused footage from Dark World? (I assume the latter). Tt's amazing that they were able to shoot new scenes with actors like Tilda Swinton and Robert Redford and not have that info leak\r\nSome great throwback moments include:\r\n  \"I can do this all day\" \"Yeah, yeah\"\r\n  the Ancient One punching Bruce out of the Hulk\r\n  the elevator scene from Winter Soldier turned on its head by Cap whispering \"Hail Hydra\"\r\nCap, Iron Man and Hulk going back to the battle of New York made sense, since they could blend in during the fight somehow and Tony has access to Stark tower\r\nThor does his blubbering idiot thing but gets a bit of his mojo back after talking to his mother and finding out he was still worthy to summon Mjolnir\r\nOnce you know that Clint and Natasha are going for the Soul Stone, you already know one of them has to die; the only question was which one. Natasha unfortunately, did not have a spouse and children to go back to\r\nRhodey and Nebula successfully conk out idiot Peter Quill and grab the Power Stone from him. It's weird that they chose to go back to this time instead of say, after Gotg1 when the power stone was safely in the hands of the Nova Corps. I guess they figured it was easier to get it from Quill rather than try to infiltrate Xandar, but coming back to this time creates an opportunity for Nebula to get her wifi network crossed with 2014 Nebula and so 2014 Thanos finds out about the entire Time Heist and sends 2014 Nebula back to 2023 as a sleeper agent\r\nSteve and Tony hop to 1970 as their back up plan for getting the tesseract. Steve catches a glimpse of Peggy, but she looks a bit too young considering she should be 50ish at this time. Tony meets up with Howard and I am momentarily confused because I am more familiar with Dominic Cooper than John Slattery but here we are. Howard saying Tony is about to be born tells us Tony is more than 50 in 2023, quite old already as well. Oh, and Jarvis is here too.\r\nThe Time Heist is successful! Everyone but Nat makes it back home, and they mourn her for all of ten seconds before going to build their own Infinity Gauntlet. She probably deserved more than that, but she is still slated for an upcoming movie, however that works, and this movie is all about a sendoff for Cap and Tony, so she gets less focus\r\n(As the third act is beginning, I suddenly get the urge to pee, but I can't go now! And I'm in the middle of the row so going would bother a lot of people and I end up uncomfortably holding it in for an hour. This is my excuse in case I screw up some facts below)\r\n2014 Nebula brings 2014 Thanos and his warship through the time machine into the present day. One would wonder how they got enough Pym particles to shrink the entire warship, but presumably they had enough time to study and clone the tech before 2014 Nebula called to them. The ship did not pop out full size in Avengers compound as I expected, instead appearing in the sky above\r\nBruce prepares to use the gauntlet, and without explanation everyone suits up, as if expecting they're about to be attacked by the Mad Titan they thought they killed a while back. Bruce snaps, and a phone call confirms the undusting worked, but then they get space bombarded by Thanos' warship\r\nClint is left alone to run away with the gauntlet to protect it from beasties. The original three (Steve, Tony and Thor) go face to face with Thanos directly. Thor, probably bursting with a chance to redeem himself, dual wields Stormbreaker and Mjolnir and uses the lightning to get out his sweatpants and fashion himself new armor and braid his beard. They go at it\r\n2014 Gamora frees 2023 Nebula and they go save Clint just when 2014 Nebula was about to take the gauntlet from him. Bruce is trying to keep the rubble from collapsing on Rhodey, Rocket and himself as Scott heads their way\r\nThanos vs the original three is a close fight, but the Mad Titan has them on the ropes when suddenly Steve wields Mjolnir! Completely predictable, but it's something the fans have been clamoring for since Age of Ultron. Thor cheers \"I knew it!!\"\r\nIn spite of everything, Thanos beats them back, shattering Steve's shield. Steve struggles to get up, barely breathing, and all seems lost when he gets some radio comms from somewhere. It's Sam! Right, all the dusted people are back! Took them long enough! \"On your six\" is a throwback to their jogging days back during Winter Soldier\r\nMagic portals from Doctor Strange's peeps pop up all over, and the reinforcements are here: T'Challa, Shuri, Okoye and the armies of Wakanda! Sam, Bucky, Wanda, Quill, Drax and Mantis! Peter Parker, Spider-man! Pepper in the Rescue Armor! Hope van Dyne! Valkyrie and the Asgardians! Wong and his magic friends! 2014 Gamora and 2023 Nebula! Scott goes Giant-Man and busts Bruce, Rhodey and Rocket out of the rubble! Thanos calls down his armies, the Black Order and the Leviathans from the battle of New York. Everyone is geared up for a rematch of Wakanda, and Steve finally utters those magic words: Avengers Assemble! (We're already assembled, Steve!). Hands down the best moment of the movie!\r\nNot much to say about the battle itself, its great and everyone has their moments. I don't have a problem with the whole girl power moment after Carol comes in\r\nTony's response of \"I am Iron Man\" as he snaps his gauntlet is weird but I understand why it's there. His journey begins and ends with that line. His body can't take the power of infinity and he dies. Pepper tells him its time to rest\r\nTony gets a long funeral scene, and some characters notably appear for the first time in the movie: Janet van Dyne, Maria Hill, Nick Fury and some teenager I don't recognize but later find out is supposed to be the kid from Iron Man 3. Some posts are also naming him as \"Iron Lad\", which doesn't jive with the Young Avengers Iron Lad origin, but I suppose it's a possible future something\r\nAnd now, the weakest part of the movie's plot: Steve going back to the past to return the infinity stones (and Mjolnir) to where they got them, to minimize timestream damage. So many questions: \r\n  Why is Steve the only one to go? Hank Pym is back, they can make more Pym Particles again. \r\n  Why is his shield whole again? Did Shuri repair it? \r\n  Did he go back to Asgard and inject the ether back into Jane Foster? \r\n  How did he make the tesseract a cube again? How did he put the mind stone back into the sceptre which he didn't bring? \r\n  How did the reunion with Red Skull on Vormir go? Did he get a refund on the price paid for the Soul stone? \r\nThere are a bunch of timey-wimey problems but probably there are multiple ways to justify things and you shouldnt think about them too hard and just accept them. For the record, here is what I believe. Presumably, returning the infinity stones to where they got them removes the branch timeline that was created when they originally got them. This means:\r\n  Returning the time stone to the Ancient One means the events of Doctor Strange still happen in the prime timeline, and that time stone was the same one Thanos used in Infinity War\r\n  Returning the sceptre to Agent Sitwell means it still has the same mind stone used in Age of Ultron etc.\r\n  Returning the space stone (now Tesseract) to the SHIELD vaults means it does all of its stuff in the prime timeline as expected, and is still the same space stone used in Infinity War\r\n  Returning the ether to Jane Foster means the events of Dark World still unfold as they did\r\n  All of these are merged back into the prime timeline via TV Tropes: You Already Changed The Past, so they all already happened in the prime universe. This means four of the stones used in Infinity War and later destroyed were also the same ones used in Endgame\r\nHowever, there are at least two changes Steve would have been unable to repair:\r\n  Loki escaping with the Tesseract in 2012\r\n  The removal of 2014 Thanos, Gamora, Nebula and all of Thanos' crew from their time. This means it was also unnecessary to return the power stone and soul stone to this branch timeline, but I guess they did it anyway\r\nAnother mystery is in what timeline did Steve get his last dance with Peggy and hence grow old etc. The fact that he was able to appear on the bench as an old man shortly after being sent back implies to me that he grew old in the prime timeline (in yet another instance of You Already Changed The Past), and that Peggy simply kept the real identity of her husband a secret to her dying day\r\nThe real problem with this whole affair character-wise is that it means Steve became selfish and chose to live out his life given the chance, instead of going back to his friends as expected. I like to think that seeing Peggy again in 1970 made him realize he was always meant to be with her and thus made him decide to do what he did\r\nHanding off the shield to Sam: I expected it to be Bucky, given that in the comics he got to be Cap before Sam, but this is okay too. Though I think Steve could've given Bucky a few parting words as well\r\nQuill pretty much got the short end of the stick in IW/EG: Fans hate him now for screwing up the battle on Titan, his girlfriend is dead, and now his leadership of the Guardians is in question\r\nNotable deaths/absences:\r\n  2018 Gamora truly dead and gone. No explanation given for what happened to 2014 Gamora, as she wasn't shown being dusted. Presumably we'll see her and Thor again in Guardians 3\r\n  No Vision this time, but presumably Shuri would be able to restore him sans mind stone, especially since he and Wanda are slated for a Disney+ show\r\n  Natasha dying was sad, but she is slated for a solo movie, and EG leaves at least two outs for her coming back: one is via a Soul Stone refund as mentioned above, and another is Bruce saying he tried to bring her back when he did the snap\r\n  An Agent Coulson appearance would have been nice, although he presumably died after the end of the last season of Agents of SHIELD. This movie also leaves Agents of SHIELD in a weird place: in the last season they had Infinity War happening concurrently with the season finale, and they delayed the start of season 6 until after Endgame, but given that they now have to live with a 5-year time gap where half the people are dead, IDK if they'll have to adapt their scripts to that\r\nIn future movies, they now have access to a time machine! They can't change the past, but they can do silly things like bring back dead characters to help lol\r\nFuture movies also have to deal with the fact that half the population skipped ahead 5 years and also that the world is a mess. Things certainly didn't look like a mess in the Far From Home trailer though. Presumably Peter Parker's friends Ned, MJ and Flash all got dusted in IW so that they are all still the same age in Far From Home\r\n\r\nWhew, I wrote a lot! I guess it's justified given how much I liked the movie and the scale of it and everything. As I mentioned in the spoiler-free review, they could end the MCU here and it would be fine. A fitting end and tribute to the past decade of movies. I am even tempted to watch it in the cinemas a second time, maybe I'll have even more insights then!",

So I thought I'd follow some newer ones. Here are some short reviews:\r\n\r\nThe Promised Neverland\r\n\r\nI picked up this one due to a strong recommendation from someone I follow on social media. The premise starts out with some super smart kids who grew up in an orphanage without any knowledge of an outside world. Suddenly they find out that not all is as it seems and that they are actually captives in some kind of human farm for strange \"demons\" to consume. The first arc consists of the oldest kids trying to figure out a way to outsmart their captors and escape and find out the truth of what is happening in the outside world. (The previous two sentences aren't too spoiler-y, this setup is pretty much established in the first issue.) The 3 oldest kids are supersmart, so much of the tension lies in them trying to stay two steps ahead of their captors who suspect they know the secret, and at the same time trying to figure out a way to escape with more than 30 kids, some of them toddlers.\r\n\r\nSome spoilers for the second arc follow:\r\n\r\n{{ spoiler }}\r\n\r\nThe second arc after they manage to escape involves them trying to survive in a world that they find to be mostly populated by demons, some of them cunning like humans, and some wild and savage, all of them much stronger than humans. Sometimes writers won't know what to do after their initial premise, but The Promised Neverland handles it well; after the initial \"Prison Break\" story arc they successfully transitioned into a \"Wilderness Survival\" arc that reminds me a lot of Claymore. During the course of their journey to find a safe haven they learn the truth of why the world is like it is which eventually leads to a \"Revolution\" arc (currently ongoing) where the protagonists are trying to change the nature of this world. There were some fantastic battle scenes against overwhelming odds in the second arc as well, especially against Lewis and the other demons at Goldy Pond.\r\n\r\n{{/ spoiler }}\r\n\r\nThe Promised Neverland is currently at 130 issues and I enjoyed it a lot. The writing is good, the artwork is not too complicated yet dynamic and flowing. \r\n\r\nDr. Stone\r\n\r\nI remember reading about this one a couple of years ago about promising new series in Shonen Jump, but at that time I chose to start Robot x Laserbeam instead, which didn't last too long. I didn't start this one back then because I honestly wasn't a fan of the art style, but I gave it another shot last week.\r\n\r\nThe premise is that sometime in 2015 (?), a mysterious petrification beam turned every human being (and swallow) on earth into stone. The protagonist Senku is a genius-level science nerd who manages to keep his consciousness alive for the 3,700 years that it takes until he is freed from his petrification by a mysterious liquid. By this time, human civilization has collapsed, and all that remains is the preserved stone statues of the humans (and swallows). A firm believer in science, Senku resolves to use his analytical skills to restore human civilization, his first task being to study the mysterious liquid that freed him and use it to free some other nearby humans - the first one being his friend Taiju, who has unnaturally high endurance making him suitable for doing the hard labor neded to support Senku's science. While they are in the process of attempting to free a third human, they are beset upon by wild animals and have to run. They have no choice but to use their depetrification formula to free a nearby human who turns out to be a super-strong and athletic fighter who can defeat wild animals with his bare hands, Tsukasa. (All of this happens in the first three issues.)\r\n\r\nAfter things settle down, Senku finds out that Tsukasa hates the modern world and does not want to bring everyone back, and he starts smashing statues of older people. Fundamentally disagreeing on the way forward, this sets up the first major arc for the series, with Tsukasa taking control of the depetrification formula to establish his own empire, and Senku vowing to start a Kingdom of Science to advance human civilization and overcome Tsukasa.\r\n\r\nThe interesting thing about this series is how focused it is on science, detailing the steps needed to do complicated things like formulating chemicals or building complicated devices like a crossbow or a battery. The series is only 100 issues long so far, but thanks to Senku being ridiculously knowledgable, science advances quickly even in this \"Stone\" age.\r\n\r\n{{ spoiler }}\r\n\r\nBy the 100th issue, Senku has advanced the cause of science enough to be able to create (with the help of a whole village of people) such advanced devices as mobile communicators, a steam engine-powered boat, and even a carbon-fiber tank.\r\n\r\n{{/ spoiler }}\r\n\r\nI must admit I can't follow the science myself too closely (since I'm not that well-versed in chemistry), so I can't vouch for its accuracy, but I enjoy how it is presented and how Senku explains things. \r\n\r\nBoth of these series feature superoptimistic protagonists who are hypercompetent and very resolved to save everyone (sometimes even their enemies), no matter the ridiculous odds. A bit trope-y, but I enjoyed both series nonetheless, and both are still ongoing, so I have new manga to look forward to every week!",

You know the kind of rabbit holes I'm talking about: you just want to lookup the name of that actor who appeared in that movie and suddenly you find yourself forty minutes into a Wikipedia dive with three different tabs open, none of them remotely related to what you were originally searching for. (Wikipedia could also be IMDB, Reddit, or TV Tropes). \r\n\r\nThere's also the rabbit holes of video games - I've probably spent like 20 hours over the long weekend picking up a 2017 save game of Tales of Hearts R on my Vita. I've finished the game, but then there's the post game and the New Game+ etc. So maybe not a review yet. I was really just looking to see what options I'd have to keep myself entertained during the long plane rides I have scheduled in a couple of months.\r\n\r\nThere's also the rabbit hole of streaming TV - I've found out that 30 Rock is on Amazon Prime Video so I'm about halfway through season five right now (don't worry, I started with season four because APV likes to have random seasons for some reason). This show is great to rewatch and has a lot of ridiculous lines that I wish I could quote in real life.\r\n\r\nSo that's my long weekend. Not that I haven't been productive at all. I did manage to dive into the rabbit hole of spring cleaning a bit, moving things around and dusting and throwing things into a garbage bag at 11:30 in the evening, and that satisfied my OC-ness for a bit. But there were some side projects I wanted to get into and and didn't get to, and so on.\r\n\r\nI think falling down rabbit holes is okay, as long as you recognize what's happening to you and you have the self-control to pull yourself back as needed. Everything in moderation, as they say. Today is a Monday, so back to dreary real-life responsibilities and less rabbits for now I guess.",

These are called Shaggy Dog Stories, there's even a subreddit for them.\r\n\r\nThe ones I heard the most growing up were from my high school crowd, and I remember two of them:\r\n\r\nthe \"bloop bloop\". Basically, a kid is asked what he wants to do when he grows and he says \"I want to invent the bloop-bloop!\" and the story proceeds to describe the kid's academic growth track and at every milestone he repeats the same goal; he takes a number of courses, joins research projects, and at the end he announces that he has finished his life goal and invites everyone to a demonstration. He takes out a small round object and drops into a vat of liquid, where it makes the sound \"bloop bloop\"\r\nthe pink table. A kid is asked what he wants for his birthday, and he says \"I want a pink table!\", but his parents get him something else. This scenario repeats every year. But I forget how this one ends.\r\n\r\nI tried Google searching for the above stories, but because these were largely transmitted via verbal narration in the pre-internet days, it is unlikely there are \"standard\" versions of these shaggy dog stories recorded online.\r\n\r\nThe most famous shaggy dog story I do know of is of course, Nate the Snake. (The wayback machine tells me this site and domain have been up since 2012, that's neat, I'd have at least put ads on it by now!)",

If you're not familiar, it's basically a thought experiment along the lines of \"if a given ship's parts are replaced at every port it visits, and eventually none of the parts are from the original ship, is it still the same ship?\" The thought experiment questions the meaning of identity of a whole composed of many individual parts, such as a ship, or even a human.\r\n\r\nI thought about this while I was digging through time (read: old posts) the other day. In all these years I've been blogging, I don't feel like I've fundamentally changed, I still feel like I'm the same person I was back then writing those posts, and yet at the same time I know I've grown and adapted in many different ways. \r\n\r\nPeople change over time of course, but in terms of identity I tend to think of it as something like a codebase that undergoes version control. At any given point of time there is a version of you, slightly different from who you were yesterday or who you will be tomorrow, but still fundamentally the same. As time passes, the person you are adapts to the path and circumstances you travel, resulting in the next versions. All of this reminds me of this quote:\r\n\r\n \"No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.\" - Heraclitus",

Some years back I jokingly put \"a shredder\" on a Secret Santa wishlist, which I knew was way outside the roughly $10 range that locals usually set for Secret Santa gifts. I put a lot of other options on (usually food stuff like quezo de bola or Spam), so I wasn't expecting to actually get a shredder. But I did!\r\n\r\nIt might be a bit weird to have a shredder at home, but I find it useful (occasionally). I use it mainly for shredding credit card and bank statements, for those accounts that still insist on sending me paper mail. I have this healthy bit of paranoia about having bank info on paper, since I know even an account number might be usable for social engineering attacks vs unsuspecting call center agents.\r\n\r\nThis paranoia extends even for the shredded papers. Mostly because of a scene in the movie Batman Returns where Danny DeVito's Oswald Cobblepot was able to get dirt on Christopher Walken's Max Shreck by painstakingly reconstructing shredded documents that had been disposed off in the sewers. So sometimes I like to dispose of the shredded papers in different batches instead of throwing them all out together. \r\n\r\nThis was probably the best gift I've ever gotten from a Secret Santa, I'm still using it years later!",

I bought all three releases as soon as they came out and recently found the boxes while spring cleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite the game's age surprisingly people are still playing it, including me. Not for the ranked ladder - whenever I go into the competitive multiplayer mode I find myself stressing out and feel like my blood pressure is going up and I can't manage more than one or two games at a time. I still am able to find ranked matches, but they always feels so intense, and you have to worry about being cheesed and yes I often do poorly. The mode I'm enjoying these days is Starcraft 2 Co-op, a mode which was released together with Legacy of the Void. Some friends of mine have been playing the coop mode recently and I got enticed to join in on the fun.\r\n\r\nBasically there are mission maps similar to the campaign missions, except they require two players working together to accomplish objectives. You can choose between a few difficulty levels and play with friends, or queue up to be matched with anons. There are a number of different coop commanders available with different army compositions and special abilities. Completing missions gains you experience for the commander you chose, which lets you level them up to gain upgrades. A few come fully unlocked, some are unlocked because I had purchased all three campaigns. The ones that are locked you can still play up to level up, after that they need to be purchased for $4.99 per commander. There's a lot of content too even after you've maxed the levels, as there are mastery and ascencion levels to be climbed, and there are weekly \"mutation\" variants that are much more challenging than the normal missions. One thing I like about Starcraft 2 is that there are a lot of achievements, and that includes coop mode too so that adds a lot of replay value for me as well.\r\n\r\nI have been enjoying the mode, and due to various freebies, I initially had nine commanders unlocked. I enjoy playing a variety of styles so I levelled them all to max, and the mode is fun enough that I am considering purchasing a few of the locked commanders as well. (Maybe all of them!) It's a lot less stressful than ranked, you don't have to worry about being cheesed (and sometimes you get to do the cheesing yourself!), and a lot less toxic, people are generally friendly and don't blame you too much for screwing up. I'm a bit old so my reflexes probably aren't good enough for ranked anymore, but I'm happy I can still play in real-time well enough for the highest difficulties of coop mode.\r\n\r\nThere was some discussion in in-game chat about how the game was \"dead\", but these sentiments seemed to come mostly from people who preferred competitive multiplayer modes, so maybe not many people are playing ranked anymore? But coop seems to be going strong - I never have trouble matching up even with anons. Apparently Coop mode has been profitable enough for Blizzard that they've still been releasing new content for it fairly recently, last year saw the release of the latest coop commander Zeratul, and there are more commanders rumored to be in development. So I guess somehow the business model is working for them which is great since it gives the game legs to go on for a few more years. \r\n\r\nSide note: I really dig the packaging for all 3 SC2 games and am glad I got them physical copies. There are some nice artworks on the boxes and some inserts with a bit of lore, and Legacy of the Void even came with some free codes for WoW and Hearthstone (I wonder if I can still claim this free pack lol)\r\n\r\n",

But the teeth thing is really important, it's most probably up there somewhere in the top five.\r\n\r\nI don't have a good record of taking care of my teeth. I visited the dentist Friday last week and warned her as such. I knew from a years-long ago check up that I had several teeth that would need to be pulled but never followed up. And last week's checkup confirmed that. I scheduled a second visit today to get some of them pulled. I'm writing this post before the visit, so if I don't write a post tomorrow, maybe I died from the procedure or something. Does that happen? Do people die from teeth pulling?\r\n\r\nObviously I'm not looking forward to the visit, but it's something I've put off for too long. I'm not fond of visiting the dentist (who is?) even though I should know better about how it's necessary. I especially don't like the idea of getting my teeth pulled. I have a pretty low tolerance for pain, and there's always the anxiety before the actual visit. There was one time I made a blog post about an eternity of pain due to a toothache, and my dentist happened to read the post and jokingly (maybe?) complained to me about it. \r\n\r\nNot taking care of my teeth is probably one of my worst regrets in life. It often makes it difficult for me to chew! I know we have a lot of urgent world problems that science could help us with, but if I was allowed to selfishly genie-wish for one scientific innovation to suddenly occur it would be the ability for medical science to regrow human teeth PAINLESSLY. Sure, civilization would probably collapse due to climate change and resource scarcity, but at least I'd have my teeth back.\r\n\r\nUpdate: I'm alive! The procedure was a lot less uncomfortable than I thought it would be. Maybe I'm misremembering how bad previous extractions were? Or maybe dental anesthesia technology has advanced since then? In either case I am grateful, yet I have to go back again next week so that more of my teeth may die.",

An example going to the dentist. (Nobody enjoys going to the dentist right?) You can't just put it off forever, so you just want to get it done as fast as possible.\r\nand then there are the tasks you enjoy, the tasks you look forward to getting done, the tasks that give you a feeling of pride and accomplishment when you turn them in. And when you turn the task in, it leaves you wanting for more.\r\n\r\nWhether a particular task falls under the first group or the second group may vary from person to person. (Except possibly the dentist. Again, nobody enjoys going to the dentist, right?). But I would guess one of the things that leads to a more satisfying life would be finding ways to minimize the number of tasks you do under the first group and maximizing the second group.",

I was like, why not? My schedule is flexible, I've never been there, and going to the US meant adding a whole new continent to my experiences. Getting a US Visa was a good idea anyway, in case I ever decided to travel there for some other reason (i.e. I miraculously get a slot in a MTG Mythic Championship or something), and it was a good chance to spend some time with family for a while. It might also be the last time my parents are able to take such a long trip, so might as well take the chance.\r\n\r\nThe US Visa screening process has a reputation for being a bit difficult, with many stories of being rejected for random reasons, but I wasn't too worried. In the end, it turned out easier to get the US Visa than to get the Schengen visa for the Europe trip a few years back.\r\n\r\nThe process is actually pretty straightforward. For the Philippines, there's a website to help guide you, all the instructions are there, you just have to follow it. You can do most of the things except for the personal interview online as well. The steps I did were:\r\n\r\nFill up and submit the online form. This includes uploading a photo to be used in the visa, they have some guidelines to follow. I considered using a webcam photo, but apparently that was a bad idea. Go to a photo studio, they know what kind of picture you need, ask for a digital copy so you can upload it.\r\nMake an online payment (they have a couple of options, I did BPI Online). The fee is like $160 for a tourist visa.\r\nSchedule an interview appointment. The first available slot may be weeks out, but sometimes slots open up earlier for some reason. During one of my earlier checks I thought I'd have to wait til May to get a slot, but by the time I actually submitted the form and made the payment, there was a March slot freed up.\r\nPrepare any supporting documents you want to bring to the personal interview. You are not actually required to bring any documents, but the website above will give you a list of suggested documents to bring, depending on your visa type and purpose of visit. Everyone I asked actually said the documents they brought weren't needed, but better to be sure of course. I ended up preparing bank statements, certificate of employment, payslips, and tax returns. \r\nOn your scheduled date, go to the US Embassy in Manila for your interview\r\n\r\nThe interview itself was straightforward, but before you get even there, there's at least six different queues you have to go through:\r\n\r\nwaiting outside the embassy for applicants in your time slot (there will be around 50 applicants per time slot)\r\nqueueing at the embassy entrance so the staff can inspect your appointment papers and tell you where to go\r\nqueueing in a holding area outside the processing building. There's seats, and they'll let people proceed to the next step one row of seats at a time. There's snacks and water you can buy here, but it felt awkward to buy because you don't know when your row might suddenly be called to go ahead. Also, this is the last time you get to stay seated for the entire process, once you go in you might have to stand in line(s) for about an hour\r\n(step 1) pre-screening. A Filipino embassy staff member will review your documents and your photo. If you didn't upload a photo when you submitted the form online, they'll ask you to go to a photo taking area and get a photo taken and come back to their counter\r\n(step 2) biometrics. There's a helpful American at this window who will take your fingerprints\r\n(step 3) interview. An American will be asking you questions and they will pass or fail your visa application on the spot.\r\n  \r\nSome people take a lot longer than others at step 3, and it can make you a bit anxious when you can see the person in front of you being grilled intensely. One lady in a window in front of me was asked how long she planned to stay, and she said \"one to five months\" and the interviewer seemed irritated at the vagueness of the reply. \"Which is it, one month or five months, those are completely different!\" Another lady and her son said they wanted to visit a sick relative and they had to present a certification from the doctor. \r\n\r\nMy interview was pretty straightforward, I didn't even need any of the documents I prepared. The guy asked me about my purpose of travel, where I had travelled before, and what kind of work I did. He drilled down a bit into the work question, asking me what kind of software I did, which I suspect was just to make sure I wasn't BSing him about being a dev. Overall my time at the window didn't take more than five minutes I think, and he said \"Ok, I'm approving your application and you'll get your visa in a week.\"\r\n\r\nI think you don't have anything to worry about as long as you're honest about your reasons for travelling (no intention to deceive) and you're confident (don't look sketchy, which should be easy if you're honest!). I would imagine being able to communicate well in English also helps a lot, that's a bit elitist, but such is life.\r\n\r\nIt worried me a bit that I left without any proof that I had left my passport with them, like a receipt or such. What if they lost it and claim they never had it? \r\n\r\nAnyway, that's just my unnecessary worrying. My passport came back to me by courier three days after the interview, with the visa approved, ten years multiple entry. I'm going to the US!",

I wrote a short spoiler-free review over on Tumblr.\r\n\r\nTV-wise, I've been on a rewatch binge of 30 Rock that unfortunately started with season 4 due to Amazon Prime's weird way of presenting things. I've already blown past the series finale and wrapped around to the start and currently at season 2, so close to completion. The series is as great and insane as I remember. It's like a more outrageous version of ensemble comedies like Parks and Recreation, and though I am fonder of PNR, I can see why 30 Rock is the more award-winning show.\r\n\r\nBoth Star Trek Discovery and The Orville finished their second seasons this month. Discovery closed off their time loops neatly and sent the Discovery into an unknown future, meaning they get to start season 3 now no longer bound by Star Trek history and free to forge their own path. The season was ok, I enjoyed the classic Trek references and all the timey-wimey stuff. The Orville had a great season, with the introduction of a new enemy empire and possibly one of the best TV space battles of all time. They ended their season with a timey-wimey episode as well, looks like that's a trend for April.\r\n\r\nGame of Thrones final season started up in April of course, and its only halfway through.

But it felt super rewarding especially as a free-to-play player since the closed beta, always struggling for wildcards to build the decks. I had never tried going for Mythic beyond the first month, when I realized what a grind it was. This standard format was also pretty dynamic, which meant the best deck changed constantly, so it was hard to be successful by sticking to one deck, which meant a lot of WCs are needed to be able to shift with the meta. I spent my gold on packs basically as soon as I got them, to build up the collection and WCs quickly. As you can see, I'm fairly poor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the start of the month I was running an Esper fun deck, but that was only good enough to get me to gold. It eventually morphed into an Esper Planeswalker deck based on this tweet, which got me to Diamond. At that rank, I started having trouble with Gruul decks and 4c Dreadhorde decks. I switched to a slightly suboptimal Dreadhorde build (I didn't have enough WCs to get all the Tamiyos), but even then I was frustratingly oscillating between Diamond 3 and Diamond 1 for as long as a week. I finally decided to try the new Golgari LD deck that came out recently (I only built it today!), and it finally let me make that leap from D1 to Mythic. Only 30 hours before the season ends and a couple of days before I fly out for more than a month (curse you Arena for not letting me play on a Macbook!)\r\n\r\nHere's the list I took to Mythic:\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist title=\"Golgari LD\" }}\r\n1 Nissa, Who Shakes the World (WAR) 169\r\n5 Swamp (RIX) 194\r\n2 Vivien Reid (M19) 208\r\n1 Vraska, Golgari Queen (GRN) GR8\r\n7 Forest (RIX) 196\r\n2 Carnage Tyrant (XLN) 179\r\n4 Jadelight Ranger (RIX) 136\r\n4 Llanowar Elves (DAR) 168\r\n2 Casualties of War (WAR) 187\r\n1 Massacre Girl (WAR) 99\r\n4 Merfolk Branchwalker (XLN) 197\r\n2 Paradise Druid (WAR) 171\r\n2 Ravenous Chupacabra (RIX) 82\r\n4 Wildgrowth Walker (XLN) 216\r\n3 Assassin's Trophy (GRN) 152\r\n4 Field of Ruin (XLN) 254\r\n4 Overgrown Tomb (GRN) 253\r\n4 Woodland Cemetery (DAR) 248\r\n1 Vraska, Golgari Queen (GRN) 213\r\n2 Moment of Craving (RIX) 79\r\n1 Command the Dreadhorde (WAR) 82\r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist title=\"Sideboard\" }}\r\n1 Crucible of Worlds (M19) 229\r\n2 Cast Down (DAR) 81\r\n4 Duress (M19) 94\r\n2 Thrashing Brontodon (RIX) 148\r\n1 Ob Nixilis's Cruelty (WAR) 101\r\n2 The Elderspell (WAR) 89\r\n1 Command the Dreadhorde (WAR) 82\r\n2 Kraul Harpooner (GRN) 136\r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\n(Someday I'll fix my hugo templating to make these decklists prettier and include Arena export.)\r\n\r\nAs you can see, the list isn't optimal. I based it off SRXtheVG's 5-0 list at this link, but was missing quite a few rares, so I sort of played around with the list a bit. The Dreadhordes I just put in for fun, but I never got to play them.\r\n\r\nHere's some win-loss stats and meta snapshot, in case that interests you, care of MTG Arena Tool (which I only started using a couple of weeks ago, it was this data which told me to switch from Esper PWs!)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how accurate these game counts are, it felt like I did more matches with GolgariLD than listed here, but that may just have been frustration at the back and forth lol. And those win rates feel about right. I'm not sure if MTG Arena Tool picks up games from the logs if I forgot to run it during a particular Arena session, that happened a few times. But what is up with that Play/Draw% not adding up to 100%! \r\n\r\nAnyway, I won't be able to play Arena again until July, probably the meta will be completely different again by that time lol. For now, a welcome respite from the tyranny of the shuffler.\r\n\r\n{{% twitter 1133406151507243009 %}}",

The other available forms of government were typically not very useful, but Democracy massively increased your trade output, so most often I would build the Pyramids (a wonder which allowed switching to any government immediately and without penalty), and spend the rest of the game toggling between Democracy and Despotism (for when I wanted to go to war). \r\n\r\nThis made the game heavily slanted in favor of Western-style democracies, which was understandable for that time period. Around that era, the Soviet Union had just fallen, and the liberal democracy practiced by the United States, the one remaining superpower, became the shining example of a successful government that brought propserity to its citizens. I think that having grown up in this era and having been exposed to a lot of American culture (via TV and games and so forth) has led to my general bias in favor of liberal democracy and the values associated with it - freedom, equality, civil liberties, human rights, due process, checks and balances, separation of powers, and so on. (I cannot say the same is true for other people in my generation).\r\n\r\nThese days, the modern versions of Civilization have matured in terms of how they handle governments, recognizing that modern governments have different approaches that are not necessarily represented by \"democracy\". Civ 6 presents three choices for modern governments: Democracy, Communism, and Fascism; Civ 5 lets you choose between ideologies: Freedom, Order, or Autocracy. Perhaps this is a reflection of modern geopolitics, where not only is the United States teetering on the brink of authoritarianism, despite being the lone superpower, but those daring to challenge its hegemony are leaning more towards authoritarian governments as well. \r\n\r\nAside from America's traditional enemies like Russia and Iran, the starkest challenge comes from China, the juggernaut of Asia. Perhaps the ultimate counterexample to the idea that liberal democracy is the key to prosperity, China has been able to bring an economic boom to its citizens, leveraging the weight of a billion-person size market, all while retaining the trappings of power centralized in the state instead of the people. Censorship, propaganda, and adherence to the party are the norm, and those who dare speak out against the party are punished viciously. \r\n\r\nI was thinking about all of this after a recent discussion with some Duterte supporters over at r/PH on reddit. The arguments in favor of the Duterte administration seem to stem around seeing him as a leader that \"gets things done\" (in quotes because I'm not sure quantifiably that he is getting things done more than other presidents), without regard for the damage to liberal values such as human rights, due process, checks and balances, and so on. Indeed even during the 2016 elections you could see some internet commentary stating that the problem with the country was that we had \"too much freedom\", as if freedom were not an ideal to be aspired to. \r\n\r\nIn this light, the tendency of this admin to capitulate to China has an ideological angle as well, because China is the epitome of getting things done despite the cost to civil liberties, and of the state accumulating all power onto itself. It is disturbingly a trend not only in the Philippines, but even in a number of Western nations, where far-right parties with tendencies towards extreme nationalism and authoritarianism are gaining steam. \r\n\r\nI've always been of the opinion that the world mostly exists in a state of trying to find balance; most trends wax and wane, trying to find the optimal equilibrium in which to settle. I worry that perhaps liberal democracy's peak days have come and gone, and we are now on the brink on an era where authoritarianism gains ground. I had always hoped that our future was somehow leading to something like a Star Trek-like utopia, but there are plenty of other potential sci-fi future scenarios, not all of them pleasant. We can only hope that things get better before they get worse.\r\n\r\n(I'm not a political science expert or anything, so probably I'm not exactly using some of these terms accurately, feel free to educate me in the comments if you like.)",

Sometimes they follow me back for one reason or another, and it gives me a little bit of anxiety. The anxiety is because here is this person whose content I like, who followed me back probably because of an interaction we had, and she is expecting that my tweets will be more of the same kind of content.\r\n\r\nBut often it's not. I don't write about the same kind of thing all the time - one only needs to look at this blog to see that. I write on a variety of topics that interest me, from stuff I learn working as a software developer to movies to games to tv shows to things that are going on in my country to quotes I like and all other kinds of stuff. \r\n\r\nFor a while I considered that blogging might be more effective if I had a more focused blog, instead of this chaotic willy-nilly mess I've refused to give up on since 2002. I've tried starting topic-centered blogs before, about stuff like Magic the Gathering or comic books or software development using Django, but most of those efforts collpased and I just absorbed the contents back into this blog.\r\n\r\nI think having a focused blog depends really on your goals. Like, if your goal is to have a blog with a lot of followers and to grow your audience and to monetize through ads or newsletters or other methods, then focused, specific content is the way to go. But for me and this blog, as I like to remind myself, I'm writing largely for myself. This blog and this website are my presence on the internet, more than any social media account. Thus, it should reflect all my interests in totality, not just the ones that I can monetize or get me more work or whatever.\r\n\r\nI'm reminded of how sometimes on Twitter famous people like tech personalities will comment on something like politics and they'll get people who are disagreeable and go \"I follow you for your tech content, please keep your politics out of this\", which is ridiculous. Just because a person is primarily known for a certain thing doesn't mean their opinions and personalities can be limited to that thing only and for all time. People are multi-faceted, they have many views and many interests and they should be allowed to express themselves on whatever topic they like (within reasonable limits obviously no to hate speech thanks.)\r\n\r\nOn a barely related blog note: something I've been putting off for a while, I merged categories and tags on this blog. It just seems to make more sense. I probably broke some links somewhere though, I'll figure it out.\r\n",

Unmarked spoilers follow.\r\n\r\nThe eighth season was so notoriously bad, we got petitions asking for rewrites. Here's how I explained it to a friend after the notorious episode 5:\r\n\r\n It's not about characters being killed, it's about bad writing because they're cramming. The writers were determined to finish the show in 2 smaller seasons so they're skipping a lot of necessary character development and characters just do stupid things because the plot demands it. The most recent episode (spoilers follow, no apologies) has Dany do something really bad and out of character. It wouldn't have been so bad if they had spent maybe 5-6 episodes building up to it, but there's nothing, she just decided out of nowhere, fuck it, let's do this. The show was already very simplified compared to the books, which had a lot of plot threads and character arcs that never carried over to the show, which is understandable given the volume, and season 8 basically dumbs it down even more so they can hit their target number of episodes\r\n\r\nThe final episode aired today, and I was mostly whelmed. A big meh. It's always challenging to finish in a satisfying manner an epic story with many intersecting character arcs, especially something this popular. You are almost always not going to please everybody. Some endings made sense, some I could see that GRRM was probably planning for all along, some came out of nowhere (Arya the Explorer comes to mind). Like many things about season 8, so much of it feels crammed and unearned. The season might have been better received if they had stretched things out more. As it is, they had to do things like have Tyrion justify Dany's madness in a speech to Jon after the fact, instead of building up to it organically.\r\n\r\nExperiencing the series as a book reader was interesting, since we knew what was going to happen for basically the first five seasons. I'm sure I'm not the only book reader who was excited to see how TV viewers would react to things like the execution of Ned Stark and the Red Wedding. Once the series overtook the books, we then fell into this weird position of having the show spoil the books. Not that we wouldn't still read the books, but the show leaving out certain elements changes their importance in the books. For example, the absence of the Lady Stoneheart and Young Griff in the shows implied those plot threads were actually irrelevant to the show's ultimate ending. \r\n\r\nBut I think the poor writing in season 8 makes me look forward to the books more, if only to see if and how GRRM is able to deliver a better and more satisfying ending. I think the ending for the Starks is probably what he had in mind all along (or very close to it); in his initial outline for the entire series, it was always about the Starks. Whether he sticks to that plan or pivots after seeing the reactions to the show, we shall see. I read a great thread on Twitter describing GRRM as a \"pantser\" kind of writer, i.e. he writes by the seat of his pants, letting the characters and events drive the story forward instead of strictly following an outline. It makes for good narrative, but is probably also why he's taking forever to finish. And we hope he will finish! Maybe someday, when the books are done, we eventually get a better and more faithful remake series (cue the \"Game of Thrones: Brotherhood\" jokes).\r\n\r\nOverall though, I think history will look kindly on the entire series of Game of Thrones for what it did. It brought epic fantasy to the forefront of pop culture. People talked excitedly about every episode as it came out and speculated about what would happen. Even my dad got into it, even though I often had to explain some bits to him, and he didn't like watching the show without subtitles. They failed to stick the landing, so they don't belong in the same conversation as series like Breaking Bad, but there were a lot of epic moments and some very good television in those eight seasons, and the show ultimately deserves its places in the cultural zeitgeist. Because of this show, we are getting other epic fantasies as TV series moving forward. I'm most looking forward to Amazon's upcoming Wheel of Time series, hopefully they don't screw it up. (That one would take maybe two decades to finish!)\r\n\r\n",

When you have been reading (and speaking) English so much from an early age, you come to have an instinctive grasp of what is and what is not proper sentence construction. Some sentences just look right and some just look wrong. I'm not saying I have perfect mastery of the English language or anything. But I am for the most part capable of proper sentence construction. I like to think that being a programmer (or at least, a good programmer) correlates with a tendency towards good grammar as well, given how the syntax rules of programming languages are even stricter than the rules of English grammar.\r\n\r\nI used to be pretty anal about it too. I would correct most people given any opportunity, especially online in forums and social media and what not. These days I'm less inclined to do so, at least for strangers on the internet whose first language may or may not be English, unless the grammar is especially atrocious or the poster was asking for it in some way. I guess the advice in the following tweet mostly applies for me these days:\r\n\r\n{{ tweet 1125066018768945152 }}\r\n\r\nEven if don't speak up, I reserve the right to silently judge someone for poor grammar. Filipinos are notorious for judging others based on how good their English is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is mostly an elitist thing - English grammar isn't something the poorer or less educated citizens will be super familiar with (although most Filipinos will still understand rudimentary English of course... I think... ). Speaking good English is often seen as a sign of privilege. I imagine even foreigners make some judgments based on how good your English is; I imagine that my US Visa interview might have been a bit more difficult if I wasn't fluent. That being said, it may be a thing that's on the downturn, given the recent rise of anti-intellectualism locally (or is it really recent?)\r\n\r\nI will still often correct friends and family though. The people who know me well know that it doesn't signify any ill will or malice on my part, just a lingering obsessive desire for correct grammar. It's the same way a slightly misaligned painting hanging from the wall would bother other people (okay, that would bother me too).\r\n\r\nIn conclusion: I had to review this post a few times to make sure I made no grammatical errors, that would be embarrassing.\r\n",

I almost didn't want to write the usual election post, mostly because I was annoyed with and tired of the electorate and the politicians and the system and all that. But we shouldn't give in to despair. \r\n\r\nOften when choosing who to vote, it will be difficult to find candidates who align perfectly with your values. You make compromises to prioritize those issues you think are more important. You settle on lesser evils to try to stave off the worse ones. \r\n\r\nIt can be scary sometimes to make a judgment that \"this candidate is great\", because you can't really know a person right? And these candidates, you only see a sliver of their lives, what they project publicly, so it can be difficult to judge. But at least you should be openly rejecting those who are already projecting poor values: supporting murders, blind support for the administration, plunderers, criminals, etc.\r\n\r\nFor me, the most important issue facing the country right now is the need to provide a decent check and balance in the legislative branch, so for this reason, I will vote all of the Otso Diretso senatorial slate. Some of them aren't the best choices, but the administration candidates are far worse. Even if you are not inclined to support the opposition, I strongly suggest you consider Chel Diokno. He's the best candidate I've seen since the late Raul Roco. Gutoc, Alejano, and Aquino are the next best ones. Hilbay has had some flaky opinions, but he's smart without a doubt, and a bar topnotcher. Roxas had a poor stint sa executive branch, but he was ok sa legislative. Macalintal and Tanada are the ones I have the least info about, but again, opposition.\r\n\r\nI am considering leaving the remaining 4 slots open, will probably decide on election day. The pickings are slim. If only we had an option for downvotes instead, I could vote down the really bad choices like Marcos, Go, Revilla, dela Rosa.\r\n\r\nLocal elections: The Quezon City mayoral choices aren't very good. Belmonte has an air of incompetence. But her opponent Crisologo is as a friend described \"an evil Ilocano warlord stuck in the 70s\", so in the choice between incompetent and evil, we have no choice but to choose incompetence. (There is a third candidate, but I don't think he has a chance.)\r\n\r\nI think I will skip voting for the vice mayor and councilor slots. I have no info on them. \r\n\r\nFor the QC sixth district, I'm lucky that our district has a liberal party incumbent who has made some house votes I agree with, so for me it's still Kit Belmonte.\r\n\r\nParty list: Eh, IDK anymore. Maybe Akbayan or Magdalo.\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I don't have very strong opinions this time around, especially on the local level. I am not super optimistic about this election, as I suspect the electorate may very well disappoint me yet again. But still, duty is duty. And so we hope for the best while fearing the worst.",

Historically, those who have made it into the Senate did so mostly on name recognition. What does it matter if Diokno had the best resume of all the candidates, if many of the voters did not know who he was? How could he compete against someone who appeared on a hit primetime TV series right up until the start of the campaign period? \r\n\r\nSometimes I think, things were simpler before we were woke. For me, at least. When I was younger I didn't care much about politics. Oh of course like everybody, I got riled up about Estrada's impeachment trial and Gloria's election scandals, but back then I didn't have much awareness on who the senators were, what party they were aligned with, who were the senate president or the speaker of the house, etc. Not in-depth as I've done during the more recent elections. Even back then there was a general sense of how dirty the elections and our politicians were, but I didn't have much outrage in me then. Not yet at least. \r\n\r\nI think I started casting my vote in 2004, I certainly wasn't legal for the prior elections in '98 and I don't remember voting in the midterms in '01. At first I was like \"Okay, I cast my vote, that's my civic duty, yay\" and was done with it, but as time went by awareness started to grow. As the PH internet has matured, information about the candidates became more easily available, and with that came the eventual and repeated disappointment with who our electorate actually gave the victories to. \r\n\r\nCut to today, and the vicious cycle repeats. Disheartening results that make no rational sense whatsoever. As if elections were ever decided rationally. And so it goes.\r\n\r\nMany are being down on those who express an intention to migrate because of their disappointment. I can't blame those who feel this way. It would be better to stay and fight the good fight of course, but it's never that easy. People can get tired of politics, and I know that's what certain parties would want - to beat us into submission by bludgeoning us with these terrible politicians and their dirty ways - but let people be tired and let people express their frustrations, it's healthier that way.\r\n\r\nSometimes I'm envious of those who chose to stay \"unwoke\", that is, unconcerned with modern-day political issues, and just stick to living their daily lives. Like I said, times were simpler then. You only worried about your own problems. You shook your fist at the taxman and the shitty government service but at the end of the day did nothing about it. It's selfish, but it can be understandable. Life is not always easy, and not all are accorded the privilege of worrying about things greater than themselves. All the more reason for us who have that privilege to do so.\r\n\r\nI am tempted to just step back from it all, back to those simpler times. I've spent too much energy worrying about this country, let others take over now. I won't be personally affected too much - I'm not likely to be killed in a drug bust, I'm not one of the poor that his cronies can bully around, I don't lose anything if they let China take our islands, I can survive any economic fallout (probably), I have enough sources of real information even if they choke the press, I have the option of migrating if things get too bad, etc. There is a part of me that is just like \"bahala na kayo diyan, just let me watch my movies and play my video games in peace!\" But who am I kidding? The odds that I can stay out of it for long are low, but perhaps a short respite is in order.\r\n\r\nThings were simpler before we were woke. Unfortunately, that's a genie we can't put back in the bottle. Being woke is exhausting. Rest, regroup, recover, and hopefully have the energy to come back and fight again.\r\n\r\nThese rants were brought to you by the letters disappointment and frustration.",

This is not entirely inaccurate, though I prefer not to tinker with real world stuff because of my poor dexterity. My tinkering is usually limited to software and tech devices. I'm always willing to try different things to figure out how to get software to work. I guess this contributes to my aptitude for software development.\r\n\r\nI was thinking about this because there's some contrast when I'm working with non-technical people who easily get frustrated with why things don't work. They often won't even try simple things like restarting something or pushing buttons to see what happens.

While that's a concern, modern tech is a lot more resilient and uh, well, shall we say \"idiot proof\" than back in the old days, but I guess that's difficult to communicate to someone who doesn't have a technical background.\r\n\r\nReally though, with the modern internet giving video tutorials for most anything, there is little reason to not be a tinkerer these days, but I guess if you didn't grow up with that mentality it's difficult to adjust especially when you're older. For younger people who grew up on the internet just trying to push whatever buttons until you figure out what you want seems to come naturally with the usage of tablets and smartphones and such. My nieces certainly handle modern technology a lot better than their grandparents do.\r\n\r\nThe world needs more tinkerers and technical people anyway, and maybe a tad less of people like salesmen, marketers and propagandists.",

Especially given that I've had formal lessons in rhetoric and logic.\r\n \r\n Do not believe that logical fallacies are fallacies. Or rather--understand that they are logical fallacies, but that the world does not run on logic and so any classroom lessons on what arguments are fallacious have no relevance.\r\n \r\n The only relevant matter is if people react positively to what you say.\r\n \r\n The people who respond to facts ARE ALREADY ANTI-DUTS. So forget about convincing more voters with facts. The numbers of the executed don't matter to them. Duterte's bank accounts that have been proven to exist don't matter to them. The Duts' family businesses that have not been registered with the SEC or which have irregularities in their filings don't matter to them.\r\n \r\n That shit just don't fly for them.\r\n \r\n Accept it.\r\n \r\n Rely on appeals to emotion, on ad hominem attacks, on oversimplified memes, on dramatic pictures, short posts with punchy lines that are light on numbers. Get people to identify with you first, get them to agree with you on things that are completely nonpolitical so that they start to see that you aren't so different from them.\r\n \r\n Resort to all the muck that works in the real world.\r\n \r\n If people have to be tricked into believing the truth... that's better than them continuing to be tricked into believing lies.\r\n \r\n Pictures of executed people are more effective than the names of the murdered. Pictures of Chinese businesses are more effective than long talks about interest rates. If you've worked in graphic design or in marketing or the ad business, YOU ALREADY KNOW what works.\r\n\r\nI'm afflicted by a certain form of foolish idealism that makes me want to believe that decisions should be made based on things like facts, logic, and reason. I want to believe that we can take the high road, and not have to resort to the same tactics I find distasteful. I realize that often this isn't how the world works, and yes ever since the last elections, I've found myself more and more disillusioned and disenchanted about how the Filipino electorate makes their decisions. I don't what happens with the elections in two weeks - I don't even know how I'm going to be voting - but my expectaions are not high. Regardless of what happens or what compromises we end up making or supporting or whatever imperfect politicians we end up voting for or electing, I think we need to make sure not to lose sight of the ideals we hold and of what we believe the ideal world needs to be, and how we need to get there. Otherwise, what are we even fighting for?",

With War of the Spark now out and the metagame not yet established, I thought I'd be foolish and waste my wildcards on some brewing. As a reminder, I'm still an F2P player on Arena, so wildcards are precious and few lol. I did have some 50k in gold and a few gems saved up when War of the Spark hit, so i have already played a few sealeds (only 1 got to 7 wins) and opened quite a few packs. One of the nice constructed decks I've seen is that Grixis control shell with Nicol Bolas Dragon God, but since the previous, I've always wanted to finish off opponents by exiling things with Ashiok, Dream Render and then ultimating Kaya, Orzhov Usurper. Luckily I had most of the cards needed for an Esper control shell, just needed to burn some rare wildcards to flesh out the manabase and a couple of mythics here and there.\r\n\r\nHere's my first totally unoptimized draft:\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist title=\"Esper Funsies\" }}\r\n3 Isolated Chapel (DAR) 241\r\n4 Hallowed Fountain (RNA) 251\r\n4 Godless Shrine (RNA) 248\r\n2 Glacial Fortress (XLN) 255\r\n4 Drowned Catacomb (XLN) 253\r\n4 Watery Grave (GRN) 259\r\n3 Oath of Kaya (WAR) 209\r\n2 Swamp (RIX) 194\r\n1 Plains (RIX) 192\r\n4 Kaya's Wrath (RNA) 187\r\n4 Kaya, Orzhov Usurper (RNA) 186\r\n4 Ashiok, Dream Render (WAR) 228\r\n3 Duress (M19) 94\r\n4 Thought Erasure (GRN) 206\r\n3 Sinister Sabotage (GRN) 54\r\n2 Chemister's Insight (GRN) 32\r\n2 Mortify (RNA) 192\r\n4 Thief of Sanity (GRN) 205\r\n2 Liliana, Dreadhorde General (WAR) 97\r\n1 Teferi, Hero of Dominaria (DAR) GR6\r\n\r\n{{ /cardlist }}\r\n\r\nNo sideboard, since I'm only testing in BO1 for now. (For some reason Arena gives me a warning that Teferi requires a sideboard!) The control matchups seem manageable, depending on draws. Fast decks (i.e. RDW) are a bit more challenging, might need some cheaper spot removal like Moment of Craving. I did manage to ultimate Kaya for 20+ damage a couple of times already, so that's fun. I don't have that much time for testing though, so I imagine this is a list that I will be optimizing over time. Any suggestions are welcome.",

I've written about that separately here.\r\n\r\nMost of the US TV series also ended their runs in May. Arrowverse show seasons were littered with poor writing as usual. I rank the seasons in this order: \r\n\r\nbest is Legends of Tomorrow season 4. The reason Legends is the best is that they're not afraid to be outrageous. My favorite moment was from before the midseason break, Puppets of Tomorrow!\r\nsecond best is Supergirl season 4. I don't like that Supergirl always felt very preachy about modern-day issues like feminism and diversity and immigration, and this season amped that up a lot, but I still enjoyed it because (a) Lex Luthor was great; and (b) they adapted a couple of my favorite DC Superman storylines, namely Manchester Black and the Elite and Red Son (Red Daughter in this case).\r\nthird best is Flash season 5. Cicada was a terrible villain and the rules of when and how the dagger works were just screwy, but I'm glad Eobard gets to come back in the ending (though I still don't know why he has Wells' face)\r\nlast is Arrow season 7, just poor all-around writing, including an episode where Roy Harper flat out murders two innocents and everyone else on Team Arrow is like \"Huh, okay, we'll cover this up so the police don't find out\", and a poorly explained road to Star City's future. The season finale tellss us that Oliver dies during the upcoming Crisis of Infinite Earths. Arrow had a good run, but a few of the seasons were really week. It didn't get as many seasons as Smallville did, but it has a legacy of its own (and arguably Smallville lasted a couple of seasons too long as well). More on this when Arrow's abbreviated eighth and final season finishes later this year.\r\n\r\nDespite all my complaints, I'm still looking forward to this year's Crisis crossover!\r\n\r\nSpeaking of DC TV series, Gotham also ended its 5-season run, and although the show diverges significantly from the traditional Batman mythos, I still liked it. It wasn't spectacular or anything, but there were some nice portrayals of many Batman characters and events. We never get to see Bruce don the cape and cowl, although it is heavily foreshadowed in the last episode.\r\n\r\nThe Big Bang Theory also had its series finale, and I liked it. Overall as a series it had its flaws, and at many times promoted smart-shaming and nerd stereotypes, but its a sitcom, so I don't take it too seriously. I think the ending of Sheldon getting his nobel prize (with Amy) and finally acknowledging how difficult he has been as a friend is an appropriate ending for the series.\r\n\r\nIn my attempt to watch/read more manga/anime again, I started watching Boku no Hero Academia on Netflix a few months ago, but only got two episodes in. This month I finally binged the rest of the anime and for good measure caught up with the manga as well. This series feels like some cross of One Punch Man (for the superpowers and the modern society) and Naruto (for the kids being supervised by adults), except I'd say the depth of the lore so far is not that much, more OPM than Naruto. Still a fairly enjoyable read/watch, since I usually enjoy shonen manga/anime, and it got me thinking that Marvel should make a shonen version of an X-Men comic someday.\r\n\r\nNot much movies-wise this month, though I did do a rewatch of Winter Soldier the other day, mostly because I had watched some videos ranking the MCU movies now that Endgame is done. Winter Soldier was always in my #1 slot, and the rewatch basically affirmed that. I had only meant to watch a little bit before going off to do something else, but the pacing of the movie was so great I just ended up watching it to the end. I think the themes of freedom vs security also really resonate with the liberal in me. \r\n\r\nThat's it for this month! Next month I'll be travelling, so who knows what I'll be able to watch! I'll have access to US Netflix!",

I devoured Eye of the World much more quickly than I expected, finishing the book in less than 3 days. It helps that I had already read it before of course, but I think there's also a part of me that enjoys escaping into this fantasy world when the real world outlook seems dire. \r\n\r\nAnyway, the book shows a lot of Tolkien-esque plot influence, especially near the start: Some kids from a backwater village are visited by a magic user and after some troubles are forced on the run from black riders? Sounds familiar. Not only that, but you can even map the characters somewhat:\r\n\r\nEmond Field kids - Hobbits\r\nMoiraine - Gandalf\r\nLan - Aragorn\r\nThom - Okay, LoTR didn't have a bard, but he does take the role of sacrificing himself while the kids run\r\n\r\nThere's even a location called the Mountains of Dhoom, which is a riduclous name!\r\n\r\nBut that's fine. I remember back when I read this series the first time I didn't have much patience for Jordan's prose where he describes everything in so many words including the food being eaten, the clothes worn, the crowds, the buildings and so on; I was always hungry for the plot so I tended to skim a lot of the background noise. This time I made more of an effort to appreciate the prose and the settings, since I already knew most of the plot. It is not as boring as I feared it would be, and perhaps my imagination is more enriched because of it. The characters certainly look a bit different in my head now than they did before.\r\n\r\nStill, the book does take its time. After Shadar Logoth, the party gets split up and it takes them forever to be reunited. It isn't until 85% through the book that everyone gets back together and Moiraine concludes that they have to go visit the titular Eye of the World. \r\n\r\nThe Nynaeve and Lan relationship wasn't built up very well either I think. It seems they just were suddenly affectionate near the end, after barely anything more than longing looks and barely any conversations for most of the book. Also, I'm looking forward to the WoT TV series if only to learn how to properly pronounce \"Nynaeve\".\r\n\r\nThe book ends with a victory for the good guys. Not THE victory, as some of them think, but it is a victory. But it is also a strange place, as Rand discovers what he can do and decides to leave the group for a while. The next book takes them to Ilian for the Great Hunt I believe, and I seem to recall that it may be a long time before the Emond Fielders are together in the same place again. Onwards!\r\n\r\n",

I settled on a re-read of Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series, a pretty good time for it since by next year we may have a TV series from Amazon (hopefully better than Game of Thrones). Side note: Wheel of Time is also why I'm not optimistic that GRRM can finish ASoIaF in just two more books - Jordan took forever and died before he could finish WoT and even Sanderson who took over needed an additional three books to finish the saga.\r\n\r\nIt's been a while since I read any of the books - I bought and read the final book A Memory of Light when it came out, so that was around 2013. That means I followed the series for around two decades - I remember borrowing Eye of the World from a friend maybe around late high school/early college (circa mid 90s) and quickly going through the books until I was caught up. Wheel of Time was my first real epic fantasy series - I only read Tolkien later on and before that most of my fantasy exposure was limited to TV and movies. I enjoyed the first half of the 14-book series, then got annoyed by the pacing in the second half, and was relieved when Sanderson managed to satisfactorily land the plane with Memory of Light. My annoyance with the later books may have been due to the fact that I had to wait for each one in turn to be released - it will be interesting to see how the series holds up for me now that I can read all the books in succession. I also like to think I've matured as a reader since then and will be able to appreciate the books differently.\r\n\r\nI'm also well behind my book reading target for this year, so doing a re-read of a long series gives me a good bump. Also, since the books have been out forever, I'm not going to bother to mark spoilers when I'm discussing them.\r\n\r\nI am however starting with a book I haven't read yet - New Spring is a prequel novel that I never bothered to read before. The story takes place 20 years before Eye of the World, so it's a good starting point. \r\n\r\nThe story follows the PoV of two characters introduced in Eye of the World - Moiraine Damodred, starting out as an Accepted with future Amyrlin Siuan Sanche at the White Tower in Tar Valon, and Lan Mandragoran, fresh off the tail end of the Aiel War and how their paths eventually intersect. Given the two main characters future, we can anticipate that the novel will end with them forming the Warder bond. The book is short - about half as long as Eye of the World - but as is typical of Robert Jordan, it takes a long time to get there, as most of the first half of the book centers around Moiraine and Siuan navigating the intrigues of the White Tower as the search for The Dragon Reborn begins. \r\n\r\nThe pace picks up a bit once Moiraine manages to leave the tower and crosses path with Lan and they realize the existence of the Black Ajah searching for the Dragon Reborn. Yes, reading this book before the rest means you are already aware the Black Ajah exists. \r\n\r\nGiven how at the start of this book Lan is openly disdainful of getting caught in Aes Sedai problems and how tight Moiraine and Lan are by the time of Eye of the World, I assumed there would be some big life-changing event near the end of the book that would cause him to change his mind and allow the Warder bond, but I was a bit whelmed by how it happened. One would think losing his oldest bondsman to the Black Ajah would Lan more wary of Aes Sedai, but all it took was a quick reminder from Moiraine about the stakes and he easily acquiesed to the bond. Oh well.\r\n\r\nI finished the book in 3 days (as I said, quite short), but the other books in the series are at least twice as long, and there are 14 more books to go, so I think there should be plently leftover by the time the trip rolls around.",

I've been meaning to write more regularly about it, but one thing I had forgotten was how exhausting it would be to be a tourist, walking everywhere all of the time. Here's how many steps my Fitbit recorded during that first week:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI finished this week with a bit more than 105k steps, which I'm pretty sure is a lifetime record (though I dont have the data anymore from the Europe trip in 2015 - I suspect that it's comparable in scale.) Compunding the tiredness was that I wasn't getting much sleep, especially during that first day when we spent more than 13 hours on a plane:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 0 hours there is probably a bit inaccurate. I always find it difficult to sleep on planes, so long hauls are difficult, but I'm sure I managed to get a few short bursts of sleep here and there. I suspect the Fitbit is not very well suited to measuring that sort of sleep especially when seated upright in an airplane seat.\r\n\r\nSo, that is my excuse for not being able to write much. It's likely that this first week will have been the most exhausting part of the trip, this is where we scheduled the California theme parks after all (more on that in the next post). It is of course a net positive that I am walking so much, since this is pretty much the only exercise I get these days. I've been thinking about whether I would be able to maintain this level of walking (or even half as much!) when I get back home after the trip, as I have been slacking off on the walking the past few months. Hopefully I can find a way.",

I think for the most part they are overpriced and not worth the time, effort or money. And I'd probably never go to one by myself or without one of my nieces/nephews. I understand the impetus of bringing kids to a theme park of course, they really enjoy it. Prior to this trip, I've only ever been to a theme park once, and that was in Unversal Studios Singapore with my brothers back in 2015.\r\n\r\nThis time we went to Disneyland in Anaheim and Universal Studios Hollywood. The kids with us were the nieces, 9yo and 3yo. \r\n\r\nObviously, the kids loved Disneyland. We got a 3 day pass and spent the first day in Disneyland Park and the next 2 days in California Adventure. The kids had been to the Asian Disneylands before, so there was more new stuff for them in the California Adventure side. \r\n\r\nVisiting Disneyland reminded me of what a cultural tour de force Disney is in general. Kids from all the over the world come visit Disneyland and they instantly recognize and respond to all of these characters. When the nieces spot one of the mascots walking around they just shout out in glee and run up and wave to them. Yes, even the older niece. It's not just the major Disney characters like Mickey and Minnie and Donald either. Kids respond well even to the minor characters or the obscure ones from random Disney channel shows. Disneyland really is for kids. (On a less Disney-branded note, I was also amused by how kids everywhere react the same way to bubbles being blown their way.)\r\n\r\nSome highlights of the 3 days at Disneyland:\r\n\r\na short play re-telling Tangled. Well, I only note this because I haven't watched Tangled before and only now found out its story\r\nthe Disneyland parade that happen at the main central area. It's pretty long, and the music can get repetitive and earwormy, but I liked how they highlighted a bunch of their properties like Aladdin, Little Mermaid, etc., though there were some weird choices there too\r\nOn the California Adventure side, the best thing was the live action Frozen play at the Hyperion theatre. It's a one hour re-telling of the movie (with a few liberties taken), with all the songs and everything. The performances were great, and the entire show in general was a masterful use of the stage, props, lighting, projectors, holograms, etc. It's not the sort of show they could stage at just any theatre either. Having two nieces I have of course seen the movie a few dozen times so one would think I'd be tired of it by now, but I was very entertained.\r\nthere was also this nice Toy Story-themed game/ride where you used a virtual gun to shoot at targets like in a carnival, it was fun. If you only had time for one ride in California Adventure, this is the one I'd recommend\r\n\r\nWe did quite a number of other simpler rides (just the ones where you're sitting and there's a show going on around you), and picture taking with various characters. I don't have many pictures handy to show here, but here's me with Captain America:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe didn't do anything like roller coasters or that new Guardians of the Galaxy which goes up and down and stuff. The kids don't like it, and I'm not sure I could either, tbh. There was also a lot of wandering around the mechandise shops of course, I'm sure they make a lot of money off all the toys. I ended up buying something my brother requested for my nephew, only to find it available again at another place for a cheaper price. Lol, I should learn never to buy stuff at theme parks.\r\n\r\nAfter Anaheim, we took a short train over to LA, and we went to Universal Studios Hollywood. This theme park is not as kid-focused as Disneyland was, so the 3yo didn't have as much of a good time, though she did enjoy seeing characters like the Simpsons, Harry Potter, and so on. The rides are also for bigger kids mostly - they're the sort of rides that are full of high-speed movement, jumping and jerking around, some falling and so on. I only did the Transformers ride (which was the same as the one in Singapore) and the Minions ride, I already got a bit dizzy just from those two. I suspect the Harry Potter one was more intense (just based on the warnings), but there was like an 80 minute wait for that so we didn't bother. I did enjoy walking around the Simpsons area and seeing all the references and the characters.\r\n\r\nWe also did the Studio Tour, which is really for movie geeks than anyone else, so again the kids didn't enjoy it as much. The first part was a bit boring, just showing us the exteriors of the sound stages (basically just looking at warehouses). Things got a bit more interesting when they showed us some exterior locations, and there were a few parts where we got to experience a bit of a show . The \"shows\" were basically projected into a tunnel while our trams moved around. One was a Skull Island themed scene where King Kong was fighting a t-rex or such, and another was Fast and Furious themed which involved a high speed chase and jumping off bridges and such. There was also a special effects part where we were in a subway tunnel when an earthquake strikes, and there's fire and suddenly the tunnel is flooded. I think the studio tour was the highlight for me.\r\n\r\nWe also attended the special effects show, a 30-minute show demoing various special effects. Again, the 3yo didn't like it so much, especially in the parts where they pretended to saw off a volunteer's hand or send the volunteer flying through space. It was fun for me though, and a bit informative as well.\r\n\r\nWe had also been planning to go to Legoland near San Diego, but it turns out the trip would've cost a bit more than we'd like, and online reviews said we might be disappointed especially coming from Disneyland, so we ended up not going. Instead we wandered around Hollywood boulevard and went to a few exhibits there - namely Ripley's Believe it or Not, Guinness Book of World Records, and the Hollywood Wax Museum. The Guinness one was the best of the three, as there were a bunch of interactive games and exhibits that we enjoyed. The 3yo didn't like being in the Ripley's or the Wax Museum as she was a bit scared of some of the exhibits. Ripley's had some creepy and weird stuff, including a couple that made the 9yo scream and run in surprise. I did like some of the displays, like the model of Minas Tirith made entirely of matchsticks, or the Darth Vader made out of car parts. The Wax Museum was nice, but didn't have much and was over too quickly.\r\n\r\nOverall, the theme park experience was fun. Still not changing my view that they are overpriced, and since I don't have kids, I may never go to a Disneyland ever again, but it's probably good that I got to experience it at least once so I know what I'm talking about!",

But then again we did spend our three days there just going to Disneyland, so what can you do?\r\n\r\nIn LA we stayed in the Koreatown district, so everything felt weirdly Asian. Not Asian like living in Asia, but like Chinatown in any other city I guess? The city felt a bit dirty, I'm told the metro elevators smelled bad, and there was grafitti everywhere and a high incidence of homeless people. One time we took an elevator to get to the Metro and there was a homeless person smoking in the elevator. When he saw the kids, he promptly killed the cigarette and muttered apologetically \"I don't smoke near kids.\" Hollywood was all ritz and glitter and tourist traps though.\r\n\r\nWe only spent a couple of nights and one full day in Las Vegas, but the heat was insufferable. And considering I'm from Manila, that's saying something. It was hot too in LA and Anaheim, but LV had a weird sort of desert heat that seemed to linger on your skin. On our full day, we opted to spend most of daylight just hanging out in the hotel room, with the occasional outside forays for food. We spent the night on a short walking tour among the nearby hotels and the free shows like the Atlantis show at the forum or the fountain at Bellagio. Our LV-native cousin was our guide, and we (or they at least) took a lot of pictures.\r\n\r\nWe spent a few days in Houston, enough to bring the kids to attractions like the Space Center, Kemah Boardwalk, the Aquarium, and the Natural Science Museum. The kids enjoyed some of the rides; I tried one of the tamer ones at the Boardwalk, but still came away dizzy. I'm too old for these things. Science geek that I am, I most enjoyed the Space Center and the Natural Science Museum.\r\n\r\nHouston felt like a large expanse where everything was so far away from each other. We were lucky to be visiting a cousin who could drive us around; it would have been impossible to live here without a car. There's always so much room everywhere, even downtown Houston never felt congested or anything remotely like Metro Manila.\r\n\r\nThe trip is only halfway done, but I think the most exhausting days should be behind me.

        "content": "---\r\nauthor: roy\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2019-07-16 05:56:56\r\ntags:\r\nsoftware development\r\ntitle: '10X Programmers'\r\ntype: post\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe topic of the mythical \"10x programmer\" has been the topic of discussion recently on tech twitter, due to a thread listing out the supposed signs of being such a mythical beast.\r\n\r\n{{% twitter 1149302828420067328 %}}\r\n\r\nThe thread received a lot of negative responses, mainly because several of these items can be considered red flags indicating someone who doesn't play well with others - hates meetings, prefer irregular hours, poor mentoring ability, disdain for documentation, find process miserable, works alone to produce great code, etc. These attributes remind me of Steve McConnel's description of programming heroics in Professional Software Development:\r\n\r\n Combine a shortage of skilled workers with the common tendency to set overly optimistic schedules, and the stage is set for the programming hero. Programming heroes take on challenging assignments and write mountains of code. They work vast amounts of overtime. They become indispensable to their projects. Success, it seems, rests squarely on their shoulders.\r\n \r\n Project managers both love and fear hero programmers because they are smart, temperamental, and sometimes a little self-righteous, and because the managers don't see any way to complete the project without them. In a tight labor market, replacing them isn't an option.\r\n \r\n Unfortunately, the reality is that for every programming hero who is capable of monumental coding achievements, there are other pathological programming disasters who just don't know how to work well with others. They hoard design information and source code. They refuse to participate in technical reviews. They refuse to follow standards established by the team. The sum total of their actions is to prevent other team members from making potentially valuable contributions. A significant number of programming heroes don't turn out to be heroes at all; they turn out to be prima donna programming ball hogs.\r\n\r\nDespite the negative feedback, I found myself relating to the list in the thread above because most if not all of these items could have been used to describe myself at some point or another in my career. Especially in my earlier years, I had a profound dislike for meetings and documentation and process. I think this sort of attitude stems from the transition from being a solo developer (which you largely are in school) who enjoys the act of coding to being part of a team tasked to deliver the software. The first-time team member may find it difficult to appreciate having to do all these non-coding things (meetings, mentoring, documentation) because he doesn't yet have an appreciation of how they can make things smoother for the entire team. \r\n\r\nNot all of the items in the list are bad habits. Luckily, I think I grew out of most of the bad ones as my career went on and I became part of different teams and filled different roles. Not all of these are bad habits though. Going through the list:\r\n\r\n - 10x engineers hate meetings. They think it is a waste of time and obvious things are being discussed. They attend meetings because the manager has called for a \"Staff meeting\" to discuss the features and status.\r\n\r\nI'm still wary of too many unnecessary meetings, but I also understand how getting people away from their IDEs and together for a discussion can be necessary to bring a project back on track. \r\n\r\n - Timings in the office for 10x engineers is highly irregular. They tend to work when very few folks are around. If there is a crowd or all-hands meeting, they are not visible. Most of them are late-night coders and come late to the office.\r\n\r\nI think locally, people tend to come in later during the day instead of earlier, due to Metro Manila traffic. I knew that if I wanted some focused time, I could come in early and not much people would bother me. I think this is generally an ok practice, as long as you're still available during core hours when your team needs you.\r\n\r\n - 10x engineers laptop screen background color is typically black (they always change defaults). Their keyboard keys such as i, f, x are usually worn out than of a, s, and e (email senders).\r\n\r\nThis one is just straight-up cargo-cult nonsense. Different people have different preferences. (Okay, I do prefer dark background IDEs). \r\n\r\n - 10x engineers know every line of the code that has gone into production. If a QA or support folks alert an issue, they know precisely where the fault (or bug) is and can fix the same in hours vs days\r\n\r\nI have been in this kind of situation, although I guess it's a bit of an exaggeration. Typically if you're working in a team with a nontrivial codebase and you \"know everything\", some of your knowledge may be shallow, and some other devs who spent more time with each module may have more in-depth knowledge of how a particular module works. Having one guy with good oversight into the codebase can be handy for the team - for the reason cited above, they may easily be identify the cause of an issue, but the team should make sure he's not the only guy familiar with everything. Some redundancy is needed so that you aren't always dependent on the same person everytime. It's also bad for you as the developer who knows everything about the codebase, as it can be very hard to go on vacation, you'll have a tendency to get calls such as \"Hey, just a really quick question, do you know where is the code that does XYZ?\"\r\n\r\n - Most of the 10x engineers are full-stack engineers. For them code is code, they don't care whether it is front-end, back-end, API, database, serverless, etc. I have rarely seen them doing UI work.\r\n\r\nThis is still true for me. And just the other day during a call I had to give a disclaimer that my UI work isn't the best lol. I don't think this is indicative of disdain for specialists, there should be room in a team for both generalists and specialists.\r\n\r\n - 10x engineers can convert \"thought\" into \"code\" in their mind and write it in an iterative fashion. Given a product feature, they can write that entire feature in one or two sittings of 4 to 6 hours with a caffeinated drink without distraction.\r\n\r\nI mean, this is just describing a developer who's in the zone. It's true that developers who can get into the zone on a regular basis are likely to be much more productive, that's a tautology.\r\n\r\n - 10x engineers rarely look at help documentation of classes or methods. They know it in memory and can recall from memory. They write code at the same ease as writing English. No breaks, no pauce, just type.\r\n\r\nThis one is a bit of BS, especially in modern software development where we have the meme of developers coding by stackoverflow. It might have been true in the older days when there weren't a billion and one APIs and frameworks to know and learn.\r\n\r\n - 10x engineers are always learning new frameworks, languages ahead of everyone in the company. They are not afraid of anything new. If there is something new (e.g. blockchain) they gobble up, setup, experiment before anyone is getting started.\r\n\r\nThis one is still true for me as of now. I still enjoy exploring new frameworks, languages and technologies, though I don't always have the time for it. I think this is a good trait for a developer to have, but at the same time it may be dangerous to expect or require this of developers when putting together a team. Not everyone enjoys coding, and developers shouldn't be penalized for not wanting to do software stuff outside of work hours.\r\n\r\n - 10x engineers are poor mentors as they can't teach others on what to do OR parcel the work. They always think \"It takes too long to teach or discuss with others, I would rather do it myself.\" They are also poor interviewers.\r\n\r\nI'm sure I have uttered some variation of that quote more than once in my career. The tendency to try to carry all the load yourself is not only a disservice to yourself, it's a disservice to your team as you're not helping them grow. I will admit my mentoring skills in the early years wasn't very good - I'm the type of mentor who tends to throw you into the deep end so you can quickly learn to swim. This is because that's my personal learning style as well, I learn more from trying stuff than from a lecture or a book. I understand that not everyone learns the same way, so I do actively try to spot opportunities for me to learn to explain things better (I like to think writing in a blog helps!) and for better mentoring. And I think my interviewing skills have improved a bit through the years as well.\r\n\r\n - 10x engineers don't hack things. They write quality code and know exactly how the code has to evolve, and have a mental model of overall code structure. They write at most one design document, and the rest is in the code.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the most productive engineers not hacking things can only come from an idealist who hasn't experienced schedule pressure. While of course quality code is an ideal, the best engineers know when it is necessary to make tradeoffs and workarounds to meet requirements and schedules. And they will write as many documents as needed to make sure things can be understood. \r\n\r\n - 10x engineers rarely job hunt or move out of the company. They move out because you make their life miserable with the process, meetings, training, and other non-value-added activities. If you come across them, hold on to them. Celebrate them.\r\n\r\nThis was true for me for the longest time, I stayed with my first company for 15 years before deciding to move on. I would suspect this tends to be true for the type of engineer I described who enjoys the coding part and not so much the dealing with people part of the job. Moving companies means a lot more noncoding work: meeting new people, learning new processes and procedures, more meetings and trainings and interviews and what not. Laziness is probably also a factor. \r\n\r\nThe items listed here remind me of the type of programmer stereotype where one programmer goes into his office, tells nobody not to bother him, then comes out after three days having written all the code and solved all the company's problems. It's a ridiculous, dangerous stereotype that doesn't mesh well with how modern software development teams work. \r\n\r\nI'm not claiming that 10x engineers don't exist, I'm sure they do, and I know from experience many of the above stereotypes can be true. But stereotypes are just that - stereotypes. Every programmer has had a different path and there can be superproductive programmers who also know how to well work with teams and can be great mentors and write great documentation.\r\n\r\nI'm also not necessarily claiming to be a 10x programmer even though I claim to relate to the items here (false humility?). I would appreciate being paid a 10x salary though. :D\r\n\r\nA second thread on 10x programmers I like, from Alan Cooper:\r\n\r\n{{% twitter 1150215587978596353 %}}",

I had the choices of Washington DC on the 14th-16th (Limited), Seattle on 20th-23rd (Limited), or Dallas on 28th-30th (Modern). After some wrangling with the family's schedule, Seattle was the one most convenient to go to, and Limited meant I didn't have to try and put together a decent deck. (IDK how GP Dallas is going to go next weekend, given the problem in Modern that is Hogaak, so I guess I'm lucky I didn't choose Dallas). Seattle was split over four days because instead of the regular day 1 and 2 for the main event, they had day 1A and 1B, and you could join either event or both to qualify for day 2. I chose to register for Saturday, Day 1A.\r\n\r\nIt turns out the limited format for GP Seattle was Modern Horizons, a set which was released on the weekend the US trip started. This meant I had no chance for any sort of practice beforehand, since the laptop I had was a Mac, which could not run MTGO. (Had the format been War of the Spark limited, I could have simply practiced at home during the trip).\r\n\r\nSo my first taste of Modern Horizons limited was the first Last-Chance Trial on Thursday. Before that all I had was reading and research and theorycrafting. I knew from all of that MH1 limited was a tough format with a lot of synergies to consider. With perhaps a bit too much arrogance, I assumed my basic limited skills and prep work could push me through. \r\n\r\nHere's the sealed pool I got for the LCT:\r\n\r\n{{ cardlist title=\"GP Seattle 2019 Last Chance Trial Sealed Pool\" }}\r\n\r\n[White]\r\n1 Answered Prayers\r\n1 Ephemerate\r\n1 Giver of Runes\r\n1 Irregular Cohort\r\n1 Knight of Old Benalia\r\n1 Lancer Sliver\r\n1 Martyr's Soul\r\n1 Recruit the Worthy\r\n1 Shelter\r\n1 Soul-Strike Technique\r\n1 Trustworthy Scout\r\n1 Wall of One Thousand Cuts\r\n1 Wing Shards\r\n[/White]\r\n\r\n[Blue]\r\n1 Bazaar Trademage\r\n1 Chillerpillar\r\n1 Cunning Evasion\r\n1 Eyekite\r\n1 Faerie Seer\r\n1 Iceberg Cancrix\r\n1 Oneirophage\r\n1 Phantom Ninja\r\n1 Pondering Mage\r\n1 Prohibit\r\n1 Spell Snuff\r\n1 String of Disappearances\r\n1 Windcaller Aven\r\n1 Winter's Rest\r\n[/Blue]\r\n\r\n[Black]\r\n1 Azra Smokeshaper\r\n1 Changeling Outcast\r\n1 Feaster of Fools\r\n1 First-Sphere Gargantua\r\n1 Graveshifter\r\n1 Headless Specter\r\n1 Mind Rake\r\n1 Mob\r\n1 Plague Engineer\r\n1 Putrid Goblin\r\n1 Rank Officer\r\n1 Return from Extinction\r\n1 Umezawa's Charm\r\n1 Warteye Witch\r\n[/Black]\r\n\r\n[Red]\r\n1 Bladeback Sliver\r\n1 Firebolt\r\n1 Goblin War Party\r\n1 Hollowhead Sliver\r\n1 Igneous Elemental\r\n1 Lava Dart\r\n1 Magmatic Sinkhole\r\n1 Pillage\r\n1 Pyrophobia\r\n1 Quakefoot Cyclops\r\n1 Reckless Charge\r\n1 Throes of Chaos\r\n1 Viashino Sandsprinter\r\n[/Red]\r\n\r\n[Green]\r\n1 Deep Forest Hermit\r\n1 Elvish Fury\r\n1 Krosan Tusker\r\n1 Mother Bear\r\n1 Regrowth\r\n1 Spore Frog\r\n1 Springbloom Druid\r\n1 Squirrel Nest\r\n1 Treefolk Umbra\r\n1 Treetop Ambusher\r\n1 Trumpeting Herd\r\n1 Weather the Storm\r\n2 Winding Way\r\n[/Green]\r\n\r\n[Other]\r\n1 Etchings of the Chosen\r\n1 Ingenious Infiltrator\r\n1 Lavabelly Sliver\r\n2 Nature's Chant\r\n1 Unsettled Mariner\r\n1 Arcum's Astrolabe\r\n1 Birthing Boughs\r\n1 Lesser Masticore\r\n1 Talisman of Conviction\r\n1 Universal Automaton\r\n2 Cave of Temptation\r\n1 Lonely Sandbar\r\n1 Prismatic Vista\r\n1 Secluded Steppe\r\n1 Snow-Covered Plains\r\n1 Snow-Covered Island\r\n1 Snow-Covered Swamp\r\n2 Snow-Covered Mountain\r\n1 Snow-Covered Forest\r\n[/Other]\r\n\r\n{{/ cardlist }}\r\n\r\nThis sealed pool, like all the other MH1 pools I played, tends to pull you in different directions.

I don't have a record of my decklist for this pool, but I do remember my curve wasn't that good on the low end; I won the first round on the back of a Scale Up overrun, but lost the next 2 rounds due to being aggro'ed out and a bit of color screw. A bit discouraging, but I chalked it up to bad beats and kept my confidence for the main event.\r\n\r\nFinally, the main event! I arrived on Saturday early, ready to face the challenge.

Another sword (the better one, actually, since it stops black and red removal), some good rares, decent removal. White looked decent with Answered Prayers, On Thin Ice and Rhox Veteran, and red had some good removal, a few slivers and I had a Lavebelly, so I went W/R. The only problem with this build was that the creature count was a bit low, so I felt it wasn't a good idea to play all the Answered Prayers.

I won a quick round 1, which got me time for a quick lunch. Unfortunately, the low creature count bit me in round 2, where I was unable to close out the third game despite having the sword and Answered Prayers out. Round 3 was against an aggressive Mardu deck; I lost a quick game one, and I almost stabilized in game two but lost to a 2/2 I couldn't remove. I realized only after signing the match slip that I had two Lava Darts in the yard that I could flashback to stay alive. I beat myself up for a while over it, and had some food to psych myself up and avoid going on tilt, still hoping I could win the rest of the day. Unfortunately, my deck didn't come to play in Round 4, giving me 14 lands drawn in the 3rd game, leading to an easy defeat. I sadly dropped out of the main event at 1-3.\r\n\r\nDoing poorly at a GP always bums me out, especially when I had to travel for it. But I only had myself to blame for this one, since I came in with minimal experience with the format. I'm pretty sure my sealed deck build could have been more optimized too. I probably should have tempered my expectations and remind myself that Magic is a game of variance - skill only comes into play over a large number of events, and it's unwise to expect to be able to spike any single given event. I decided to just leave early and come back the next day for my traditional post-GP drop Chaos Sealed.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, when I came back the next day, I found out Chaos Sealed was cancelled due to lack of products. Perfect end to an unfortunate weekend. Not to be undone, I decided to just do a MH1 draft, and I managed to win 2 rounds and split the finals to win a few more packs and at least end the weekend on a high note.\r\n\r\nThat was it for me playing Magic. I did enjoy the rest of the MagicFest though, there were some enjoyable panels and side stuff. There were a lot of artists in the artist alley (though I didn't buy anything as usual), the usual cosplayers wandering about, and there was a really nice painting demo by Rob Alexander that I sat through on Friday. On Sunday, I watched this silly \"Match game\" event where the audience could win packs by trying to answer prompts and hoping they could match the answers by the panel made up of community personalities. I didn't win anything, but I was entertained watching the thing before I went to do my draft.\r\n\r\nThis is the 2nd time I've played a CFB GP, the first one was GP London back in 2015, but this is the first time since they've been given a monopoly on GPs worldwide. I will admit to being a bit annoyrd at the higher entry fees for the events, and the fact that the prize wall items seem to be more expensive now too. The GP playmat used to be complimentary with main event entry too, this time I had to pay a bit extra for it. I guess there are a lot of expenses, but the costs are discouraging me from considering travel to future GPs. Also, I miss that system by ChainLinks (who used to manage the SEA GPs) where they give each player a lanyard for the weekend which could be used to enter events and tracks your dci number and prize points. For this GP, they gave out physical cards to represent your prize points, and this almost got me in trouble because I accidentally left them at the AirBNB when I headed out on Sunday and had to double back to get them. CFB also had online pairings, but I wish they did that thing where you could subscribe to an FB messenger bot that would message you automatically with your pairings. They did have some nice tech usage like having restaurant-style buzzers for on-demand events though.\r\n\r\nAfter very time I do poorly at a GP, I ask myself whether I should quit playing Magic competitively. Or at least the travelling for GPs part. It is kind of a young man's game after all. Anyway, Magic Arena gives me a good outlet for playing Magic competitively without leaving the comfort of home, so that helps. But it's hard to say for sure, we'll see where the future takes us.\r\n\r\n",

I thought it would be fun to look back at the past 10 years of MCU Phase 1-3 and see what I wrote about the movies.\r\n\r\nIron Man (2008) \r\n\r\nSurprisingly, I had written nothing about watching this film at all, and I don't remember going to the cinema to watch it. The movie came out between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, so my hype was undeniably towards the Batman movies back then. Before the MCU, Iron Man was a B-list hero at best, and back then no one could ever have imagined how far the MCU would go.\r\n\r\nThe Incredible Hulk (2008)\r\n\r\nFrom \"Movies -- June 2008\":\r\n\r\n Edward Norton is cast brilliantly here, a choice on the same level as Robert Downey Jr as Iron Man. And they addressed the issue of Hulk’s stretchy pants!\r\n\r\nIron Man 2 (2010)\r\n\r\nIt took them 2 years to get to a 2nd movie. They probably weren't prepared for how well received Iron Man was!\r\n\r\nAll I have for this movie is from a tweet:\r\n\r\n Iron Man 2 was okay, but it was pretty much more of the same. Therefore it does not wow as much as the first movie did.\r\n\r\nThor (2011)\r\n\r\nCouldn't find any notes about this movie either. Well, except that I thought it was better than Green Lantern (an understatement). I do remember being impressed visually by the Asgard set-pieces.\r\n\r\nCaptain America the First Avenger (2011)\r\n\r\nFrom twitter:\r\n\r\n Captain America was fine. Definitely better than Thor/Green Lantern\r\n\r\nI guess I started ranking them around this time, although maintaing an overall ranking was pretty much impossible.\r\n\r\nAvengers (2012)\r\n\r\nFrom twitter:\r\n\r\n Avengers was very enjoyable, funny and action-packed. Re-reading Ultimates v1 now lol\r\n\r\nI wish I had more to say, but I wasn't in the habit yet of more detailed reviews back then. On to phase two!\r\n\r\nIron Man 3 (2013)\r\n\r\nFrom twitter:\r\n\r\n #IronMan3 It was ok. Not as great as some people have said, but probably better than 2. @alvinjtang says it'll look worse in a few years.\r\n\r\nThor The Dark World (2013)\r\n\r\nFrom twitter:\r\n\r\n Thor2 was okay, I like it more than Iron Man 3, mostly because I like the Star Wars x High Fantasy style\r\n\r\nThor2 is generally considered one of the lowest-ranked movies of the MCU, but as a comic book fan I'm very forgiving and I guess this means I generally liked all of them!\r\n\r\nCaptain America Winter Solider (2014)\r\n\r\nFrom twitter:\r\n\r\n Cap America 2 snap judgment: fun movie, better than Iron Man 3/Thor 2. Great for comic fans!\r\n\r\nAgain, an understatement, as I would later go on to consider Winter Soldier possibly my favorite MCU movie of all time.\r\n\r\nI also said in a Facebook post that the movie would have been perfect if he had only done Final Justice lol.\r\n\r\nGuardians of the Galaxy (2014)\r\n\r\nFrom a Facebook post:\r\n\r\n Guardians was a very funny and fun movie, but it's hard to say best Marvel movie so far, since I really liked Winter Soldier. And as a comic fan, I'm not that fond of how the Nova Corps was portrayed; I guess it's understandable since they're not the heroes here. There's a lot of stuff for comic fans to enjoy though\r\n\r\n2014 was a great year for the MCU, as both of these movies are among my MCU favorites.\r\n\r\nAge of Ultron (2015)\r\n\r\nFrom a Facebook post:\r\n\r\n Spoiler-free Age of Ultron review: It's great, go watch it. I loved it. I wish there had been less content made available ahead of time through trailers and casting announcements, but such are the times we live in. It is a good time to be a comic book fan. There is a short mid-credits scene. There is no post-credits scene\r\n\r\nIt was around this time that I started doing \"spoiler-free reviews\". I also posted a more detailed AoU review over on Nedstarkdies.\r\n\r\nAnt Man (2015)\r\n\r\nFrom a Facebook post again:\r\n\r\n Ant Man spoiler-free review: The first half felt a bit off, with some exposition coming off as forced and the pacing a bit awkward. Things picked up later on and while the plot was not entirely unpredictable there were a number of fun and surprising tangents. Overall a fun and entertaining movie with enough stuff for comic book Marvel fans to enjoy, probably close in quality to the first Iron Man movie, if not better\r\n\r\nI realized just now that both Ant Man movies have been used as a palate cleanser after an Avengers film. This first one also marked the end of phase two. On to phase three!\r\n\r\nCaptain America Civil War (2016)\r\n\r\nFrom Facebook:\r\n\r\nCaptain America Civil War spoiler-free review:\r\n\r\n - great fight sequences, start to finish\r\n - the newcomers were great, airport big fight sequence had a great surprise (and not the one you already saw in the trailer - although you might have already been spoiled if you pay attention to certain toy lines), although I feel like a couple of the characters were pulled in to the conflict in a way that was a bit weak, but it's still pretty good overall\r\n - the plot was ok. Justification for the civil war was ok. Some surprises. The villain motivation was slightly mediocre, but that wasn't really the focus of the movie anyway\r\n - Martin Freeman's role felt totally superfluous - it did not seem necessary to cast Martin Freeman\r\n - the movie kind of ends with the MCU and the Avengers in a weird place, some people might not like it\r\n - better than: Winter Soldier. The plot kind of develops in the same way but everything is on a much bigger scale now\r\n - there are two post-credit scenes, one in the middle and one at the very end\r\n - Imax worth it? Probably. Not very ostentatious use of 3d, but most of the fight sequences have it. You might get dizzy if you're not used to it\r\n - Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? Maybe, but I'd have to keep explaining who these characters are\r\n\r\nI started doing this format of \"Spoiler-free reviews\" around this time, with what would turn out to be the well-loved \"Magugustuhan ba ni Mama?\" (Translation: Will Mama like it?) section. When I tried removing this section at some point, people complained lol.\r\n\r\nDoctor Strange (2016)\r\n\r\nFrom Facebook:\r\n \r\n - Wow. Great visuals and fight-scenes, very trippy. Possibly the best fight scenes in all the MCU movies so far. You might get dizzy with all the things spinning around though\r\n - Plot is typical of a MCU origin story. Hero's journey, some light comedy bits, etc.\r\n - I was expecting them to go a different way with Mordo (if you've read the comics you know what I mean), but I'm happy with how things went down\r\n - Stakes are high, but failure is not final\r\n - The actors were great; I haven't seen a lead this good for a role since RDJ's Tony Stark. Swinton's Ancient One, Eijofor's Mordo, and even Wong's Wong were great\r\n - Doctor friends: Tell me if the medical parts were BS hohoho\r\n - Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Probably not. She doesn't like this kind of thing, and the dizziness thing is bad too\r\n - IMAX or not? I think the 3d parts weren't too exaggerated or critical, but the visuals might feel a bit flat and not as impressive if you don't go IMAX\r\n - Midcredits scene? Yes\r\n - Postcredits scene? Yes\r\n\r\nGuardians of the Galaxy vol 2 (2017)\r\n\r\nFrom Facebook:\r\n\r\n - overall a very entertaining movie to sit down and watch popcorn and to enjoy the jokes and the space battles and the different colored lights and the tiny adorable tree creature\r\n - GOTG's humor was one of its strong points and for the 2nd movie, they push the comedy up a notch, perhaps a little too much in some places. Lots of funny gags and one-liners\r\n - I felt like some of the character/background development stuff was pushed a bit too hard as well\r\n - the movie's plot also felt a bit thin and straightforward. I mean, you could see some of the major plot points coming a mile away. Maybe from the trailers even\r\n - Star Lord was ok. Gamora/Nebula felt poorly written. Rocket was a bit annoying. Drax and Mantis were ok, although the space they have for Mantis' character overlaps with Drax a bit.. I'm still not super happy with how Drax and Gamora are characterized in the MCU.\r\n - I'm less happy with this movie's soundtrack compared to the first one\r\n - Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Certainly not. In fact, she chose to derp around the mall instead of coming with me and my cousin to watch.\r\n - IMAX or not: Some visuals used the 3d effect, but nothing too exaggerated or critical. I'd say IMAX optional, but it definitely adds something to some scenes.\r\n - There are five extra scenes near the credits (one of them is right before the credits roll, so I can't really say \"post-credit\" screens). Most of them are just setting the tone for the inevitable GOTG3\r\n - Additionally, just pay attention to the background of the credits roll as well, it's great\r\n - While I felt the movie was ok, it's kind of just more of the same of what we got with the first movie, which felt a lot stronger overall\r\n\r\nSpider-man Homecoming (2017)\r\n\r\nFrom Facebook:\r\n\r\n - This movie is amazing. Possibly best in all MCU so far. It's fun, it's exciting, unexpected things happened. Maybe not watching the trailers helped lol\r\n - Covers a lot of ground the previous Spider-man movies didn't. Helped along by not needing to rehash the origin story for the Nth time\r\n - Lots of great call outs for the comic book fans\r\n - I was worried about the Vulture, but it was handled very well. Keaton is great here.\r\n - This movie is tightly coupled to the MCU yo. IDK how they're going to handle it if Sony breaks it off after the two-movie deal. By they I mean Sony. Obviously MCU can just ignore him forever afterwards.\r\n - TBH I was also really worried about the MCU coupling and having too much Iron Man in the movie, but it turned out okay. Maybe could have had a little bit less Tony Stark.\r\n - IMAX? Probably not worth it.\r\n - there's a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene.\r\n - Magugustuhan ba ni Mama? Possibly! There's some shaky cam footage near the start that can be a bit nauseating though\r\n\r\nThat first line is high praise lol. Around this time I started avoiding watching more than the first trailer for the MCU movies, as I always felt like they gave too many jokes and plot points away. I will certainly watch them anyway, so there wasn't much point building up more hype than I needed to.\r\n\r\nThor Ragnarok (2017):\r\n\r\nFrom Facebook:\r\n\r\n - a fun, action-packed romp that shakes up the Thor status quo significantly\r\n - easily the best of the three Thor movies\r\n - a number plot points are fairly predictable, yet still fun\r\n - the Marvel formula is generally action mixed with witty banter here and there, and it's what we get here, although some of the jokes feel like they're stretched a bit too much\r\n - some great-looking cinematic scenes here and there. One particular flashback scene looked really great\r\n - I kind of like how the older franchises need to be some sort of team effort nowadays. Like Civil War, this felt a bit like some kind of mini-Avengers crossover -- in space!\r\n - speaking of space, one of the positive things about this installment is that they didn't feel the need to tie Thor's adventures to Earth anymore (not that the movie is 100% Earth-free), and they get to go a bit wild with space and aliens and all that\r\n - I understand the need to highlight Hulk's involvement as part of the film's marketing, but man, it would have been so awesome to just find out right then and there\r\n - This movie had that Star Wars: Last Jedi trailer I was trying to avoid D:\r\n - 1 mid-credits scene and 1 post-credits scene\r\n - I think Imax was good for this movie. The 3d wasn't too much and it definitely made some scenes pop. The film is a visual delight so I think the larger screen is important too\r\n - Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Probably not. Maybe I should stop including this section kasi parang same na parati ang answer. Unless for some reason I decide to watch some Tagalog romcom\r\n\r\nDamn Thor 3 was great. Looking forward to Love and Thunder!\r\n\r\nBlack Panther (2018)\r\n \r\nFrom Facebook:\r\n\r\n - it's a fun, action-filled romp and Wakanda is amazing\r\n - tchalla was ok, killmonger and nakia were great, shuri was badass\r\n - some of the actions scenes didnt seem too well-shot/edited, making them hard to follow\r\n - I realize I'm saying this about a universe where there are talking raccoons and magic hammers, but some of the Wakandan tech push the boundaries of my suspension of disbelief\r\n - my expectations were probably set a bit too high what with some people saying it's the best MCU movie since Iron Man or calling it revolutionary or eye-opening\r\n - off the top of my head I'd say I consider Civil War, Spider-Man Homecoming and Thor Ragnarok better than this one\r\n - I understand that it's revolutionary in the sense that it's a major hollowood motion picture filled with a cast of mostly african descent and that some of the characters are motivated by real world racial issues. But the plot itself was typical for an MCU first movie (maybe I've seen too many MCU movies? lol). I dont think it presents the issues it covers under any new or revolutionary context. I guess I kind of went in hoping to be impressed on the level of The Dark Knight or such, but I was disappointed in that regard. It's a very straightforward movie\r\n - I didn't watch in Imax, which I kind of regret, as I can imagine some of the scenes being pretty good\r\n - Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Possibly, pero baka mahirapan sya intindihin accent ni Chadwick Boseman\r\n - There's a mid-credits scene and a post-credits scene\r\n\r\nAvengers Infinity War (2018)\r\n\r\nFrom Facebook:\r\n\r\n - I'm amazed that so little of this movie has been widely spoiled\r\n - movie was fantastic. the movie somehow managed to do everything it needed to do while not doing disservice to any of the bazillion characters involved.\r\n - the plot moves quickly. there is no good time to pee.\r\n - there is one post-credits scene.\r\n - very happy to have watched in imax\r\n  \r\nAnt Man and the Wasp (2018)\r\n\r\nFrom Facebook:\r\n\r\n - this movie is great; it's fun and and action-packed and there's even more Luis than you thought you wanted; go watch it\r\n - it's like the first movie, except better and more fun\r\n - best new character: FBI Agent Jimmy Woo played by Randall Park (sorry Michelle Pfeifer)\r\n - there are two mid/post-credit scenes. One of them is better than the other\r\n - I watched in Imax. Some scenes were nice, but it's probably more of a nice-to-have\r\n - Magugustuhan ba ni Mama: Pwede, but kelangan ng kasama to explain things. Baka ok lang pag tagalized na sa tv\r\n\r\nCaptain Marvel (2019)\r\n\r\nAround this time, I started posting the reviews to Tumblr as well: \r\n\r\n - movie was pretty good, no major issues\r\n - doesnt follow the typical MCU origin story ‘formula’\r\n - some weird pacing issues in a few places, but that just might be because of the chosen story direction\r\n - lots of little call-outs and tie-ins to the other MCU movies (although I feel like they could have done a bit more in some spots)\r\n - I am not a cat person. But if you are a cat person, you might like this: there is a cat.\r\n - There’s some parts that made it obvious they were aiming for that Wonder Woman audience, so the movie may be better for you if you’re in that demo (but I think WW was a better movie overall)\r\n - Imax was pretty good, nothing too excessive\r\n - Midcredits scene, and postcredits scene\r\n - Magugustuhan ba ni mama? Possibly! Also, its a good idea to bring little girls to watch this movie\r\n  \r\nAvengers Endgame (2019)\r\n\r\nYou can read my review right here on this blog!\r\n\r\nSpider-man Far From Home (2019)\r\n\r\nYou can read my review right here on this blog!\r\n\r\nThat was a fun walk through a decade of films, and it gave me an opportunity to fold some of my off-blog content back into this blog. I'm hoping to be doing more movie reviews directly here on this blog instead of just on Facebook or Tumblr. Looking forward to more MCU in the years (decades?) to come!",

To make a long story short, I decided to start working on a Hugo theme. It's still largely a work in progress, as there's a bunch of things I wanted to implement. But it was good enough to replace the old one so I went ahead and deployed it, so maybe some bugs here and there on some pages. And I'm still tinkering, so probably some minor/major changes as we go along in the next few weeks. Or months. Who knows how long it will take? There were some conflicts with the old theme and the new theme which meant I had to modify some of my main blog files to support the new theme and the amount of uncommitted changes I had was getting unwieldy, so I figured I'd just \"move fast and break things\", as it were. (I realize that a more sensible programmer would have done the theme work on a branch to avoid this nonsense, but we are who we are.)\r\n\r\nAnyway, here's a snapshot of the current appearance, for posterity:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI've also back-updated some of the older posts where I updated the site theme/layout with a tag changelog, so that I can reference them when I update the about page sometime soonish.\r\n\r\nAside from my general finnickiness about wanting a new theme approximately every 17 days, another reason I wanted to change the layout was I wanted to try out CSS grid layouting, as it seemed neat and boy I wish this existed back in the IE6 days. Would've made things a lot easier.\r\n\r\nI've also kind of gone down the rabbit hole of Indieweb stuff. The core message of having your own website that contains all your content appeals to me and also aligns with some things I've been thinking about implementing like importing all of my off-site content into this site as a central repository. Those things are yet to come but with the theme change I've also started looking into stuff like microformats (should be supported as of now), webmentions, POSSE, and so on. Might be a while before those other things get done though.\r\n\r\nI full technical breakdown of the theme features belongs in the theme's README and probably in a separate colophon post later on, but we're not there yet and we'll get there when we get there.\r\n\r\nFor now, enjoy if you will my obsession with the color green.",

        "content": "---\r\nauthor: roy\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2019-07-20 05:56:56\r\ntags:\r\nsoftware development\r\nreact native\r\nmobile\r\ntitle: 'Upgrading a React Native Project'\r\ntype: post\r\n---\r\n\r\nI have a small mobile app that I wrote using React Native (henceforth RN) back in 2017, currently deployed on the Google Play Store and Apple App Store. Shortly before my US trip, I got an email from Google telling me about a required action:\r\n\r\n By August 1, 2019, all apps that use native code must provide a 64-bit version in addition to the 32-bit version in order to publish an update. This past January, we reiterated that this is required in order to make way for innovation and in anticipation of future Android devices that only support 64-bit code.\r\n \r\n As the deadline approaches, we wanted to remind you that at least one of your apps* uses native code but does not currently offer a 64-bit variant\r\n\r\nThis illustrates for me one of the big problems with mobile development: that app was perfectly fine when I last deployed it in 2018 and now even though I haven't changed anything, there's additional work that needs to be done. I guess I'm too used to web development where we just deploy the app on a server and the server architecture doesn't suddenly change for no reason. With mobile apps, the platforms and APIs and frameworks change quickly, leading to situations where even if your app doesn't have any pending changes, you need to do some work on it anyway. (Granted, this can also happen with webservers due to security patches and such, but with managed hosting, that's not something you worry about as often, and the resolution is often straightforward!)\r\n\r\nAs I was about to be out of the country on vacation for more than a month, I put this off and only started looking at it when I got back. Luckily, I did actually also have some minor revisions to do on the app, so I would do all the work in one go.\r\n\r\nAs it turns out, the version of RN I was using was too old and did not support providing the 64-bit version. I had to upgrade to a later version of RN, and after reviewing the process, it seemed like a nontrivial amount of work. There was an upgrade tool, but because I was so many versions behind, it couldn't work directly. The problem seems to be in the initial boilerplate created by react-native init for the ios and android subprojects; the older boilerplate was out of date and needed to be updated, which was not straightforward given that you may have modified that boilerplate afterwards. I had to use some kind of diff tool to manually find the differences in the boilerplate and merge the changes manually.\r\n\r\nThat seemed like a lot of work, and the app wasn't that large and didn't have that much code, so I figured it was more straightforward to just create a new RN project from scratch, which would be using the latest version of RN (0.60.3, from 0.50.4). Afterwards, I port over the project code into the new project, them swap the new project back into the old project's repo. That way I only had to update the few dependencies I was using in the project itself. \r\n\r\nIt was still a nontrivial amount of work, but I eventually got everything working through many iterations of trial-and-error.\r\n\r\nI went ahead and upgraded the dependencies to the latest versions as well, to make sure there was no conflict with the new RN version\r\nReactNavigation had some backward incompatible changes:\r\n  needed to initialize the gesture handler in the java class \r\n  new function createStackNavigator instead of just StackNavigator constructor\r\n  needed to use createAppContainer to initialize the navigator\r\nsome components such as WebView and AsyncStorage were no longer part of RN core and had to be imported accordingly\r\nAndroid now requires that I explicitly prompt for the READEXTERNALSTORAGE permission when trying to access the camera roll \r\nGoogle now recommends that I provide an upload key for encryption, but since I reset the project, I also accidentally deleted the signing key I was using before. Oops! Momentary panic until I have the sense to do a search and realize that past me was wise enough to backup the file elsewhere. \r\nTest that I can create the app bundle successfully.\r\n  \r\nBy this point I more or less had a working Android build, then shifted over to iOS. Since I only recently got a Macbook Air, I actually hadn't tried creating and publishing the iOS build, someone was helping me with that part before. Because of reasons, I wanted/had to do it myself this time around, so a bit of a learning curve and trial-and-error again.\r\n\r\nclone the project from repo, npm install, try react-native run-ios, oops missing dependencies\r\nfind out about CocoaPods. Clone a fresh copy of the project, npm install then pod install (took a while), then try react-native run-ios again\r\nneeded to fix some dependencies I was using by manual linking and updating\r\ncamera roll also needed to be added to the podfile (a config I possibly lost when I reset the project)\r\nfix a bunch of configs before I can actually run and test the app in the simulator\r\nSuccess! \r\n\r\nAt this point, I make my other app changes and test on both my Android phone and the iOS simulator. The changes are easy, so now to try publishing.\r\n \r\nTry to publish and upload to iTunesConnect. Takes me a few tries to figure out that I need to be updating stuff like bundle identifier, version number, etc. \r\niTunesConnect has some new requirements too (like the iPad version needs to support all orientations) which causes a couple more iterations\r\nmore screenshots are now required when submitting the app!\r\nI set up TestFlight and verify everything is ok with the published app. (I only tested using the simulator before)\r\niOS app now submitted and \"Waiting for Review\". I anticipate they will have some ridiculous request and it might take me a couple more submission rounds before I can publish\r\nGoogle Play is more straightforward. gradlew releaseBundle is already working after my previous effort, so I just upload the bundle and distribute.\r\n\r\nI see no indication that I have satisfied Google's action item, but it let me publish the update without complaints, so I'm done!\r\n\r\nMy initial estimate that the work was nontrivial ends up correct, I spent way more manhours than I expected on the upgrade. Part of it was learning how to do the iOS deployment, so hopefully that ends up easier in the future.\r\n\r\n",

Upon handling my phone, she commented \"you know you're battery's expanding, right? That's dangerous, it could explode or such\", but I shrugged it off. I'm no stranger to batteries expanding, it happened before to my old Samsung Galaxy phones and I had to buy replacement batteries then. Unfortunately, the Zenfone Max 4 did not have a replacement battery, so that was out of the question. I ignored it for a while, and just hoped the phone would last until the end of the trip.\r\n\r\nDuring the rest of the trip, I would notice it was starting to pop out of its case, and I had to push down on it to hold it together, and I accepted that I had to get a new phone as soon as I got home. Even performance-wise I had noticed in recent weeks that it was already quite sluggish. Literally during the flight back home while the phone was powered off in my pocket, I would bring it out and need to push it back together again, I was worried I wouldn't have a phone when I landed. I guess it's fortunate that the phone made it all the way home.\r\n\r\nLuckily, I had a contract renewal available with Globe, which meant I could get a new handset. Even before the flight home I started looking at their website to see what handsets I could get; the choices were either an IPhone (way too expensive), a midrange Samsung Galaxy A-series phone, and a Chinese-manufactured phone (Huawei or Oppo). I'm not fond of the idea of Chinese telecom companies, so I decided to go with a Samsung again. I had used two Samsung phones before, both Galaxy S's, so I was kind of coming home, I guess?\r\n\r\nI settled on the Samsung Galaxy A50, as it was the best midrange phone there. My P999 plan meant I had to do a bit of a cashout, but that was fine. Specs-wise, it compared favorably to the Zenfone Max 4, except for the battery which was 20% less than the Zenfone. The high battery life was why I chose the Zenfone in the first place, so I figured the slight drop would be tolerable. Another minor concern was that the new phone would be USB-C, my first such device. It meant I wouldn't be able to reuse all my old MicroUSB cables, but I guess that's not much of a loss.\r\n\r\nI thought about doing the contract renewal over the phone, but that meant having to wait a few days for delivery or pickup. I was worried the old phone might die soon (experience shows it'll probably chug along for a while though), and I wanted an excuse to go to the mall, so I did the renewal at the Globe store instead. It was a pretty quick and painless process (fill up a few forms, wait in a queue, yada yada all done), and I had a new handset two days after I came back from the trip.\r\n\r\nThe handset itself looks pretty good and as expected it's performing a lot better than the older phone, since this unit just came out early this year. It's a lot thinner and slightly taller and has a cool reflective back frame. There's a triple camera that reviews tell me are really good but I wouldn't know because I'm terrible at photography. Maybe I'll take some comparison shots with the old phone if I feel like it. The battery life is reasonable, looks like it could last a full day if I do a full charge.\r\n\r\nOne thing I want to do differently this time to try to maximize the battery life is to avoid leaving the phone charging overnight, since that's supposedly bad for battery life. Like many other things, I'm a bit obsessive-compulsive about my phone's battery always being charged, so I like having the phone fully charged when I wake up in the mornings. (My friends will happily tell you that if they send me a phone screenshot where their battery is at like 13% my first comment would be that they need to charge.) This time I will try to wean myself off that habit, let's see how that works out.\r\n\r\n",

I was worried this would be a problem but it worked out fine, it wasn't a problem and was handled well\r\nThere is a mid-credits scene, possibly one of the best I've ever seen, in terms of how it changes the entire tone of the movie. There is also a post-credits scene, the implications of which are still unclear and will leave the fanbase speculating for a while\r\nMagugustuhan ba ni Mama: Possibly! There's a lot of \"cute\" Peter Parker high school moments she'd probably like, and the plot and action aren't too hard to follow\r\n\r\nSpoilery stuff follows:\r\n\r\nhow could Midtown High afford to send their trivia team on a trip through Europe? Is this typical of American high schools?\r\nAs mentioned above, anyone even remotely familiar with Spider-Man lore wouldn't be surprised at the reveal that Mysterio is actually a villain. This is one of those times where there would have been some advantage to not knowing stuff ahead of time, as you get to enjoy the reveal. That being said, Mysterio's villain monologue after getting the EDITH glasses may be one of the best I've ever seen. Since I already knew Mysterio was a bad guy, the only realy mystery was HOW he was doing these destructive elementals since they obviously weren't the simple light-and-sound shows that comics Mysterio was known for. Tying the illusions to the BARF holograms and even re-using side characters from previous movies was an inspired choice.\r\nthe rest of the movie's plot was fairly predictable, but the MCU continues to subvert the expectations of Spider-Man fans since both Peter Parker and the supporting cast are completely different from the comicbook incarnations, powers notwithstanding. I assume they planned as far back as Homecoming that Tony would be dying in Endgame and Peter would be pressured to take the mantle, setting Tony up as his father figure instead of the mythical Uncle Ben. Zendaya's MJ is completely different from the comics' Mary Jane \"Hey tiger\" Watson; Flash is a nerd like Peter instead of a footballer; Ned isn't even based on a Peter supporting character but on a Miles supporting character, and so on. This is basically a completely different version of Peter's HS life and it's great.\r\nthat first Mysterio vs Spider-Man scene was great, evocative of the comic book version and even Arkham Asylum's Scarecrow sequences\r\nthe whole Peter/MJ/Brad Davis subplot gives the movie a bit of a \"John Hughes\" vibe and there are some cute moments and MJ really holds her own; I think this movie handles the whole \"dual identity problems\" aspect of Spider-man better than Homecoming did\r\nthat webswinging sequence at the end of the movie was great, has the same feel as the PS4 game\r\nthe midcredits scene completely changes the tone of the ending of course. But first, we must acknowledge the awesome return of the one true J. Jonah Jameson, JK Simmons! The unmasking is a problem, and how will they handle it? Will Peter and May have to go into hiding at an Avengers facility? Will the bad guys come after them? WIll Peter have to make a deal with Mephisto to protect his secret in exchange for getting the worst prom ever with MJ? Or will they go some other route like have one of the Skrulls pose as Peter and appear together with Spider-man? The great thing about MCU Spider-Man is that because the setup is completely different, they're not beholden to the comic book plots (neither Homecoming nor Far From Home are based on actual comic stories AFAIK). This ending also mirrors Homecoming's unmasking in front of Aunt May, so my guess is that they'll handle this cliffhanger the same way - completely off screen and we just see the repurcussions in the next movie.\r\nthe final postcredits scene will have fans speculating for a while, but it looks like Fury is busy setting up SWORD? Or could it be something else?\r\n\r\nGreat movie, and I'm looking forward to Marvel hopefully announcing their Phase 4 plans at SDCC later this month!\r\n\r\n\r\n",

Well, I tried at least.\r\n\r\nThis one is a photo of some Deceptions taken using the Samsung Galaxy A50 camera, default settings:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere's a similar photo taken using the Asus Zenfone Max 4 camera, default settings:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThings look quite a bit more washed out, is that the proper term? I did like five different takes of this and they all came out around the same way. Maybe there's some setting I need to adjust? Or I'm focusing wrong? Like I said, I don't know much about photography, though it's something I wouldn't mind improving on, even with just a phone camera. I guess I need to learn things like focusing, lighting, etc. And I don't really understand many of the phone camera features either! I suspect it will take a lot of trial and error on my part, so that may take a while haha.\r\n\r\nFor reference, I also tried this with the new 2018 iPad, which had a pretty good camera as well, the shot turned out ok, closer to the A50 one.\r\n\r\nI also took an extra shot of Rippersnapper with the Galaxy A50 and the detail in the shot was pretty sweet, I posted it on instagram.\r\n\r\n",

I had travelled abroad before for a longer period (3 months for London in 2015), but for those 3 months I was based in the same place and didn't need anybody's help to move around the city, etc.\r\n\r\nI can get a bit crazy in planning for possible problems. Loss of passport is probably the worst-case scenario, followed by getting sick/injured while abroad (especially since I'm wary of the expensiveness of US health care), and of course there's the possibility all your other stuff getting lost or stolen. In case of catastophe, I set up an online URL (known only to me) where I can access emergency info such as my passport details, contact number for relatives, and so on. Of course I also have paper printouts of needed info.\r\n\r\nBy my own count, I had ridden on an airplane 23 times now in my lifetime (19 international, 1 domestic PH, 3 domestic US), but I still worry a lot about any given flight. There are multiple possible points of failure for any one flight, some of them unique to the US, specifically:\r\n\r\nneed to arrive at the airport on time, without forgetting your travel documents\r\nneed to pass security/immigration/customs. Added feature this time was the stricter TSA screening. And the customs form I needed to fill up as I entered the US gave me some worry as well, because I was carrying some foodstuffs meant to be given to relatives and I wasn't sure if I had to declare them or not (apparently the default answer is just don't declare them? IDK). I had a similar issue on the way back into the PH, but even though I was given a customs form to fill up, no one actually asked for it?!? ¯\\\\\\(ツ)\\/¯\r\nneed to pray that your checked luggage doesn't get lost or stolen from. Additionally, in the US, the TSA may open your checked luggage outside of your presence, and if you're using a non-TSA approved luggage lock, they will break your lock to do so. I had the misfortune of getting this souvenir from the TSA because of this (I have since purchased TSA-approved locks)\r\nneed to make sure no one else claims your checked baggage at the carousel\r\nwill I even be able to sleep during the long haul flight? Undoubtably yes, but only in very short bursts that I presume are not healthy. Airplane economy seats are often very uncomfortable for me and and have very little leg room, and the seat backs are not conducive to me sleeping. I am so uncomfortable on airplanes that I've come to realize that me preparing movies/books/comics/games to entertain me during the flight is a waste of time, as I typically won't indulge in those activities when I'm not very comfortable. Typically, a long haul flight goes like this for me:\r\n  Try to sleep\r\n  Wake up after 2-8 minutes due to some noise or due to my neck hurting\r\n  Check the flight status/time to see how much longer I have to tolerate this nonsense\r\n  Stare for a while into the void, doing nothing, hoping I can somehow make this flight go by faster\r\n  (Optional) Get up and go to the 0.5 square meter lavatory so I can stretch my legs\r\n  Make tiny adjustment in neck or butt or leg position(s) and hope that helps me sleep better\r\n  Repeat\r\n\r\n\r\nThe start of my trip gave me some anxiety as well, when I went to the check-in counter at NAIA, the Asiana lady could not scan my machine-readable passport, presumably due to a fold on the relevant page. She said she would process me manually but warned me that there was a possibility that they would reject my passport at my US entry point since a machine-readable passport was a requirement. I even had to sign a waiver absolving Asiana of any liability in case I was not allowed to enter the US! Basically they gave me reason to be worried during the entire length of the 18-hour trip to SFO. Spoilers: there was no issue at the US border, and there was never any further issue scanning my passport at any point including at the e-Gate as I was re-entering the PH. (Props to NAIA for having e-Gates now.)\r\n\r\nAnother issue I encountered was because this was my first time actually visiting relatives during a trip, so I was not prepared for the Filipino culture thing of having your relatives give you stuff to bring back home. I always pack as lightly as possible and have a small luggage unit specifically because I don't want to have to worry about lugging around a lot of weight. Because of this, on my way back to Seattle from Houston, and from Seattle to Sacramento, I had to handcarry a large paper back with stuff for my folks and siblings. I did not have a spare bag to carry the items, and on the trip to Sacramento, the bag was even slightly ripped, I did not have a contingency plan for if it fell apart. Luckily, things worked out lol.\r\n\r\nI mentioned in the previous post that I don't really do much shopping, but my parents did, and we ended up having 3 additional checked luggage pieces ((all of them near the 50lbs limit), which meant I had to carry one myself during my flight. (We were flying back on the same day, but had separate flights). This added to bit about my anxiety, as what if some customs official asked me what I had in the large luggage and I had no idea? Luckily again, things worked out.\r\n\r\nAside from the flights, I also had to arrange for lodging, as not all the places we were going to had friends or relatives we could crash at. I ended up using 3 different AirBNBs, one each in Anaheim, Los Angeles and Seattle. AirBNBs come with their own set of anxieties:\r\n\r\nwill I be able to find the place?\r\nwill there be an issue with the check in process?\r\ncan I trust the host not to steal my stuff or spy on my with a hidden camera or something? The thing about AirBNBs is you basically have to trust strangers; one of my issues this time is I was travelling with a laptop, so I was worried that it might not be secure to leave the laptop at the AirBNB when I went out.\r\nis the AirBNB area secure? Can I walk around the area at night?\r\n\r\nHappily, I encountered no issues with the AirBNBs I rented and had pleasant stays all around.\r\n\r\n\"Luckily, things worked out\" is generally the outcome to be expected for most of these overthinking-type anxieties I guess. I know it's not rational to worry about all of these things a lot, and I understand the odds are low for any particular risk, but sometimes I can't help myself. Often I can manage the happy-go-lucky \"eh, I'm sure it'll be fine\" attitude for any single problem, but in this instance the fact that I had to worry about so many different flights (not to mention iteneraries like theme parks, meetups, etc) made it extra challenging. I guess I just need to remind myself not to worry too much. While there are certainly a lot of possible \"things that can go wrong\", most of them are easily recoverable from, and the odds are very low anyway. I've survived this long in a harsh environment like Metro Manila, so I can probably survive something going wrong in more \"civilized\" (?) countries like the US anyway!",

We were based in my uncle's place in Vacaville, which one of my friends kindly described as \"in the sticks\", i.e. basically far away from everything. Like Houston, we had to rely on the kindness of relatives who were willing and available to drive us around.\r\n\r\nThis was the laziest part of the trip by far: not much walking, most of it either just driving to places and taking pictures; or going to outlets for shopping.\r\n\r\nWe spent a few days near Monterey, staying at a cousin's house. This let us visit some nearby stuff like cannery row, the 17-mile drive and pebble beach. Climbed some rocks, saw some squirrels, walked by the wharf, that kind of stuff. After that, we also visited San Jose for a day to meet some other relatives, then the next day we drove over to San Francisco and visited the Golden Gate Bridge area, the Palace of Fine Arts (sadly closed on that day, but the exteriors were nice), and drove around the SF roads for a bit too. I was a bit underwhelmed by the Golden Gate bridge, it wasn't as long nor as wide as I imagined it would be, but from the exhibits there I can imagine what a big deal of an engineering feat it was at that time. The streets of SF were even steeper than Seattle's were! I'm glad I didn't have to walk them.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was just hanging out the Vacaville area and visiting (and revisiting) the outlets for shopping. Apparently Vacaville is known for the outlets. I'm not much of a shopper myself - I don't have the patience to sift through rows of clothes or shoes looking for bargains - it's mostly my parents who bought a bunch of stuff. I just walked around mostly looking at things.\r\n\r\nI did make a couple of electronics purchases, one was a cheap gaming mouse (not as cheap as the ones in the PH, but not like a $60 razer either), and the bigger purchase was a 2018 iPad from Best Buy. I wanted to get a new tablet because my current iPad Pro was falling apart (I literally had some tape at the seams to hold it together), and the battery was in horrible shape. I was hesitating because the iPad Pro was actually still perfectly usable - as long as it was plugged in and the tape held. At first I wanted to get a new iPad Pro, since I wanted the pencil support, but those were wildly expensive, and even the refurbished 9.7-inch ones would have cost as much as a new 2018 iPad. Luckily, I found out that the 2018 iPad did in fact support the Apple Pencil, so I ended up getting a new one of those instead. \r\n\r\nWe had a fourth of July barbecue at my uncle's house, and I stayed the night at a friend's house in Hercules, then more lazy days of shopping to wind down our US trip. Some overall impressions of the US and random stories follow:\r\n\r\neverything is so far apart. During our Houston and Vacaville legs we basically had to be driven everywhere. Probably basically impossible to live without a car (as I prefer) unless you're willing to pay the higher rents in the downtown areas. There's also so much idle land everywhere. Basically the opposite of congested Metro Manila. I have a better understanding now of why Americans are so obsessed with cars (and pickup trucks apparently) (Slight tangent: interesting article I read on why Americans are basically forced into car dependency by laws, infrastructure and big oil)\r\nno bidets! This is why Japan is superior\r\nI suppose it's only logical given how far apart things are, but this is the first country I've visited with wildly different climates in different zones. SF and LA were manageable hot - cool in the shade, but close to PH temps if you're in the sun in the afternoons. Vegas and Houston were very, very hot. Seattle was cold in the mornings and never got too hot during the day. \r\nAmericans are very chatty, even with strangers. I didn't expect them to be as chatty as Filipinos since we allegedly have a reputation for being \"warm and hospitable\", but Filipinos don't randomly ask how my day is going the way random people on the street do in the US. In Las Vegas, a large black woman was trying to chat up me and my brother while we were on a food run and we were ignoring her and she asked us why we were being so antisocial\r\nApparently Filipino expats in the US watch a lot of TFC and Telenovelas and Pinoy movies. Reminds them of home I guess. I actually sat through a couple of Pinoy movies myself, I'll write about them in the next watching lately.\r\nThere are so many, um, shall we say, \"large\" Americans. Not in terms of height, but in terms of width! Not that I'm fat shaming or anything like that - I mean, I'm a huge guy myself, but seeing so many larger folk around made me feel a bit more comfortable with myself. Some of the stores we went to had shirt sizes that went as high as 6x! I think the larger Americans I saw were mostly in the theme parks and the city areas, not so much in the suburbs, not sure if that's indicative of anything.\r\nI used Southwest for all the domestic flights. SW is interesting because they don't have reserved seatings for their flights - you're assigned a boarding priority and when you board you just pick from whatever seat is available. Also apparently they let me bring free checked baggage whereas other airlines don't so I guess I randomly made a good decision.\r\nUS airports don't seem very interesting, or maybe I'm just spoiled by airports like Singapore's Changi or HKIA where I don't mind spending a lot of time there\r\nI didn't spend as much as I thought I would (mostly due to the hospitality of our hosts), but still the fact that food is so expensive here really tells me a lot about how Americans view things financially. A decent meal is typically $10-$15, maybe more. Compare that to the cost of things that would be considered luxuries in the Philippines: a new video game is $60, basically 4 or 5 meals worth; a month's Netflix sub or a comic book are less than the cost of a meal; and so on. It basically makes it so easy to impulse buy say, a $1 chocolate bar or a $4 bag of chips since these are so inexpensive compared to normal meals, but over here I'd balk at P35 chocolate bars or P150 bag of chips. I guess I'm worried that having spent time in the US, I'd be more spendy when I get back lol.\r\nin summary, I was able to visit 4 states: California, Nevada, Texas, and Washington. (Arizona for a layover). Not bad! I didn't get to visit the East Coast during this trip, so maybe that's something to look forward to in the future. I am not yet sure if I even want to go back; maybe one trip is already plently, just enough to experience what life is like over there. ",

I had also read online that while Seattle was very much a walkable city, there was a nontrivial homeless population, and some areas may be a bit sketchy after dark. As a friend of mine said though, \"sketchy\" in the US is probably a lot safer than \"sketchy\" in Metro Manila. I still worried a little bit, but given where I from, it didn't make sense to worry about it.\r\n\r\nMy primary purpose for this leg of the trip was of course GP Seattle, but I also looked forward to being able to walk and explore the city by myself. Not that I don't enjoy hanging out and travelling with my family, but I enjoy being able to wander around freely by myself with no real agenda, letting my feet take me wherever. \r\n\r\nThat meant instead of theme parks and tourist attractions and shopping outlets, I found myself walking around looking into small bookstores, vintage shops, collectibles stores, hobby shops, gaming arcades, and so on. My poor performance at the GP main event gave me some extra time to wander the streets as well.\r\n\r\nI did hit a few tourist spots:\r\n\r\nI took some pictures at the Space Needle. Didn't bother going up, I felt like I've already climbed enough tall structures in my lifetime and it wasn't really worth the cost\r\nI did take half a day to go through the Museum of Pop Culture near the Space Needle, which I enjoyed. They had exhibits on Washington state bands like Pearl Jam and Nirvana, fantasy and sci-fi exhibits, and even an independent gaming exhibit sponsored by Nintendo. \r\nSupposedly, Seattle's number one tourist attraction is Pike Place Market, which I found weird, because well, it's a market. I did visit the market and wander the shop and had some of Beecher's \"World's Best Mac and Cheese\" (tastes great, but the cheese is very sharp, some people might not like it). There were some nice market shops - I enjoyed browsing a couple of the used bookstores there and there was a comic book store as well (was able to resist adding more to my reading backlog though). I think there was supposed to be some performance by the fishmongers in the market proper, and I did see some crowd gathered around one of the stalls and clapping, but I couldn't push through quick enough to see what was going on, and didn't bother waiting for something to happen again. \r\n\r\nOne thing I did not enjoy was how steeply inclined Seattle's streets were. Going from my Airbnb near Capitol Hill to the downtown area was easy enough as it was mostly downhill, but going back home at the end of the day was always a bit of a challenge.\r\n\r\nI like Seattle as a city, especially the Capitol Hill district - it feels like it has a lot of character, compared to say, Los Angeles (although that might be an unfair comparison as I didn't really get to wander LA much). The city has more of a west coast-artistic vibe going on, there's a lot of posters for events everywhere, art murals on a lot of walls, there's more music shops and book shops, a lot of random small parks, and a lot of place are very LGBTQ-friendly, even some of the crosswalks are rainbow-colored. The bookstores I browsed were great, a couple had the staff leaving small notes on the shelves about various titles they recommend. \r\n\r\nOn my last day in Seattle, due to some combination of poor planning and cheapness, I had to spend an inordinate amount of time at SEATAC airport, pre-security. I was basically at the airport 8 hours before my flight, a personal record. I thought Southwest would at least let me check my bags and go through security maybe 3-4 hours before the 5am flight, but their counter only opened an hour and a half before the flight. So I have no real opinions on whether SEATAC is a good airport or not lol.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I'll leave you with some pictures!\r\n\r\nSeattle photo dump:\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/Q6yBFyk\"a href=\"//imgur.com/a/Q6yBFyk\"Seattle/a/blockquotescript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"/script\r\n\r\nMoPOP photo dump (part 1):\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/45uzuCk\"a href=\"//imgur.com/a/45uzuCk\"/a/blockquotescript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"/script\r\n\r\nMoPOP photo dump (part 2) - scfi and fantasy\r\n\r\nblockquote class=\"imgur-embed-pub\" lang=\"en\" data-id=\"a/KgOUcEX\"a href=\"//imgur.com/a/KgOUcEX\"MoPOP part 2/a/blockquotescript async src=\"//s.imgur.com/min/embed.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"/script",

Maybe? IDK, we'll see.\r\n\r\nSince I was in the US, I took the opportunity to finish watching Voltron: Legendary Defender which only had two seasons available on PH Netflix. Pretty good adaptation, lots of fun callbacks to the old series. Some annoying filler eps, especially in the middle seasons onwards. I like how they spent the entire series going through the main Voltron villains one by one: first Zarkon, then Lotor, then a little bit of Sendak, then finally Hagar. It got a bit too hocus pocus magicky BS near the finale for me, but overall a pretty good watch.\r\n\r\nWhile we were staying with relatives in the US, it turns out they're really fond of watching Filipino movies. I'm not big on Filipino movies, most of them seem either uninspired, formulaic or outright ridiculous. I did enjoy a couple of the ones that I sat through, at least enough to comment on them, coincidentally both starring Eddie Garcia (RIP). The first one was Rainbow's Sunset, which has Eddie Garcia playing a senior citizen ex-politician who comes out as gay and explores the repurcussions to his children and grandchildren. This movie had a strange ending that came out of nowhere though. The second movie was Heaven's Waiting where Garcia portrays an old man who has died and finds himself in a waiting area before he can be sent to heaven, basically purgatory. In this place he finds an old flame of his from his youth, who has secretly been waiting for him all this time, refusing to advance to heaven. The movie explores themes of life and death and love and regret and commitment, but in a context outside of the typical Filipino love team movie.\r\n\r\nThere were a bunch of other Netflix movies watched - these folks didn't have that much to do at home - but the only other one I remember sitting through was Murder Mystery starring Adam Sandler and Jennifer Aniston. Basically a comedic whodunnit, it was entertaining enough to sit through, but nothing too special. I did like the car chase scene at the end though.\r\n\r\nAside from watching on Netflix, I also tried out an American cinema and watched Spider-man Far From Home with a friend. I have a separate blog post for it.\r\n\r\nMurder Mystery might not have been too special, but it did inspire me to watch the copy I had of Murder on the Orient Express when I got back home. It was my first exposure to Hercule Poirot, and I was pleasantly surprised by the star-studded cast. It's the sort of movie where you can't watch it twice though; I suppose all whodunits are like that, but now I can't watch the older movie based on this book. There's supposedly a sequel coming out next year, maybe I'll watch that.\r\n\r\nAfter the trip, there was a whole lot of shows to catch up on. The only one I managed to complete was Jessica Jones S3, the final season among the erstwhile Netflix-Marvel shows. I liked this season, mostly because it went way more dark than I expected and had a very \"Criminal Minds\"/procedural kind of vibe since her main antagonist here was a serial killer, and one of the themes is how a hero has to play by the rules and can't just do whatever he wants like killing criminals. (This kind of message always resonates with me now because of where the country is.) While I feel like it might have been better to cap the Netflix-Marvel venture with Daredevil's fantastic season 3, this one isn't a bad ending either. I suspect I will do a more detailed look back on these shows soonish.\r\n\r\nLike I said, I have a ton of shows to catch up on. Good Omens, Stranger Things, Doom Patrol, Legion, etc to name a few. And I missed out on a few movies though, like Dark Phoenix, which I was tempted to watch in the cinema despite the bad reviews, because I've never missed any of the prior X-Men movies, not even Wolverine Origins. Hopefully I'll have time to catch up on all of this stuff before the Fall TV season comes in!",

Which meant when I flew back home with them during the recent trip, we came back with an additional 3 fully-packed pieces of luggage full of shoes and clothes and such. As someone who doesn't really indulge in shopping, I can't relate to this, and in fact it runs anathema to my philosophy of always packing as little as necessary when travelling.\r\n\r\nThen there are people I know (mostly younger people) who seem to be travelling every weekend or every other weekend and they're always at the beach or some tourist spot or exotic location. I find this difficult to relate to as well, not only because that seems like an unnecessarily expensive lifestyle, but if you're \"getting away\" every weekend, won't that sort of thing become routine?\r\n\r\nIn general, I don't view travelling as a vacation or as a rest period. Travelling is expensive and stressful and can be anxiety-inducing. Not my idea of vacation or rest. For me travel is either purposeful (usually for me that means either work trips or playing Magic Grand Prix), or as a tourist (something I've only started doing as recently as the last 5 years).\r\n\r\nI think the real value of travel is in getting a chance to step away from your daily routines. Stepping out from your usual environments and the familiar culture around you and immersing in something different. Experiencing something different lets you challenge your own culture and world view. \r\n\r\nAnd when we come back from our travel, when we reacquaint ourselves with what we had before, we get to see our old rhythms and comfort zones with fresh eyes. What used to be routine may look different in light of recent experiences. When resuming old habits we get to ask a fresh set of \"Why?\", \"Do I really need this?\", or \"Could this be done better?\". We gain a newfound appreciation of things we missed. And hopefully, we are changed for the better.\r\n\r\nI think that's where the value is. We travel so we can be forever changed.\r\n\r\n",

Click here for the index!\r\n\r\nI've had these archives for a while and only now decided to put them up on the site. It's fun browsing through the older versions, basically relics of a bygone era. It was a time of hand-made HTML, CSS and JS, something that appealed to the tinkerer in me. I remember a disdain for things like Dreamweaver's WYSIWYG site building, or the site-builder tools that came with these free webhosts. Real men build their HTML by hand! It was a lot of effort to maintain websites back then, but I had a lot of fun.\r\n\r\nSome highlights:\r\n\r\nmy obvious love for green-text-on-black-background color schemes (and unnecessarily small fonts apparently), harkening back to the computer terminals of old\r\nmany, many broken links and missing files\r\nHTML documentation of my undergraduate thesis. There's more documents from my EEE days buried in these archives somewhere if you feel like digging for them. Maybe someday I'll go through them in detail.\r\nFinal Fantasy meets Magic the Gathering - a custom card set I made in 2001 (!) which shows both how much I loved the FF series and how bad I was at balancing MTG cards. (TBF to me, balancing in MTG overall wasn't that good back in those days)\r\na half-assed attempt at an rk (rurouni kenshin) fansite - that's literally the title in the pages \r\nrunning documentary of me trying to learn Win32 programming for gamedev purposes (largely unfinished)\r\n\r\nI thought about including all of this stuff in the blog's git repo, but decided against it because:\r\n\r\nthere's a LOT of files, it would unnecessarily increase the size of the repo\r\nI don't expect to be making updates to this content often once I've uploaded them\r\nI haven't vetted all the files, just the pages; there might be some stuff floating around in there that's not exactly legal (read: piracy). I've cleaned up what I can, but we don't want to run afoul of Github's policies or whatever so better safe than sorry\r\n\r\nMost of the blog-like content had already been absorbed into this blog previously. It's fun to go through some of the other stuff too, like looking at a snapshot of the sort of things or sites or files I was interested in almost 20 years ago (unsurprisingly, mostly the same things as today!)\r\n\r\n\r\n",

I haven't used it much beyond standard ANSI sql stuff. You won't always have a graphical interface to access your database, sometimes you need to ssh to prod and query the database from the shell. \r\n\r\nThe command line for PostgreSQL is psql. You can do:\r\n\r\npsql [database-user-name] -d [database-name] and it should prompt you for your password.\r\n\r\nBut when I tried this today, I got:\r\n\r\npsql: FATAL:  Peer authentication failed for user \"[database-user-name]\"\r\n\r\nThe problem had something to do with the permissions available to my ssh user. The workaround was to tell psql I was doing this from the local machine:\r\n\r\npsql: FATAL:  Peer authentication failed for user \"[database-user-name]\" -h 127.0.0.1\r\n\r\nWorked fine.\r\n\r\nAfter connecting, you get a prompt that looks like this:\r\n\r\n[database-name]=# \r\n\r\nNow, when I connected today, I had to do some queries, but I wasn't superfamiliar with the project's schema, and would have to muck around to find table names and field names. The psql shell provides some handy shortcuts for that:\r\n\r\n\\dt - outputs a list of tables\r\n\r\n\\d [table-name] - describes a specific table, showing field names\r\n\r\nYou can also just directly run an SQL query, just make sure to end it with a semicolon.\r\n\r\nIf the command outputs a lot of records, it will show them to you in a page-able vim-like format. You can recognize it when it stops with a : after each page and you can hit spacebar to proceed, and at the end it shows (END). And like vim, you might not know how to get out of this view. I had to google it myself, you just have to hit q to go back to the psql shell.\r\n\r\n",

        "content": "---\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2019-08-07 00:00:00\r\ntags:\r\ngaming\r\ntitle: \"Fighting Games\"\r\ntype: post\r\nfeaturedImage: https://roytang.net/uploads/2019/ssf2shinkuhadouken.gif\r\n---\r\n\r\nThis past weekend was EVO 2019, the world's biggest celebrations of fighting games. If I had stayed in the US another month maybe I could have gone to Vegas to attend and lose badly. Instead, I thought I'd write about fighting games.\r\n\r\nI consider fighting games one of my weaknesses, in the sense that (a) I easily succumb to the temptation to spend money on them; and (b) I'm not very good at them. Example of (a): I'm pretty sure I've purchased Street Fighter IV on at least 4 different platforms, including all DLC. Example of (b): I have yet to advance past bronze rank in online Street Fighter V, despite having purchased the game at launch back in 2016.\r\n\r\nLike many in my generation, I got my introduction to fighting games with the arcade release of Street Fighter II in the arcades in the early 90s. Prior to that, my arcade experience had been mostly side-scrolling beat-em ups like the old X-Men arcade game. I remember my brother and I literally playing the SF2 arcade release like \"scrubs\", i.e., often times scrubbing our palms over the buttons trying to get moves going. Back then arcade machines didn't come with instructions and you had to figure out how the character moves worked by experimentation. I remember he preferred playing Ryu/Ken, while I liked Guile. We didn't really do combos, most of the time we just did Flash Kicks (which we called the \"Slice\"), Sonic Booms, Fireballs, and Dragon Punches most of the time. We also found it hard to understand what the Japanese characters were saying; we called Ryu's hurricane kick the \"Kat-kat-nougat\" because that's what it sounded like he was shouting! The other characters were mysteries! We didn't know how Zangief worked for example. And I'm pretty sure we never finished the arcade mode.\r\n\r\nStreet Fighter II eventually got a home release, I remember playing it for the first time at a friend's house when he got his copy first. We would be playing SF2 on the SNES a lot. I remember the annoyance when playing SF2 at another person's house, I'd have to configure my controller because I didn't use the default button layout. I used a layout called \"YXLBAR\" (with the heavy attacks on the SNES shoulder buttons) instead of the default \"YLXBRA\". Rumor has it someone used an insane layout like \"YBAXLR\". I also remember seeing the arcade intro for the updated Super Street Fighter II and being so amazed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe tried out some other fighting game franchises on SNES too, like the Japanese Dragonball Butoden series, a TMNT fighting game, and the Justice League Task Force fighting game. On the PC, we also had a copy of Mortal Kombat 1. I'm not even sure our PC could handle color back then, we may have been playing Mortal Kombat in black and white! We also didn't have controllers for the PC back then, so we had to play with two players to one keyboard, and if you held down four buttons or more on your side, the keyboard couldn't register any more additional inputs so your opponent couldn't move!\r\n\r\nAside from playing with my brothers, me and some HS friends often got together at a friend's house and would be playing fighting games 'til the early morning hours. We got to try a lot more fighting games in the PS1 era, since games were cheaper in the PH then. A lot of it was still capcom stuff: Street Fighter Alpha 3, the Street Fighter EX series, Rival Schools, Darkstalkers, Xmen vs Street Fighter, and Marvel vs Capcom 1. There were also the games that were similar in command style like the King of Fighters series and Guilty Gear. We would also sometimes try the 3d games like Tekken, Soul Edge, Virtua Fighter, or Battle Arena Toshinden but those played a lot differently than SF-style games and they never really caught on with our group.\r\n\r\nThe PS2 era brought with it one of our most played games of all time: the legendary Capcom vs SNK 2. With a ridiculous 48 characters and six different \"grooves\" or playstyles to choose from, there was a lot of variety in the game and we rarely got tired of it. The Street Fighter III series also came out at around the same time, but we never got too much into it because New Generation and Second Impact only had home releases on Dreamcast; I remember we did play Third Strike for a while, but that was quickly overshadowed when CvS2 came out. There were a lot of other Capcom/SNK/other fighting game releases we tried out at this time too, but CvS2 was the main one I remember from this era.\r\n\r\nWith the PS3 era came Street Fighter IV and a new dimension: online play! This is where I got my first indication that I wasn't very good at fighting games, despite enjoying them so much. I was fine when playing on the couch casually with my friends, but online was another matter entirely. I remember being so frustrated at the \"ten wins in a row\" and \"get C rank for all characters\" achievements in SF4 because of how difficult they were. Around this time, my brother and I also tried attending a local tournament or two, but we did poorly. During this era, I also tried out games like Blazblue, Injustice, Persona 4 Arena, and so on. (ArcSys really got it's groove in this era as far as I'm concerned.)\r\n\r\nIt was during this era that I started preferring fight sticks as well. I bought my first fight stick for the PS3, and I found I liked it a lot more than playing with a controller. My play group still prefers controllers, so when I meet up with them I have to suck it up, but at home and for online play I'm usually on a fight stick. This generation also marked the first time for me to play the Smash Brothers series via the Wii U installment, but I never could get the hang of that game either.\r\n\r\nFinally that brings us to the PS4 era and of course Street Fighter V. SF5 isn't too popular these days, mainly due to some balancing issues and lack of innovation,making the game feel stale, but it's still very hype at EVO. My old play group doesn't get to play much anymore, mostly because the one who usually brought the console has moved abroad, but we still manage to meet up at least once a year or so and put up our fighting dukes. I still play SF5 online, though not as often as I did with SF4. Matchmaking is a lot tougher, probably because I've been stuck at bronze level all this time. I still get hyped for fighting games when EVO rolls around, and I'm always tempted to buy these flashy new fighting games that come out. Just this weekend I purchased Dragonball Fighter Z on Steam after trying it out for the free weekend and enjoying it. It helps that it has a lot of nice single-player content so I can justify the cost even if I don't win/play online too much. \r\n\r\nWhy am I so bad at fighting games? I'm sure part of it is old age - these days my reaction time isn't as good as I'd want it to be (maybe it never was?!?). A large part of it is due to laziness - fighting games take a lot of practice, and you need a lot of experience to do well online. You also need to put in the time in training to be able to pull off execution of more complicated moves like SF4's famous FADC. I don't have time to really play fighting games all the much anymore. I was doing slightly better online during the PS3 era because my play group and me and my brothers were still playing regularly, but with SF5, I don't really have anyone to practice offline with on a regular basis, and just spending a lot of time in training bores me, so here we are. \r\n\r\nWhy do I still enjoy playing fighting games so much even though I'm bad at them? I've thought about this a lot, and I think the main reason other than general competitiveness, is that I enjoy the spectacle (these days at least). It's one of the few genres where I can truly appreciate the over-the-top graphics and cool moves and supers and so on. When I get a new fighting game and try out a new character one of the first things I do is try to get a super off to see how cool it is. I also enjoy the variance in game play - which is why I prefer fighting games with larger rosters like CvS2, and I especially like it when there is a random character select option. When my play group meets up, we always do random character selection where possible, it exposes us to all the characters and everything the game has to offer.\r\n\r\nIn recent years it has become easier to enjoy fighting games even if you're not good at them or you don't have much time to play, since there's a lot more tournaments these days and many of them are live-streamed and available to watch on demand online. I still want to play the games, but when I can't find a match, watching tournament play is a good alternative.\r\n\r\nMy reflexes can only get worse as the years pass, but I'm sure I'll still be playing fighting games for years to come, and I'll probably buy Street Fighter VI day one when it comes out for the PS5 or whatever. I may not have the skills to be the world champion in fighting games, but I'll always be a street fighter at heart.",

        "content": "---\r\ncategories: []\r\ndate: 2019-08-01 05:56:56\r\ntags:\r\nbooks\r\ntitle: 'Book Review: Utopia for Realists by Rutger Bregman'\r\ntype: post\r\n---\r\n\r\nI forget where I got this book recommendation from, but it did go on sale for Kindle a while back so I got a copy. The full title is \"Utopia for Realists: How We Can Build the Ideal World\". \r\n\r\nSummary: I really like this book, though I think it falls short in providing concrete steps for how to get from where we are to the idealized utopia he presents. Still, in this world of ever-increasing bad news and crises, the optimism of this book is a welcome respite.\r\n\r\nThe book covers a number of \"utopian\" scenarios worth striving for, namely:\r\n\r\nuniversal basic income\r\nshorter work weeks\r\nopen borders\r\n\r\nEven before reading a book, I was already a believer in these ideals, well aware of the justifications. But the book covers that and more, providing a history of those ideas and what was tried before and why they failed and why we aren't there yet. The history is particularly interesting, as before this I had no idea how close the US came to implementing something like UBI in the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\nAs I said, there's very little concrete suggestions as to how to get there though. The author wails a bit about how progressives are stuck trying to protect the status quo instead of pushing forward truly progressive ideals such as these. The book also briefly covers such topics as biases and how difficult it is to push truly progressive ideas forward in the face of those biases. Aside from that, most of the advice seems to be \"keep on bringing these issues up, their time will come.\" \r\n\r\nTaking a critical eye to these issues leads me deeper into my disagreements with the hyperefficiency of capitalism because even though with detailed analysis these ideals may tend to hold up in terms of value, it will still be difficult convincing a society to pursue them when said society is focused on profit over all things. \r\n\r\nProbably a more detailed discussion of each issue is beyond the scope of this post and each one may even merit multiple additional posts on their own. \r\n\r\nInstead, here are some passages/quotes I found myself highlighting from the book:\r\n\r\nOn worrying about what other people think:\r\n\r\nOn inequality affecting people's self-image (explains a lot about the Philippines):\r\n\r\n Take bullying. Countries with big disparities in wealth also have more bullying behavior, because there are bigger status differences... the “psychosocial consequences” are such that people living in unequal societies spend more time worrying about how others see them. This undercuts the quality of relationships (manifested in a distrust of strangers and status anxiety, for example). The resulting stress, in turn, is a major determinant of illness and chronic health problems. \r\n\r\nOn why performance-driven societies may not be optimal (i.e. capitalsm's focus on efficiency may not be best):\r\n\r\n As the writer Kevin Kelly says, “Productivity is for robots. Humans excel at wasting time, experimenting, playing, creating, and exploring.” Governing by numbers is the last resort of a country that no longer knows what it wants, a country with no vision of utopia. \r\n\r\nOn shorter work weeks:\r\n\r\n What Ford, Kellogg, and Heath had all discovered is that productivity and long work hours do not go hand in hand. In the 1980s, Apple employees sported T-shirts that read, “Working 90 hours a week and loving it!” Later, productivity experts calculated that if they had worked half the hours then the world might have enjoyed the groundbreaking Macintosh computer a year earlier. There are strong indications that in a modern knowledge economy, even forty hours a week is too much. Research suggests that someone who is constantly drawing on their creative abilities can, on average, be productive for no more than six hours a day. It's no coincidence that the world's wealthy countries, those with a large creative class and highly educated populations, have also shaved the most time off their workweeks. \r\n\r\nOn the cult of busy:\r\n\r\n Nowadays, excessive work and pressure are status symbols. Moaning about too much work is often just a veiled attempt to come across as important and interesting. Time to oneself is sooner equated with unemployment and laziness, certainly in countries where the wealth gap has widened. \r\n\r\nOn \"bullshit jobs\":\r\n\r\n Bizarrely, it's precisely the jobs that shift money around–creating next to nothing of tangible value–that net the best salaries. It's a fascinating, paradoxical state of affairs. How is it possible that all those agents of prosperity–the teachers, the police officers, the nurses–are paid so poorly, while the unimportant, superfluous, and even destructive shifters do so well? \r\n\r\nThis one I highlighted because I found it a questionable ideal at best, he offers no explanation for why this should be true:\r\n\r\n If we restructure education around our new ideals, the job market will happily tag along. Let's imagine we were to incorporate more art, history, and philosophy into the school curriculum. You can bet there will be a lift in demand for artists, historians, and philosophers. \r\n\r\nOn how even smart people are not immune to cognitive dissonance:\r\n\r\n Smart people, concludes the American journalist Ezra Klein, don't use their intellect to obtain the correct answer; they use it to obtain what they want to be the answer. \r\n\r\nNever give up!\r\n\r\n But Solomon Asch made another discovery. A single opposing voice can make all the difference. When just one other person in the group stuck to the truth, the test subjects were more likely to trust the evidence of their own senses. Let this be an encouragement to all those who feel like a lone voice crying out in the wilderness: Keep on building those castles in the sky. Your time will come. \r\n\r\nOn not focusing too much on work:\r\n\r\n A few years ago, Australian writer Bronnie Ware published a book titled The Top Five Regrets of the Dying, about patients she had tended during her nursing career. 2 And guess what? No one said he or she would have liked to pay closer attention to coworkers' PowerPoint presentations or to have brain-stormed a little more on disruptive co-creation in the network society. The biggest regret was: \"I wish I'd had the courage to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me.\" Number two: \"I wish I didn't work so hard.\" \r\n\r\nOverall a very good read, despite my criticisms, and a lot of his thought appeal to my own ideals personally.
